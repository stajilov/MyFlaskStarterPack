            This excellent piece of Samsonite  Luggage ""Screams "" mid-Century!!  As I look at this case mid-century visions of boarding a sleek Tri-Star PAN-AM airplane headed for Hawaii enters my mind. With that being said I have left the travel sticker attached. 
The classic style of this hard body case is apparent and the quality of Samsonite luggage is well proven with this suitcase. 
The case measures 21 inches long 13 inches wide and is about 6 inches deep. The inside has a divider and several tie downs,  all pieces are in fine condition and are in great working order. Sorry no key included.
This is one of the finest pieces of vintage Samsonite luggage I have seen in this business and I am very proud to offer it to my customers. 
Thank you for looking and please enjoy looking at other vintage items in the shop. Dave

Just a note; we sell more of these style shorts than any other item.  Because I know many of you want these for your weddings (and because weddings are pretty important to us), I will do everything I can to accommodate you. All I ask is that you please ask me (prior to purchasing) if you need them sooner than the processing times allow so that I can make sure I can help you. This is because I use old fashioned techniques and sew a parts of these shorts by hand (by that I mean with a needle and thread~Not using a sewing machine).  So they do take time.

            Vintage smoky rhinestone parure by Weiss in excellent  condition. All rhinestones are clear, present, and prong-set in rhodium. There is very slight aging (yellowing) to some of the clear rhinestones in the bracelet, as can be seen in the pictures. The earrings are clip-on, but can be converted to pierced. The necklace has a unique clasp, which makes it lay flat. The bracelet has a fold-over clasp, as well as a safety chain. The clasp opens and closes perfectly, and will stay closed once it has been latched. The safety chain works perfectly. 
Perfect for a wedding, anniversary, bridal shower, engagement party, etc.

1542,Attachable Bicycle 'CEV' Odometer - Made in Italy - 'Brevettato' - Mileage on Your Bike - For The Bicycling Expert - Bike Part,"
            Here is a vintage CEV bicycle odometer Made in Italy by Brevettato. This is a really fun accessory from a recycled Sears Roebuck bicycle that was disassembled for parts.  The code/parts (?) number that came with the odometer is 503.47.396 and there is also a small metal bracket with a screw that I believe was attached to a spoke.  It has been used, but I believe will still work.  The workings are all up to you - no guarantee.
Please convo for a Canadian, international or combined shipping cost.

2240,Vintage Silver Bermuda enamel Fish charm. Bermuda bracelet charm featuring a fish.,"
            Vintage Bermuda Fish enamel charm for a bracelet or as a pendant the choice is yours. Marked Sterling with makers stamp BMCo. Vibrant enamelled blues and greens. 
I tend not to clean silver vintage jewellery or coins as I'm not an expert and would be cautious to damage any stones etc. Also many prefer the naturally aged look and enjoy these pieces just as they are... worn and loved. I'm sure if desired it will polish up beautifully.

3158,Soft vintage Wool Blanket Hudson's Bay Style Stripes in cream and blue 70 x 52 all wool camp blanket,"
            Really soft, beautifully aged Hudson Bay STYLE wool blanket perfect for your bed, sofa, or campfire. Has that fantastic rustic look to it, and has been softened with age and use. It feels soft and looks great, I love the red on cream stripes, it screams COZY.
Label Reads Eatonia All Wool. I believe this was for the Eatons Department store. Fairly thick and soft, a good camp blanket. It does show some flaws around the edges, and about 3 greyish spots in the cream, And a few puncture-style holes, see photos for examples.  Perfect for use at the cottage or hunt camp for a rustic feel!
Could also be used for raw wool for a felting project like a felted wool jacket!

3529,"Vintage Baby Coat, Coat and Bonnet, Large Doll Coat, Pink Baby Coat, Baby Clothes, Pink Coat and Hat, Vintage Baby Jacket","
            Vintage hand made pink baby girl coat and bonnet with cream colored lining. I think it is silk or a polyester type material. It has a hand embroidered flower and leaf design all over.
It does have a bit of wear. There is a 1"" tear on the seam of the back of the shoulder and a couple of small worn spots and a light yellowish stain that I have not addressed, on the collar. It is missing one button, and the bonnet needs a new snap (one side is missing), and also has a yellowish stain on the back of the bonnet.  Looks like it would be about a 18-24 months size. I'm guessing, so please take note of my measurements. They used to wear toddler dresses and coats a lot shorter, just past the rear, so it is a bit wider for the length that it is. (Does that make sense?!)  Measurements:
Bodice width: 10"" across flares to 18"" at bottom
Length: 14""
Sleeve length: 9""
So adorable! It would also be great for a large vintage doll.

No tears, scratches or inconsistent stains..the cardboard border framing is nicely tattered.. especially, along the black border cardboard..consistent with its age. It's a gem of yesteryear and would look great framed. The photo stands proudly at approx.

About Vintage Eyewear:
Vintage Frames tend to run small so please measure carefully. Please take a look at the measurements that I have provided for you.
Small Imperfections and slight adjustments are normal on most vintage frames, even new old stock, due to the age and sitting folded in a box for 30-50 years. When you take your frames to have lenses installed they can be adjusted. If any major defects or damage is present I will list in the item description.
Please read other store policies before buying.

5280,VINTAGE large Edward GOREY print / poster 1970s DRACULA and Lucy Vampire Gothic goth Count Dracula gory Moon,"
            This is a wonderful large-scale print that features the artwork of EDWARD GOREY. The print features an illustration titled DRACULA and LUCY, originally done for the New York Times Book Review. This illustration is much more intricate than Gorey's usual cross-hatch method, and seems to have involved some ink washes as well. The image is striking - Count Dracula in pursuit of a trance-like Lucy, who is emerging from a cave that looks like a creature's jaws! The trees and moon above make it look even more monstrous. 
The print was part of a folio of work published in 1979 - the back bears the number 52 and a smaller illustration from another New York Times illustration.
It measures approx. 15 1/2"" x 11"" - with the image this large you can really see the intricate line work that Edward Gorey was famous for. It is in overall good condition. There are a few faint ""foxing"" marks in the white border area (those pale yellow stains common in aging paper).  The print comes well-packed for shipping.
Suitable for framing, this would make a special gift for the Edward Gorey enthusiast, or the perfect addition to your own collection. Just in time for Halloween!
about Edward Gorey: 
A truly prodigious and original artist, Edward St. John Gorey (1925-2000), gave to the world over one hundred works, including The Gashlycrumb Tinies, The Doubtful Guest and The Wuggly Ump; prize-winning set and costume designs for innumerable theater productions from Cape Cod to Broadway; in 1978 he won a Tony Award for Costume design on the Broadway production of ""Dracula."" A remarkable number of illustrations in publications such as The New Yorker and The New York Times, and in books by a wide array of authors including Samuel Beckett, T.S. Eliot, John Updike, Charles Dickens, Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll, Hilaire Belloc, John Ciardi, Muriel Spark, Edmund Wilson, Peter Neumeyer, Virginia Woolf, H.G. Wells, Florence Parry Heide, Bram Stoker, Raymond Chandler, Gilbert & Sullivan, and many others. His well known animated credits for the PBS ""Mystery"" series have introduced him to millions of television viewers. Gorey's masterful pen and ink illustrations and his ironic, offbeat humor have brought him critical acclaim and an avid following throughout the world.

5422,Extremely rare 1940's Hermes belt with shield shaped escutcheon and key details. Amazing!!,"
            From my personal collection comes this unbelievable original late 1940's Hermes belt. 
As a jewellery collector, I have to say I had a hard time listing this in this ""belts"" category as it is really a piece of jewellery. The belt is designed to be worn at the natural waist and measures 32"" in full length, best suited for a 23-28 inch waist. 
This belt is decorated with 5 shield keyhole escutcheons and finished at the buckle with their signature Hermes key. 
The belt is in amazing condition given the age, but does have some slight oxidation to a couple of the shields. I am happy to provide more photos for interested parties.
This belt would look amazing with high waisted jeans, over a fitted dress, or simply to be enjoyed as a collectors piece. The quality is befitting that of Hermes and it is an amazing treasure.
Please feel free to message me with questions.
Review my policies as many of your questions may be answered there.

            ***********************************
Snuffle mats are shipped the day after your order is placed via priority mail from zip code 29707.
***********************************
The original snuffle mat on Etsy - Hundreds of happy customers, please read my reviews to see why!
An exciting food puzzle toy for your dog!  This toy uses your dog's natural ability to snuffle and root around to search for things using their sense of smell. Their snuffle mat will provide lots of stimulation as they search for kibble or treats that you have scattered in the mat. Mental stimulation can be tiring for your dog, so using this toy can wear them out and help them relax!
Visit my Facebook page for videos of happy dogs using their snuffle mats! https://www.facebook.com/PetDogTrainer
The base is heavy rubber tied with hundreds of pieces of bright multi-colored fleece so the treats are challenging but not impossible to find. The base of this large snuffle mat is 12 inches square, overall size is approximately 18 inches square. Assorted colors.  The dog in the photo is ""Karma"", my 55 pound German Shorthaired Pointer. (Dog not included!) :-)
Start out by scattering a few treats on top of the toy that your dog can easily find. Next time scatter the treats then lightly brush the toy so the treats fall into the fleece. As with any toy, please monitor your dog's interaction with this toy to make sure they are using it appropriately.
I ship these mats to the US only via Priority Mail. If you live in Charlotte, NC or Fort Mill, SC message me to arrange pickup and avoid shipping charges.        ",35.00,4.9731,"Handmade item

6418,"Pet loss Necklace, Lock of Hair Necklace, Pet memorial gift, Loss of a Pet, Memorial Jewelry, Glass Floating Locket Fur Ashes Dog Keepsake","
            A few tears were shed making this special necklace not long after my beautiful Rocky passed, he was 14 years old and the best thing that ever happened to me ♥ He now has a new home in my heart, and when I wear this necklace, I feel him even closer, like an angel checking up on me from time to time, making sure i'm happy and smiling :)
I would love to spread this gift to others who've also experienced the loss of a pet, a dog or a cat, or maybe a pet snake. If your pet's name is no more than 7 letters in length, I can hand-stamp their name on a beautiful stainless steel heart blank which sits beautifully on top of the fur.
The locket itself is made with a strong magnetic closure so you will be able to open this when you receive the necklace and securely place the fur, hair, ashes or any other tiny ornaments of your beloved that may fit inside. 
The photos above show the front side of the pendant with the hand-stamped heart and the back of the locket which contains a tiny photo that can be placed behind the fur once you've enclosed it inside.
So..... all you need to do is:
1. In the ""Note to seller"" box at Checkout, include the name of your pet (must be 7 letters or less)
2. Attach the photo you'd like to hold inside your locket via an Etsy Convo to me (or, once you've placed the order at Checkout, use the ""Contact seller"" link to send me a message with the attached photo).
♥~ ITEM DETAILS ~♥
✤ Glass floating locket is made of stainless steel and measures approx. 1"" (30mm) in diameter and 0.2"" (5mm) in thickness
✤ Locket frame is complete with a pre-soldered bail used to hang the chain from. 
✤ Necklace features a stunning antique silver angel wing charm measuring approx. 3cm in length. 
✤ Pendant hangs off a dainty stainless steel cable chain, measuring 24"" (60cm) in length)
Stainless steel is a great alternative to sterling silver. It is very affordable, hypoallergenic, robust and will not tarnish or change colour over time.
Add more hand-stamped heart floating charms to your locket, personalised with the names of your choice (e.g. if you have multiple pets):

This charcoal grey penguin baby blanket created from Japanese 6-ply cotton gauze is as soft as it is beautiful and adorable with each wash it becomes softer and more cuddly.
Japanese 100% cotton gauze is very popular fabric, especially for baby items in Japan.
This item would be perfect for a new baby boy and baby girl, or as a gift for a baby shower.
Approx. size: 24"" x 34"" / 63cm x 87cm

The gauze fabric is more delicate than other cotton weaves; as such, it requires more gentle treatment to keep looking good. 
Hot water promotes shrinking and should not be used for cotton gauze.
 
Care instructions: 
Hand wash or Machine wash in cold or lukewarm water with delicate cycle; air dry or tumble dry, low; do not bleach.
Please wash before use.
Cotton gauze fabric is non-bleached cotton so you might find tiny specks are peace of cotton.

Our monogrammed newborn baby blankets are the prefect way to do just that!  As a photographer, graphic artist and mother for 4, I wanted to create something special and unique for every baby!  I created my first blanket for my own child so that I could lay him on it each month and track his growth each month! :)
Our baby blanket will be custom designed for the baby you are celebrating!  I will work with you to pick out the perfect colors, fonts, words, and design so that together we create something truly one of a kind and personalized to that baby!  Every baby deserves to be celebrated, I would love to help you do that!
Our blankets are printed with archival inks on premium fleece.  The blankets are not only soft and snuggly, but are also durable, standing the test of time. 
RECEIVING BLANKET:  This blanket is a lower pile fleece and has some stretch to it, it is great for swaddling babies up!
HEIRLOOM BLANKET: This blanket is made of superior fleece and is a soft, more fuzzy fleece.  This blanket is an heirloom blanket because it is meant to be snuggled with for years! :)

FAQs can be seen on our website at www.plumpaper.com/faq/
__________________________________________________________________
ORDERING PROCESS:
When placing your order, please complete the following steps:
1: Drop Down Menu Selections:
- Weekly Spread Option (Option 1, 2, 3, or 4 - can be seen in 2nd photo of this listing).
- Month you would like your planner to start in.
2. In the ""NOTE TO SELLER"" box that appears before checkout, please include the following:
- Name for cover 
See ""PERSONALIZATION DETAILS” below for specific instructions regarding your name. PLEASE read these details!
__________________________________________________________________
PERSONALIZATION DETAILS:
YOUR NAME:
--- The name will be written in the same style that is on the sample planner of your purchase. If the name is in all lowercase on the sample, we will write your name in all lowercase for your cover.
If you would like the name to be written in a different style than the sample shows, please specify this in the Note to Seller box with a description of what you would like.
NOTES EXAMPLE: ""Please write the name in all capital letters: SARAH JEAN"" or ""Please capitalize only the first letter of each name: Sarah Jean""
IMPORTANT - Your order MUST INCLUDE an explanation if you would like your name written different than the sample shows.
--- If your notes just say ""Sarah Jean"" without an explanation like the above example, it will be written out just like the sample shows. Therefore, if the sample is in all lowercase, the name on the planner will read ""sarah jean"". If the sample shows all capital letters, the name on the planner would read ""SARAH JEAN”.
--- If you do not want your name on the cover, please specify this in the notes section of your order. (Pattern will continue instead)
YOUR MONOGRAM:
--- Middle letter in a monogram is your last name initial. If your name is ""Molly Ann Smith"", your monogram should read “MSA"".
--- We will write your letters exactly as you write them in your order. If you write ""MAS"" instead of ""MSA"", we will put the monogram as ""MAS"". Please be careful to write your monogram EXACTLY as you want it written.
--- Monogram must be 3 letters.
--- If you do not want a monogram on the cover, please specify this in the notes section of your order. (Pattern will continue instead)

9358,"My Family Finger Puppet Play Set , Sold Individually or as a Set","
            You are looking at a full family finger puppet set. This is a set of 5 puppets - daddy, mommy, sister, brother, and baby - all fitting snugly onto the tips of the fingers of children and adults alike. They measure approximately 3"" wide by 4"" tall. The family is constructed of two layers of felt, sandwiching a layer of stabilizer in between.
Each puppet is constructed in the hoop of my embroidery machine and comes from my smoke free home.
You may buy each puppet individually, or as a set of 5. You can also add on individual puppets to the set to mimic your own family!
Thanks for looking!  Have a great day!
----------------------------------------------
Answers to Questions You May Have:
----------------------------------------------
When will I receive my order?
I am a made-to-order shop. I create your items after I receive payment. For single items or sets with less than 4 items in them, please allow 1-2 weeks for me to complete your order and prepare it to ship. For larger sets or multiple items (more than 4), I ask that you allow 2-3 weeks for the item to ship. I always ship first class, unless otherwise requested and paid for.
I do my best to complete items in the order that they are received. If you need your item quicker, whether it be for a special event or whatever reason you choose, please let me know! You can choose to pay a rush fee of 10. This is a separate listing that you can request from me. You can just add it to your cart with your order. I will get your order to you by your request date, and will upgrade your shipping to USPS Priority Mail.
While I ask for either 1-2 or 2-3 weeks on items, please know that I always strive to get your items to you as soon as possible. If you have a special event coming, like a birthday or a baby shower, I am super flexible and almost always willing to work with you on your deadline!
Can I change the thread or fabric colors?/Did you design this?
I have no problems changing a color scheme. I can make a blonde a brunette or give someone brown eyes over blue. A red dress can be made purple. Changes like this are no big deal, at all.
BUT
That being said, there is a difference to changing a color compared to changing a design. I am not a digitizer. Sometimes I can do minor design changes. I can leave out a hair bow if it doesn't compromise the hair line, if that makes sense. But beyond minor changes, I am unable to alter designs. I, like you, am a consumer. I buy designs from awesome digitizers to be able to stitch out on finished products. Some digitizers wear a double hat and sell their designs as finished products, so they would be able to change designs. But I only wear one hat!
Will my item look exactly like it does in the listing photo?
Not always, and not necessarily. For bibs, they may differ slightly as the ones shown for appliqué fabric. I use what I have in stock, and try my best to stick with the color schemes presented in the photos. If you have your heart set on a certain fabric, or like the design, but the fabric I happened to use in the example doesn’t work for you, please just say so. I want you to be 100% with your order. For puppets, 99% of the time, they will look exactly as they do in the photo. The only time this changes is for characters like Granny and Red Riding Hood, as their clothing is not made of felt, it is cotton. So the same rule of thumb applies as with the bib applique fabrics. Dress Up Dolls will follow the same rules as Red and Granny.
Do you combine shipping?
Shipping costs will be combined automatically when individual listings are added to your cart and purchased in the same transaction.        ",4.00,4.9318,"Handmade item

            Horizon: Zero Dawn
Aloy's Necklace
Up for sale are highly accurate replicas of the necklace Aloy wears in the PS4 game ""Horizon: Zero Dawn"". In the game, Aloy wears it as a baby during her name ceremony and later on receives it as a parting gift from Rost, the outcast who raised her. A great piece if you collect gameprops, want a momentum of this awesome game or want to compliment your Cosplay costume.
The master pattern and the beads (which had to be custom made) were made using various screencaptures from the game to make it as accurate as possible. The pendant and beads are made from degassed resin to avoid airbubbles in the castings. The resin for the beads was dyed rather than painted to prevent wear. The pendant has a bone/ivory color as a base and was weathered to look aged and worn. The string is made of braided faux brown leather and has adjustable sliding knots so you can make the necklace shorter if needed.
Each pendant is handfinished and may therefor look slightly different than in the pictures.

9915,Vintage red phone Iskra ETA 62 - Retro Yugoslavian Rotary Telephone,"
            Rare Vintage Rotary Telephone - Iskra ETA 62 - Made in Yugoslavia, it was the first completely electro-mechanical telephone in the world (1976.) 
This model here is Iskra ETA 62, today a very rare telephone even in former Yugoslavia.
It is in a fair vintage condition. The red color is just stunning. It has scratches here and there, from everyday use.
Iskra, a company from Kranj in Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia) was very known by quality of products and their technologically advanced telephones were built with highest quality standards.
A must-have phone for collectors!
 This phone has not been tested, but I suppose it is in working condition, since everything is on its place. However vintage phones worked on a different system (rotary dialing sent the pulses for forming a number) than the modern ones (they use digital signals), so they need to be rewired. 
This can be done by following these instructions:

The phone is in a very nice vintage condition and the best part is.... It is actually working.
I have a lot of experience with these phones, I have been selling them for years. I have thoroughly checked it, lubricated the insides, adjusted the buzzer, replaced the gasket and gave it back some of its original shine.

When the game is over, the Tower lays down in its tray for easy storage.  Tower is constructed from 1/4"" Red Oak and measures approximately 3 1/4"" W x 3 1/4"" D x 6"" T.  Tray is slightly larger with 1"" high sides and foam feet to protect your furniture.  Tower and tray are sanded to a smooth finish.  Dice Tower is shipped unstained with your choice of foam color from the samples shown or suede leather. Note: Color of final product may vary to that shown due to your monitor's color setting and manufacturer's process.

Our wigs are designed to permanently replace your doll’s original wig. Our wigs will not fit on a dolls head with already existing hair. They fit very snug!

This is a heat safe wig. Safe for use up to 250°. Although, I strongly recommend never going higher then 150°. ALL irons differ and many irons have an inconsistency of heat. I recommend a digital iron. I have tested all my wigs and 150° Styles fabulous! It only takes 3-4 seconds to achieve one curl. Please don't over heat, it can scorch the wig.

            Blind Date with a Book: Pick a book based solely on a few identifiers, following the idea of not judging a book by its cover. 
Books are brand new paperbacks so there's no worry about what quality book you'll receive. 
Pre-Loved books are used but like new. The only damage you would find is bends in the spine. Because these books are used, they are cheaper. 
For Comics please see: http://tinyurl.com/hj87wtn
For Mystery Book-Lover Boxes please see: http://tinyurl.com/zsb9tua
((The image provided is purely for example of how the books will look, please check the selections to see which styles are available. ))
Please let me know if you have any queries about how it works.

            Get him a piece of jewelry that he will actually want to wear. Something that shows just how stylish he is without saying a word.
Olive Wood is deeply contrasted with offset Black Walnut giving this piece a real wow factor. Completed with a polished brass center to really highlight the difference in the two woods.
An enduring symbol of peace, Olive was traditionally worn for weddings and victory celebrations. 
This eye-catching ring measures 5mm wide (approximately the thickness of 3 US Quarters) and has a gently rounded surface. It is 2.5mm thick (about 2 US Dimes). The inside is slightly rounded making this an extremely comfortable wear.
BEAUTIFUL RING - EXCELLENT SERVICE - DELIVERED ON TIME - GUARANTEED
HOW WOOD RINGS ARE MADE
The two sides of the ring are bonded through the brass insert. This locks all the pieces together, and makes a very strong ring.
Each ring is finished with a tough acrylic, and polished to a brilliant shine. This makes the rings waterproof and suitable for daily wear.
CUSTOMIZED WOOD RINGS
If you have a custom request, just send me a message. I'll be glad to work with you.
SIZING YOUR WOOD RING
The wood rings are slightly rounded on the inside for a ""comfort fit"". They tend to run about a half size larger than standard rings. So if you prefer a nice snug fit, subtract a half size from your normal size.
SHIPPING 
Shipping is free worldwide. When shipping outside the United States, you are responsible for any duties or taxes your country may charge.
WOOD RING WARRANTY
When your wood ring arrives, I hope you love it. And, I hope you're glad you chose my shop. If not, let me know! I'll make you happy. Won't fit; no problem. Clashes with your eye color; no problem. Allergic to wood; no problem. I'll make you happy, or refund your money. Period        ",135.00,4.8462,"Handmade item

            We are in LOVE with these table numbers. Being elevated allows them to be elegantly displayed without taking up much room. They will seamlessly blend in with your centerpiece arrangements. 
These numbers are laser cut from 1/8"" recycled fiber board.
Size
They are around 8-9.5"" tall (pending on tall letters (see photo with table number four:  f would be a tall letter being 4"" tall x 1"" wide, and o would be 1"" tall x 1"" wide) The height depends also on single numbers (ex.1) vs. stacked numbers (ex. 22). The width of these numbers starts at number 1 being 4"" wide, to number 17 being 8.5"" wide. If we have failed to answer any questions about the size of these numbers please send us a message.
*** Please allow 1-2 weeks lead time. We will do our best to get them to you in a timely matter. We work long hours,  and have many orders to fulfill.
Do they come assembled?
No, if they did... shipping would be a nightmare! We send them out flat. It is easy to assemble. Just slide the number into the base. It's as easy as that!
What colors does it come in?
You can choose the colors from the drop down menu above. We offer gold, gold glitter, silver, silver glitter, rose gold, rose gold glitter, black, and DIY.
What does DIY mean?
DIY means DO IT YOURSELF. This means you will receive the table numbers unpainted. SO, you will be in charge of painting them yourself.
Should I order DIY or painted?
If you are on a budget, or want a color we don't offer... DIY is the best option for you.
***How soon should I order?
We suggest you order 2 weeks prior to your wedding/event. We are quickly approaching wedding season, and will be pressed for time. We work long hours and want to ensure you get your table numbers in plenty of time. If you need a rush order please let us know before purchasing, so we can let you know if it's possible. 
***What information should I give you?
Please leave your wedding date in the ""note to seller"" section at the time of purchase, as well as a date you'd like to have them by. This will be a great way to keep us on track. Thank you in advance!        ",25.00,4.9318,"Handmade item

::: IMPORTANT INFORMATION and FAQ :::: 
{{ Details on Flatware }} 
→ All silverware in the shop is ""vintage"", meaning it's on its second chance on life. This also means that for each piece, I have treasure hunted for it, stamped it, polished, and then cleaned for use! There may be some signs of wear from its previous life, but that is the beauty of the creation. I do my best to choose the best pieces to use! However, please do not expect a brand new & never been used spoon. 
→ I am always willing to send you photos of flatware handle options. Please know that I do my best to be quick but that sometimes my response times can be up to 24-48 hours as I get MANY emails daily. 
→ All product from the shop is FOOD SAFE and approved for use with your everyday flatware. I recommend HAND WASHING, as silver plate can tarnish faster over time if put in the dishwasher frequently. These are made with care, so please wash with care. 
{{ Details on Production and Shipping Times }}
→ Production times vary and I always have them updated in my POLICIES TAB. Around holidays, the shop does get busy and production can take up to 14 days. Production is normally anywhere from 7 to 14 days. I offer Rush production for a 10 fee if you need something out immediately - please contact me for a custom listing.
→ Shipping is set to first class on default. If you would like to upgrade you can do so at checkout, but PLEASE be aware that the shipping speed DOES NOT change the production time. Contact me if you need a faster production time. 
→ For US orders, First Class normally takes around 3 to 7 days and Priority is around 2 to 3 days. For International orders First Class normally takes anywhere from 7 to 21 days depending on your location and customs. Please also be aware you may be responsible for customs fees and duties depending on your country. 
→ Tracking is included with EVERY order. Please check your online receipt to see where your package is during its transit to you. Most countries also update tracking, but once it leaves the US there will be no updates until it reaches your country. 
■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ 
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your order! I take GREAT PRIDE in making quality product and my intention is to please you 100%. If you have any questions, please ask. Communication is key to a happy experience and I strive to take good care of my customers!

You will also need around 1 kg (2.2 lbs) to make a big chunky scarf.
Please remember that the size of the blanket will also depend on a chosen pattern and knitting style. Don't tighten the yarn too much while knitting it will only harden the blanket and make it much smaller. Your blanket will be nice and soft in touch if you knit your stitches loosely. Don't be afraid to use your arms - arm knitting is FUN :)!   
If you want to make a blanket in different size then those stated above and need some help calculating how much chunky yarn you should purchase, please contact us - we don't bite and we'll be happy to help :)!
WASHING
Remember to dry clean only. Please use professional dry-cleaner.

15754,RINGO: 6-Pack of the First Completely Invisible Ring Sizer with Memory Material for the Perfect Fit on Your Finger Every Time,"
            Ringo is a first of its kind ring sizer. Its design makes Ringo virtually invisible, and the memory material Ringo is comprised of makes it vastly more comfortable than metal or hard plastic alternatives. It will perfectly fit to your finger the first time you put it on, and it will continue shaping itself to you as your finger changes size with the seasons. 
Don't spend hundreds of dollars getting your precious ring resized only to have it not fit again in a few months time! Ringo is the easy fix to make any ring fit perfectly, and do so completely unnoticed. Other ring sizers are obviously seen and take away some of the natural beauty of your ring. Don't let this happen to you! Use Ringo to make sure your jewelry doesn't lose any of its luster, no matter the size. 
Ringo is also easy to clean; just wipe it off with a dry cloth to remove any excess oil or dirt. Its slim and simple design does not allow for dirt to collect in any crevices that tarnish your rings. Other ring sizers also need to be applied before you put your ring on, making it a difficult application process. Ringo will easily slide right under your ring after you put it over your knuckle, making it a quick and painless process. 
Each Ringo pack comes with six ring sizers, two small, medium, and large - now any sized ring will fit perfectly (for thicker and thinner rings). Add Ringo to your cart today and start wearing your oversized rings with the confidence and comfort you deserve!

My model has on a 40"" in length, please follow instructions below to determine the length you will need.
SIZING SUGGESTIONS:
This necklace is a wrap necklace with no clasp. Since everyone's head, neck and body size are different, this is important to use a piece of string to make sure the necklace can be worn comfortably and that it will fit over your head twice to create the looks shown.

            Turquoise 108 Bead Mala Beads
Gorgeous blue-green turquoise magnesite beads are hand knotted by me into this traditional 108 bead mala or Buddhist prayer beads.  The bright red knotting thread and handmade tassel contrast perfectly.
Along with the 108 bead mala, I also offer shorter lengths though they will have less than 108 beads. See additional sizing information below.
Matierials:
8mm turquoise magnesite beads.
Knotting thread.
Cotton hand tied tassel.
Size info:
108 bead mala plus guru bead measures 42"" in circumference and will hang below the navel when worn around the neck.  (see last photo above)
If you would like a shorter necklace (that will not have 108 beads) you can also order these sizes:
26"" which will hang to the mid chest.
30"" which will hang to about solar plexus level.
36"" hangs to about the belly button.
42"" 108 bead mala which will hang below the navel and can also be doubled around the neck.
See last image above for a chart.  This is an estimate only and length could be longer or shorter depending on the size of the person.

19007,Felted wool slippers/Handmade/Slippers/Wool slippers/Women slippers/felt shoe/women shoe/home shoe/wool shoe,"
            Felted wool slippers. Handmade. I used very soft Natural Australian Merino wool.
 
The slippers can be made in any size and color.
Usually it takes 7-10 working days to make it and 2-5 days to ship.
Slippers will let your feet skin breathe. 
Warm feeling on a cold day and cool on a hot day.  I don't make them with a rubber bottom because it makes the shoe heavier especially for older people. I use special material in between the felting that will make the bottom of the shoe waterproof and not slippery. It will be more comfortable and usable for daily wear. 
Care:
gently hand wash at 30- 40C (90F). Use mild detergents, reshape with hands or on your feet while damp and leave to dry. Never put any felted item in a dryer.
Thank you for visiting my shop!

19027,Women's Sherpa Slippers - Women's Slippers with Soles - Soft Sole Shoes Women - Chestnut,"
            These women's sherpa slippers feature sherpa suede fabric that will keep you warm and comfortable when your house is cold! I made these women's slippers with soles - vinyl comes standard - to add durability and make them less slick on hard surfaces. If you're looking for a near-barefoot, soft sole feel, these slippers are perfect for you! Did I mention they're washable? 
FEATURES:
-   Made from a man-made material that looks like suede on the outside and lambs wool on the inside - it's so soft and comfy!
-   Soft sole has an extra layer to help keep your feet warm when it's cold.
-   The material is breathable so your feet stay warm without getting too hot.
-   Have these made just the way you want! I offer a neoprene or a suede sole upgrade. Both are slip-resistant like the vinyl. Neoprene adds a little more of a buffer between your feet and hot or cold surfaces. Neoprene resists water while suede does not. Both sole upgrades extend the life of your slippers.
-   These come in women's whole sizes. Please order up to the next size if you wear a half size (if you wear a 7.5, order up to an 8).
HOW TO ORDER:
1.   Select the quantity you'd like
2.   Select your sole material
3.   Select your size (if you need a wide or narrow slipper, I can do that! Just let me know in your notes at checkout)
4.   Click ""Add to Cart""
5.   Is this a gift? Great! Add in the notes field what you'd like me to write in a gift note

19203,"Gold Armlet, Arm Band, Boho Jewelry in 14kt Gold Filled, Sterling Silver, Gold Coin Tattoo, Gold Tattoo","
            A super stylish piece, this dainty arm band makes any outfit. Wear it with a simple tank and it will instantly uplift the entire look. 
FULL DESCRIPTION:
- This listing is for the Dainty Coin Armlet shown in Photo 1.
- The circle coins are roughly 4mm.
- Comes with 1"" adjustable extender.
- Made in the USA and quality pieces.
- Available in both 14kt Gold-filled or Sterling Silver.
- Please see production and shipping time below.
---------------------------------
LENGTHS:
The Armlet comes with a 1"" adjustable extender to allow some adjustment.
IMPORTANT****
1. Wrap a string around the arm where you would like the band to sit and mark the length.
2. Measure the string to the mark using a ruler.
3. Select the appropriate length in the drop down menu.
Example: If your arm size is roughly 10"", select 10""-11"". The Armlet would measure to 10"" with 1"" adjustable fit.
---------------------------------
MATERIALS
GOLD-FILLED JEWELRY:
- Under normal wearing conditions and with proper care, your gold filled jewelry should last at least 10 years.
- 14kt Gold-Filled jewelry is made by bonding a solid layer of 14kt gold on top of another metal, but this layer is 1000 - 10,000 times thicker than gold plating, resulting in a durable, long-lasting product that looks gorgeous like solid gold.
- Gold-Filled jewelry can also be worn by people with sensitive skin.
STERLING SILVER:
- We use .925 Sterling Silver, which requires polishing from time to time from oxidation. You can easily restore silver back to shine with a polishing cloth or use a polishing lotion for that extra shine.

19677,90s KIDS SUPER RARE Buffalo Platform Suede Leather Childrens Shoes size eu 31/ us 12.5 Made in Spain,"
            These are a super rare find by the brand Buffalo in a children's size 12-12.5. I bought them hoping they would fit my 8 inch feet (I wear a size 13-1) and they do but they're much too tight to walk comfortably in. These shoes were made in Spain circa the 1990s out of genuine leather and a man made sole. The platform is about 1.5 inches high and is suitable for both boys and girls.  Once again these are one of a kind children's shoes and will not fit your adult feet.        ",150.00,4.7778,"Vintage item

20419,Hammered Copper Belt Buckle by Fosterweld,"
            We beat this buckle into submission before handing it off to you. A piece of solid copper receives over 300 blows with a hammer, then is welded by hand into a wearable piece of art. This buckle comes with no protective coating, so let nature do its thing over time. This rounded rectangle measures 3.5 x 2.5 inches, and will fit on any snap belt.

20426,"Festival pocket belt bag ~ vegan canvas utility belt with pockets ~ steampunk brass brown, black or purple canvas ~ men or women ~ cosplay","
            Festival belt bag utility belt with pockets. Brown, black or purple plum vegan canvas. Brass hardware. Adjustable and unisex
I've shifted some details on this classic belt design to help accommodate our ever expanding phones. 
~ Four outside pockets and two flat secret pockets on the backside.
All 6 pockets are topped with zippers.
Larger outside pockets measure 6"" wide x 3"" deep with a 1"" gusset on the side. Fits my Samsung Galaxy 2 nicely.
Smaller pockets measure 4"" x 3"" w/ 1"" side gusset. (credit card sized.)
Secret pockets un-zip to 6.5"" wide (slightly wider inside) with 3 1/4"" depth.
I can wedge my checkbook into the the inside pocket - so if your phone is smaller than a checkbook this pocket should work nicely.
~ Length adjusts from 34"" to 42"" with 10 size settings to choose from.
Please think in terms of your hip measurement more than your waist size. If you'd like to go longer please request a complimentary extension strap in the ""note to seller"". Extension can go up to 56"" or more. If you know your hip measurement i can send it already adjusted to near your size.
Front has brass ring closure and snap tabs fasten underneath for a smooth finish. 
For smaller sizes see the 3 pocket version designed just for you:
www.etsy.com/listing/470488260/small-petite-steampunk-utility-belt-bag?ref=shop_home_active_1
 
~ Center back has a snapping tab with removable brass ring. Perfect for attaching a tail or other fun festy bits. This belt is flatteringly contoured to curve over your butt and flanks. Does a great job of being unisex. The brown canvas is pleasantly weathered for steampunk flair. There's something about this design that ages gracefully - you can really thrash it at shows for a decade and any wear just adds authenticity, like good denims.
~ Soft strong brushed cotton canvas has a suede like quality. All hardware is a mellow antiqued brass - beautifully steampunk compatible.
COLORS
Current purple plum color is deeper, and darker than what's shown, more of a midnight blue plum.
Brown is a perfect neutral tone.
Black is black.

            Handmade Full Grain Leather Belt. This isn't the ""Genuine Leather"" stuff you find in the department stores. The belt was cut right from the hide and hand dyed. Made to get better with age. Made to last a lifetime.
This leather belt is 1.5"" wide. Hand dyed brown then sealed with Beeswax. This is a natural product so the dye is accepted differently on every piece so there my be a slight difference in tone.  I don't shy away from scars,range marks, or brands marks. This makes your belt unique. NO TWO BELTS WILL EVER BE THE SAME! The holes are spaced 3/4"" apart with 9 in all for a better fit.The buckle is held on with Chicago Screws making it easy to replace with your own. 
 Sizing:
Find your waist size and add 4 inches and that is your belt size. For example if you are a  36"" waist you would wear a 40"" belt.  If you would like to measure an old belt that fits just right. Just measure the belt from the end of the buckle to the hole you use the most. Then simply pick the closest size from the drop down list.        ",35.00,4.8043,"Handmade item
