One of the most sought after of designs, the new air age spawned a variety of different desk models and ornamental aeroplanes in a variety of different materials.
This silver toned model is extremely heavy and features the trademark angled plane design giving its the impression of being inflight mounted on a beautiful organic base.
The model is in wonderful condition however the original propellers have unfortunately not survived.
The aeroplane measures :
18cm Wide
23cm Deep

            Vintage Swartzbaugh Manufacturing Co. EVERHOT #760 Art Deco Wind-Up Clock Appliance Timer.
This is a COOL piece.  It is a wind up clock, but is also the antique equivalent to a modern day on-off timer. You set the on/off time and you have a 1920's timer to turn power off and on for whatever you have plugged into it. 
Great Art Deco design, pressed steel case, made by Swatzbaugh MFg, the case swivels on its base and measures 5 by 5 by 2 inches. 
The clock works great, and the on/off function also works as it should.  Clock is in good shape.  Case has paint wear and scratches - great period correct patina (See pictures).  
Get a an old art deco clock with an on/off timer that is 80 to 90 years old for a great price!

About Bamboo
Bamboo! We all know this wood. It's light weight, super strong and beautiful. I actually use bamboo flooring to make these capos. Easy to obtain and work with. It's cheap and very fast to sculpt it into shape hence the lower price for the capo. It's definitely one of my favorites because of it's amber color. I almost gave up on making bamboo capos but then I realized it would be a stupid idea. Hehehe :) But it's definitely a keeper.

******* ATT: All of our 18k gold items need up to 12 business days to make*********
❤ What Are Amorphous Simulated Diamonds?
Through the use of ADT (amorphous diamond technology) technology man-made diamond crystals are infused into simulated crystals to create a diamond top that is made of pure carbon SP3 bonds. This adds a thick layer of organized lattice on the surface of these stones and allows them to convey a look and feel that approximates authentic diamonds. In fact, in their optical and physical properties they are the closest that synthetic diamonds come to natural stones.The upper layer of carbon lends a sparkle to these stones that makes them stand out amongst the other simulated stones.
Our Return Policy:

After 30 days, we accept returns up to 60 days. At this point you are responsible for the shipping cost and a small restocking fee will be applied.

13979,Mind The Gap self striping sock yarn **pre order**,"
            **This listing is to pre-order Mind The Gap. Ready to ship in 5-6 business days.*
""Mind The Gap"" is a colourway inspired by the twelve colours of the iconic London Underground Tube map. 
Weight: 100g 
Metreage: 425m (464 yards) 
Fibre content: 75% British Bluefaced Leicester wool, 25% nylon
This is a self striping sock yarn, which means it will pattern into bold, colourful stripes as you knit. Each stripe will be approximately six rows wide (12mm, half an inch) depending on your gauge and the number of stitches you cast on. The sequence of colours will vary between dye lots, and will not necessarily be in the same order as the sock in the photograph. 
Nimbus is a delightful base for comfortable, durable socks. A light fingering weight, the composition is 75% British superwash Bluefaced Leicester wool, and 25% nylon. With this base, there can occasionally be imperfections in a skein that happen at the mill when the yarn is spun, such as a join or a loose ply.
Aftercare: this is a superwash yarn, which can be machine washed at 30 degrees on a wool cycle. However, I prefer to hand wash my hand knitting, using a gentle wool wash. After laundering, blot excess water with a towel and leave to dry flat.        ",26.20,4.9714,"Handmade Supply

20574,"As Worn by Stevie Nicks Shawl, Black Stevie Nicks Clothing for Fleetwood Mac Concert Outfit Stevie Shawl Women Accessories","
            This shawl is Stevie Nicks approved!!! I am writing this in elated disbelief, on the brink of tears:  I designed this shawl style for a Talenthouse contest to create fashion for Stevie Nicks to wear AND STEVIE PICKED IT TO WIN and WEAR (as shown)!! 
Big thanks to Fleetwood Mac tour photographer Justin Wysong for sharing this first photo of Stevie wearing the shawl during her concert performance of Rhiannon!  Watch a video of Stevie in action with the shawl, plus a super shy me being interviewed: http://fox13now.com/2014/11/23/uniquely-utah-kanab-designer-weaves-web-of-threads-for-rock-legend-stevie-nicks/
COLOR CHOICES:
""NAY-TIV RAY-VIN"" is the 228 contest-winning black option or for 80 less, you can have me make CUSTOM COLORS!  You can see many examples of different color options at 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/CricketsCreations?section_id=6963089
 or let's talk about what you have in mind because I have many yarns just waiting to come to life as a Stevie approved shawl!
Stevie Nicks wrote at https://www.talenthouse.com/i/design-a-shawl-for-stevie-nicks :
""Ultimately, I chose NAY-TIV RAY-VIN by Crickets Meyeres.  I felt this garment could have been made for Rhiannon or for Gold Dust Woman~ the color really isn’t that important. It just seems like a “Celtic” or a “native American” piece~ and I found that very interesting because it is obviously the tribal element that drew me to it~ be it Welsh or Southwestern~ Congratulations!!!""                
And this is what I wrote about this 7 feet long, 3 feet wide shawl, which I made with so much love and admiration for Stevie Nicks, a wonderful person, an animal lover and an amazingly talented artist (I still can't believe that I get to say that I'm a ""Designer for Stevie Nicks!!):
NAY-TIV RAY-VIN: EnFold
I created this shawl especially to fit Stevie. It attracts and evokes the spirit of the raven. Native cultures perceive ravens as secret keepers, facilitators of metamorphosis, bearers of magic, harbingers of autumn and transmitters of messages from the cosmos. 
From my southwestern high desert home, I hand knit this long, rectangular wrap with several soft, sleek, shiny and feathery yarns. Using over 3,200 lacy stitches for this brand new and original piece, I shaped a black, elongated diamond along the entire length, to represent wings. 
The ragged, irregular fringe emulates the outline of a raven in flight and includes black and silver glint because all corvids, including ravens, adore shiny treasures. A bird’s gotta have bling!  
This design floats and drapes beautifully and with a life of its own. 
The body of the shawl itself shifts between transparent and opague in homage to the raven’s ever changing, shape shifting attributes. The raven is both constant and in perpetual transformation. Sounds like someone else whom we know and love, doesn’t it? ;) 
Designing for you, 
Celeste (Crickets) 
 Crickets [!at] CricketsKnits.com ""
*The shawl that you will receive will be nearly identical to the one shown on Stevie (I am likely the only person who can tell any slight differences in yarns).  I will make you a shawl that's the same size, shape, style, etc.!  There is a second, smaller inner diamond in Stevie's original shawl that won't be present in the replicas (due to it being not as durable as the rest of the shawl, it's prone to unraveling or other problems.  You see, the shawl was originally knit to only be worn once during a photo shoot and Stevie has decided to wear it during every concert in the tour.  So I am making the new versions to LAST and last!).        ",148.00,4.9806,"Handmade item
