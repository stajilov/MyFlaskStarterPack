            Lucky Day Price!
I remember having something like this to fly my kite, not quite as fancy as today.
This sealed package of kite twine is brought to us by ""Fly It"" brand.  It states that it has an average test of 45 lbs.   We have 374 ft. or (125 yards).  It's sealed in the original package, which I have to admit looks a little older.  The inside label has some discoloration but, it's very clear.  
This little number originally sold for a whopping .49 cents, wow.  It was made in the U.S.A.

            Vintage French Ladies White Gloves - 1950s - White Jersey Vintage Gloves 
A pretty pair of vintage 1950s white jersey ladies gloves. They are wrist length  with a 'v' shaped slit and cross bar. 
Gloves measure 8 ins from wrist to finger tip and 3 ins across.  They have some stretch to them.
They are in good condition for their age, but there is one small faint yellow stain on the back of the right hand glove. I wonder if the lady spilt a little champagne or white wine on it from her glass back in the day. I've shown it in the last photo.
Tres chic!

5878,Vintage FUR collar w/ tails,"
            An incredibly unique vintage fur piece that could be used several ways. It is actually 2 pieces snapped together. Could be worn as a collar, a belt (if you have a very small waist, or if you attach it to a belt), or you could use the 2 pieces separately around the arms or in your hair. Each piece of mahogany satin measures 11"" long, with 9 tails attached by a beautiful mahogany crocheted wrap. Snaps on both ends. Tails vary slightly in length, but they are approximately 8"". I'm not sure what kind of tails they are, but this is a truly gorgeous, unusual unique piece. I've never seen anything like this before.        ",42.00,5.0,"Vintage item

16742,Oval Druzy Necklace Druzy Pendant Druzy Stone Druzy Jewelry Natural Color Druzy Boho Stone Necklace Gold Edged Druzy Jewelry Quartz Druzy,"
            Gold edged druzy necklace. You can choose which one you'd like to purchase.
Measurements: 
Stone: Number 9 is the largest one overall. It is approximately 1 1/4"" x3/4"" (33mm x 21mm)
Chain: 18"" recommended (choose your length in the product options)
Closure part consists of a clasp, a clasp bar, and a 30mm extender.
   You can choose any chain length, up to 30” without any additional cost for you. Just choose the desirable chain length in the product options.
              
Materials:
Stone: Druzy
Chain: 14K gold plated over brass. Long-lasting, anti tarnish plating. Nickel free.
All elements of this necklace are gold plated, including lobster clasp and jump rings.
              
Product care:
Practice common sense jewelry care. Avoid immersing this item into water. Gold, silver or rhodium plating means applying a layer of precious metal over base metal. The elements of this necklace have been plated with EDT coating technique, which insures high quality of coating. However, plated items are not lifetime purchase, since the layer of precious metal will eventually rub away on some parts of the chain and findings.
