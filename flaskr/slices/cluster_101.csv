3400,"Exquisite, Rare Vintage Native American Geometric Design Beaded Purse Wallet","
            This wallet is exquisite. It is such fine Native American beadwork. I am guessing from the 1950's based on the style of the wallet. Most of the work is done with beautiful cut beads. The edging is done with tiny, tiny beads. Just amazing. The colors are gorgeous!  Museum quality beadwork. Possibly Plains but would love to hear if any expert out there has an idea!!
The are two small areas of loss. I always meant to have it restored but never did. The last photo shows the loss near the clasp. The photo of the back, of the wallet, shows the loss near the bottom of the right side. Even with this loss this piece is still a rare find. A true collectible piece. 
The interior looks like it is faux leather but may be genuine. There is a metal zipper pocket. Moiré-like material lines the inside. 
The wallet measures 7"" x 5"".  Inside the flap area it looks completely unused. The coin area, which opens at the top, shows some use. Slight wear where the hinges are which is to be expected from use and age. Nothing major. It is in wonderful functioning order and could be used if so desired. I always have just had it on display. 
Let me know if you have any questions!  I do consider offers as well!

            Welcome to my Junkgle- It gets better here every day!
You have your eye on this nice Samsonite Faux Leather Travel Bag.
It is from the Silhouette Series, and (fittingly) is a Dark Gray.
It is hoping to find someone to continue its travel with- it is quite the adventurer!.
  
It is 22in x 12in x 7in. With one compartment, which is closed by a jumbo zipper.
it doesn't have a key, but it does have the lock, if it's any consolation.
It is in great functional physical condition, but does have a few cosmetic flaws:  It acquired a streak or two of white and got a couple tears in the edging on its' previous adventures. (see pics)
 The streak may be removable or could be colored over if you choose. The torn pieces are still attached and could be glued in place again.
Besides that it is nearly new. 
This item, like most of the items i have for sale, besides my original creations, came to me as rescues. I do not know their history, but i try to get to know them well before I find them a home. I give them cleanings when necessary and i'm able, but there may be more to touch up depending on the item and/ or your taste.
I try to represent all my items honestly and thoroughly in the photos and descriptions, Please look closely at the photos and consider them an integral part of the description- (i can only type so much:)
That said, there may be some personality traits that i didn't mention  or observe, or was unaware of. so if you have any questions please ask.
If any item you see or receive is not as described, within reason, I assure you it was not intentional. Please contact me and i will do whatever is necessary to make the situation right. 
I want to spread happiness and harmony, not confusion and chaos.        ",29.00,5.0,"Vintage item

            Pack of 20 Vintage Unused US Postage stamps of the:
6 cent American Buffalo Wildlife Conservation Commemorative stamp.
Issued July 20, 1970
Scott catalog #: 1392
From a time when there were millions of them roaming across much of the continent, to a time when their numbers were reduced to two small herds in all of North America, the American buffalo went through bad times after the white man came to this part of the world. They were killed for sport, slaughtered. The efforts of the American Bison Society were instrumental in redirecting the bisons' future. In 1894 the U.S. Department of the Interior prohibited the killing of any more buffalo in Yellowstone National Park. Slowly the herds began to grow. 
You will receive 20 Mint unused postage stamps with original gum as issued by the Post Office. These stamps are genuine and valid to use as postage for current mailing. Be sure to use enough total postage to meet the current postage rate for mailing a letter if you want to use them mailing. 
Also good to use for scrapbooking or displaying in a small picture frame. It's a miniature work of art.

5284,"Antique Botanical Illustration, Beige, Neutral Color Decor, Wildflower Art, Rustic Flower Print, 5"" x 7.75"", Vintage Wall Art,  Dogwood (31)","
            This beautiful illustration, by American botanical artist Marion Satterlee, is of a wildflower called Round-Leaved Dogwood.  It's a black and white illustration that has aged to a lovely buff color.  The opposite side of the page has text.
It is an original illustration that was carefully removed from an antique book published in 1900, not a copy, reproduction or digital download.
Because it is over 100 years old, there are some minor flaws.  There may be some minor foxing, creases or glue along the edges from where it was removed from the book. Any flaws around the border could be easily covered by a mat before framing.  
The print does not come matted or framed.
The approx. size of the page is 5"" x 7.75"" (12.7 cm x 19.685 cm).  It could be easily trimmed down to fit a standard 5"" x 7"" mat or frame.

5784,1920s Ecru Cloche Hat,"
            Vintage 1920s ecru cloche hat, made from a woven stiff synthetic fiber.  It has grosgrain ribbon trim, and a bow on the back.  It has beige silk lining.  In good condition for its age -- the silk lining is shredding in spots, and the hat overall is dingy.  No holes or major stains, just a little foxing from age. It measures 8"" tall from the brim to the top, and the interior circumference is 21"".

6038,Apple Bacon Cheddar Organic Dog Treats,"
            Inspired by a recipe in the human cooking magazine Bon Appetit, we are proud to present our new Apple Bacon Cheddar treats! These treats are a huge hit in our house-- as we were developing the recipe, my dogs loved chowing down on the ""prototypes"". I can't blame them. Who doesn't love bacon?!
PLEASE NOTE: Like homemade human cookies, these cookies are in their ""prime"" for only a few days without refrigeration. BUT, they do freeze and later defrost very well. I recommend that you order as many as you want but only have 2-3 days worth out of the refrigerator/freezer at any one time. 
Ingredients: Organic flour, organic bacon, organic white cheddar cheese, organic unsweetened apple sauce, organic salt, organic eggs.        ",4.99,5.0,"Handmade item

            You can find all my work on: https://www.instagram.com/studio_nin/
After doing the art academy in s'Hertogenbosch I became a painter. I love to paint watercolors of animals they bright my day and hopefully yours too.
If you want me to make a custom pet portrait for you, buy a portrait in the shop and send me a photograph or several pictures of your pet. A good picture is the key to a good painting. Try to make a picture with natural lighting and lots of detail in the face of the pet. Quality of the picture is important here. If you want a portrait with the whole body make sure body parts are visible. If you are not sure. Let me take a look at your pictures. I'll help you to find a picture and a composition that works well in a painting.
I only use high quality materials that are light fast and have the best color pallette. I use Italian Fabriano 300g hot pressed 140lb paper which is acid-free and archival museum rated, Derwent watercolor pencils and Winsor & Newton watercolor paint.
Size 
Paper I use is 8 x 12 inches / a4 (the painting can be cut to 8x 10 for framing)
10 x 10 inches (25x25 cm)or 10x12 inches (25x31 cm )for a surcharge. 
It's also possible to paint two pets on one 10x12 inch paper. Look for prices in check out.
It will usually be ready in 2 or 3 weeks.
Paintings will be lovely packed as a gift for your family and friends, but also as a gift to yourself! They'll bepacked with care in cardboard and a protected envelop.        ",43.00,5.0,"Handmade item

Standard pickups are my PF2 humbuckers.  Electrically similar to a mini humbucker, but with no adjustable pole pieces, and no backplate.  The bobbins are wrapped in copper foil which shields everything and grounds the pole pieces.   Usually they run between 6K and 7K ohms.  Pickups are placed more or less at the guitars center of mass, close to what is normally called the neck position. I also have Bill Lawrence L45S pickups.  Very clear and quiet.  Really excellent quality and still made locally by Bill's family.
Bridges are available in Aluminum or cream colored Corian.  The Aluminum is standard and a little brighter, the Corian a little warmer.
Current standard finish is a gun stock oil varnish with rottensone ground on the more porous woods like Mahogany.  I normally bring the body up to a satin sheen, and the necks have the thinnest possible buildup, giving them a very fast, natural feel..  I can also do a ""Barn Burst"" on the lighter colored woods like poplar and pine, which is painted with milk paint and then sanded back to make it look like old barn wood.  
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.  And again, tons of pictures on Facebook/Weir Guitars.

Dwight: He put my stuff in Jell-O again.

Dwight: That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
Probably one of the most iconic scenes from the entire series. It is Jim's first prank on Dwight that has been replicated by fans again and again worldwide.
