788,Vintage TRIFARI KUNIO MATSUMOTO Necklace Earrings Demi Parure Cabochon Rhinestone Grape Cluster Gorgeous Rare Neiman Marcus,"
            You are viewing a heavily sought after & signed Trifari grape cluster necklace and earring demi parure designed by Kunio Matsumoto. This drop dead demi parure is circa 1970'S. It was originally purchased at Neiman Marcus and has since been stored in the original leatherette pouch as shown. 
I am extremely detailed and want to provide you with as much information as possible. This gorgeous chic, gold plated glass cabochon demi parure is in great vintage condition and has a million miles left. All clasps are in proper working order. There are no bends to the metal findings. There are no missing cabochons or any with cracks or chips. There is a very minimal and unnoticeable wear to the gold plate on some of the connecting areas of the leaves however, again this is not noticeable. This is a fabulous statement set in absolutely fantastic condition! Haute Couture will never go out of fashion! 
***The dress form is a life sized ladies size small to help you in gauging size.***
Approximate Dimensions:
Length of Necklace Chain (hard to measure due to its design): 15""
Length of Extender Chain: 3.5""
Width of Necklace: .50""
Largest Grape Cluster (Necklace): 1.5"" x 1.25""
Length of Earrings: 1 1/8""
Width of Earrings: 7/8""

            Great Mother's Day Gift,I found a lot of these beautiful brooches. They were in a box with some other 1960s jewelry from a shop that had been out of business. 
Can be sold in sets for group gift giving. I can see these as a groomsmen gift or even bridesmaid as a unique one of a kind gift. 
These brooches are very rare.

Perfect Condition, I did not see any defects. For its age it is in great condition.

4369,Authentic Vintage French Leather Briefcase Messenger bag document bag signed Gerard Paris from 1980's in very clean condition,"
            Authentic Vintage French Leather Briefcase Messenger bag document bag signed Gerard Paris from 1980's in very clean condition.
I found this authentic leather brief case document bag at a French Brocante (antiques market) The leather has the most beautiful patina, with leather interior in great condition for its age. Internal zipped pouch compartment, very clean, with only a few marks considering its age, photographed on here, these add to the vintage look. Good working external catch ready for business. Sturdy handle and is suitable as a working bag, a really truly lovely thing. I think this bag must be from around 1970-1980.
Measures: L 38cm x W 38cm x D x 10cm (with the handle) approximately.

I pack every item with great care and I send it within 1-2 working days. If you are sending it as a present I am happy to enclose I card which I can write for you.
If you are ordering from UK, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, I can send by Mondial Relay, which makes the shipping charge cheaper, and is still delivered direct to your home address. If you are ordering from France I also use Mondial Relay, and this becomes very cheap, if you don’t mind collecting from a Point Relais. If you would rather have the item delivered to your home, let me know and I can send via Collissimo which is a higher cost. If you want to purchase several items together, I can recalculate you a better shipping price, where practical, just contact me in advance.
Do not hesitate to ask me for more information, I will be very pleased to help you, and I like to please my customers.

            Look smashing at that fancy thing you have to get dressed up for!
These circuit board cufflinks are fashioned out of an old, broken circuit board. Bits of circuitry were hand cut to fit into small silver plated settings. The circuits are covered in a glass-like layer of resin, which provides a durable yet beautiful finish. The circuit part of each cuff link is 5/8 inches (16cm) across. The tuxedo studs feature round circuit board medallions that are 10 mm (3/8 inches) across and are mounted on nickel studs. 
These will come nicely wrapped as shown in the third listing photo! They work perfect as groomsmen gifts, graduation gifts, father's day gifts, and even the untechnically inclined can appreciate these!
Simpy choose the circuit board color you want as well as the number of shirt studs. Please allow up to seven business days for the creation of your custom circuit board tuxedo set. 
Last photo is for demonstration of size only. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________
All items are shipped in a black cotton-filled gift box for protection and wrapped in bubble wrap. All shipping materials used are recyclable.

13755,VICTORIAN PARASOL Umbrella in Black/Gold Stripe with Black Fringe or Lace Ruffle Bridal Steampunk Second Line Wedding Civil War Edwardian,"
            Offered for sale is this handmade Victorian style parasol in an exquisite black and gold stripe fabric. The black stripe looks like satin and the gold stripe looks like grosgrain ribbon. It is expensive fabric and it looks it. The parasol is finished with your choice of black fringe or a black lace ruffle at the hem and tip.  It has a painted turned wood handle, rib tips and ferrule tip. You may choose to have the new knob handle tip or the plain handle. It is the perfect small size for a Victorian era parasol as it is about 23"" in diameter when open and about 30"" long.  It is finished with a tassel and parasol charm.    
 
This is a MADE TO ORDER item. I am usually two to four weeks out on shipping orders. If you have a rush order, contact me and I will tell you whether I will be able to meet your deadline. I do offer International shipping. 
In addition to my small Victorian size parasols at about 23"" in diameter when open, I offer custom orders for larger size parasols, a 29” diameter, a 32” diameter and a 20” child size parasol. Victorian parasols are traditionally small in diameter but after many requests for larger parasols I will now make up any of my parasol styles in the new sizes by request. Convo me for a custom order. 
This parasol frame is very sturdy as it has a metal shaft.  Many parasols offered are made on inexpensive wood shafts that are easily broken and have an unreliable opening mechanism.  This metal handle also locks both open and closed for easy use and carrying.  
   Keep in mind that this is a parasol and not a rain umbrella.  It may be used as a sun shade and to add a lovely accent to your ensemble, but don't get it wet.  If it gets wet it will probably be damaged, and I cannot attest to the colorfastness of  any of the products used in it's creation.  
    
   This parasol will be a stunning accessory for a Victorian or Old West costume or beautiful as part of your costume.  If you are a parasol collector, this will be a lovely addition to your collection.        ",57.00,4.9091,"Handmade item

  Avoid using your piece on the beach because the contact with salted water and sand, certainly will scratch them. Besides the fact that salted water has a high oxidising power, which leads to darkening.
  Put on perfume or hair spray a few minutes before wearing you jewellery, to evaporate the excess.
  Avoid contact with cleaning products, products for personal hygiene, cosmetics and chemicals in general, they can damage the piece.
  Never clean or polish any item with supplies like metal brushes, steel wool or abrasive cloths, as they will scratch the surface of the piece.        ",39.80,4.95,"Handmade item

18835,Custom Painted Hi Top Beauty and the Beast Disney Shoes,"
            Take away these beautiful shoes and really feel like the belle of the ball! 
For shoe size conversions please use this guide: http://www.clarks.co.uk/help/fitguide
All shoes are hand painted with detail and precision, so please be patient when ordering. Times can jump from around 2 weeks to 6 weeks, however we will endeavour to keep that time as short as possible with updates on your order.
The paint used is Acrylic paint, which when dry becomes naturally elastic and water resistant, giving it bold, bright colour for months, as well as flexibility and durability when walking. We also spray our shoes with water resistant spray, to give them an extra helping hand to keep your shoes looking at their best. Cleaning requires a soft sponge, rubbed gently over the image. The paint will not run, so they are more then suitable in the rain!
All shoes are customisable, so if you'd like a different colour background, or a name added, please feel free to say when ordering. All name personalisations are free!
