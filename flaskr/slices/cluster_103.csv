165,"Rare Steiff Monkey, Vintage 'Mungo' Steiff Monkey, Small Mohair Monkey, 1950s 1960s Original Steiff Collectable, Vintage Stuffed Toy Animal","
            Rare Steiff monkey 'Mungo' (1950s/1960s). Vintage mohair Steiff toy animal.
This gorgeous vintage Steiff monkey is utterly charming. He's looking for a very loving home.
As you will see from the photos, this gorgeous little monkey has clearly been well-loved. The many cuddles he must have received over the years have worn away some of his mohair fur in places, but these imperfections simply add to his charm.
This classic Steiff toy is made from straw-filled mohair. He has a hard-stuffed body and tail. 
Considering his ripe old age, this little monkey is relatively good condition but he does have some flaws (this is reflected in the price):
- Steiff button and flag are missing from ear
- card chest tag is missing
- furry mane around his face are discoloured and worn in places
- mohair fur of body and tail is worn in a few places
- visible loose threads on right hand, foot and leg (I've left these as is in case the new owner wishes to repair these and do a thread colour match)
- red neck collar is frayed and in poor state of repair
Made in Germany
Brand: Steiff
Material: mohair, straw filling, glass eyes, plastic and metal collar
Measurements: 5"" tall when seated
Condition: good (see shop Policies page). 
This beautiful little monkey would make such a special Christmas gift for any vintage toy collector.
If you have any questions please feel free to contact me :)
Thanks so much for looking!

1958,Vintage Polished Steel Seiko Ship's Clock,"
            We usually source vintage double-sided ships' clocks (as a sideline from our vintage maritime lighting), which are extremely popular. Now, for the smaller budget, we have tracked down these vintage gems.
These are original Seiko ships' clocks which would have been used on board vessels at sea, with all the heritage and backstory that goes with that - as well as looking incredible. Originally painted light blue-green (we have kept a few with this original paint - see our other listings - as it has a very distinct vintage feel), this version has been stripped of paint and the steel polished.
Originally run off the ship's electrical system, which is incompatible with domestic systems, we have had the electrics removed and the mechanism replaced with an extremely reliable battery version.

2332,Antique Turkmen Turkoman Ersari Tribal Silver Bracelet/ Cuff TJ 2,"
            I bought this antique bracelet/ cuff on one of my travels
in Afghanistan in 1978. 
It still has my original buying tag on it:
3rd visit to Afghanistan in 1978 - purchase number 11
It was originally worn in the early 20th Century by a Turkmen woman of the Ersari tribe
in the Aqcha Region of Central Asia - probably in a pair
made of high grade silver
beautiful chasing (engraving) work
unusual because of its double claws ( one big pair and one smaller pair) on the back to hold it on the wrist
excellent condition
a great addition in any collection
measurements:
9.5 cm high 
diameter 6 x 4.5 cm one end
diameter 6.5 x 4.5 cm other end
opening 2.8 cm
weight 139 g

            This German handmade brown leather bag is drop-dead GORGEOUS.  The top German leather quality is stunning and the satchel shape adds to its exquisite elegance. 
The bag can be used as a shoulder bag or top handle bag. The interior of the bag is very clean with the exposed leather. There is one zipper pocket inside the bag. The bag closes with the front buckle. 
The bag is in very good vintage condition although there is a dark marking on the bag as a result of the leaning buckle. this dark marking is thus hidden by the leaning buckle in the front. Please remember that vintage items have been previously loved- it is common for pieces to show some normal signs of age & wear.

            Vintage brown briefcase with clasps. This brown attache case can be used as a large (15 inch or 14 inch) laptop / notebook bag (max 15,6 inch). It could be a perfect lawyer gift or nerd briefcase. It's made of imitation leather - very popular material in soviet era because of lack of genuine leather in industry. It's original soviet era product!
 It's very solid, can be used to cary a lot of books, heavy notebook etc. 
(There is a lock in each clasp, but the key isn't needed to open the case and unfortunately I don't own the key)
The briefcase is in a great condition (looks like new, the only scratch is shown in the picture), very gently used. Looks awesome!

5183,"Set of 2 Antique French Thread Double Spool Dispensers ""Le Fil Au Chinois"", Lithographed Tin Boxes, Polychrome, Collector item, France, 1920","
            Here is a Set of 2 Antique French Thread Double Spool Dispensers from the legendary French wire brand ""Le fil au Chinois"", famous in France and Europe until the beginning of the 20th century.
 This name of ""Fil au Chinois"" comes from a French era not so distant, in full mode of Orientalism. This popularity was provoked by the expeditions to Egypt in 1798 by Bonaparte, the conquest of Algeria by France (1830), the opening of China and Japan (1855). The birth of the Au Chinois brand is exactly part of this cultural movement and the idea was judicious because it allowed the creation of a person easily identifiable since it became an instant classic among collectors.
Whether to complete your collection or to revive them by using them again; They will surely maintain the passion in the heart all lovers of sewing!

5654,Resistol Hat Box - Black with Red Trim and Belt - Storage - Gift Box - Vintage 1950s,"
            This vintage Resistol Hat Box is from around the 1950s.  The hat that once belonged in it is long gone, but the box is still here! 
If you have a Resistol hat and are looking to complete your collection this box is what you need!  You could also use this box to store your fedoras, or it could be used as a vintage gift box, the possibilities are endless!
The box is made from cardboard and is 14.25 inches long, 13 inches wide, and 6.5 inches tall.  
All of the original pieces of the box are here, including the faux leather strap that keeps the lid on the box and the original cardboard insert that held the hat in the hat box.
The box is still in great condition.  The corners and edges show wear, and a few of the corners have been pushed in over time.  One of the corners has a crease on the front, which is shown in a picture.  There is a small tear on the inside cardboard hat holder and on one of the corners of the top lid of the box.  The bottom has a few small stains, some of which are pictured.  There are other various marks and scuffs on the outside of the box, but overall it still looks great!
*********************************************************
This box comes from a smoke free home and has been in storage for many years. If you would like to see more pictures or have any questions, please convo me for details.        ",35.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1950s

6034,"Wooden Dog food stand, customizable dog food stand, elevated dog feeding stand, dog feeding stand, dog feeder, dog food, pet food, dog gift","
            Did you get a puppy for Christmas?  Do you have an older dog who needs some extra TLC?  Every dog owner needs a Buddy Bench aka a wooden dog food stand!   Makes the perfect dog gift!
This all began because of our own dog Buddy, an 8 year old Beagle. One day he was being a little too excited jumping up and down and actually ended up getting a sore neck.  The vet told us to have him take it easy and to elevate his food and water bowls.  We immediately went to the pet store to look for elevated dog feeding stands......they were expensive! And mostly made of plastic.  We realized that we could make our own customizable dog food stand out of wood that would not only be more beautiful, but also durable.  This led to building our very first Buddy Bench, a wooden dog feeding stand!
After more research we found out that ALL dogs would benefit from elevated dog food bowl stands.  It aids in digestion and helps prevent neck injuries.  We started building benches to accommodate all sizes of dogs, from the tiny to the large, from 6"" tall to 18"" tall.  We can even make them bigger if you have a super large breed.
Along with promoting good health we found that our benches solve another problem...dogs knocking their bowls over and pushing them around the house!  With our Buddy Bench, the beautiful stainless steel bowls are fitted inside the bench which prevents your dog from making a mess or knocking them around when empty.  Plus the bowls are super cute with their paw print design.  They come in 3 sizes, 24oz, 2qt, and 3qt depending on the size of your dog and their eating habits. 
It's not only dogs that can benefit from a Buddy Bench!  If you have a feline friend or other pet we can easily accommodate their needs as well.
Choose your height and choose your bowl size, and your pet food stand will be customized for your pet. 
Check out our other style of the Buddy Bench!

9199,Precision Machined Spinning Top,"
            The top, a time honored classic children's toy, with a precision machining twist. These built to order tops are precision machined using the latest in CNC manufacturing from your choice of materials. Each top is hand crafted in my shop, hand finished and hand tested/inspected before leaving for its new home. I am offering these in a multitude of different material types, each material has different looks and weights. 
Being precision machined, these tops have an incredible spin time, on average you can expect an aluminum top to spin for 1-2 minutes; although in testing in the shop I have seen them go for 5 minutes on the right surface. 
We are now also going to be offering a ""Heat Anodized"" finish to all materials with the exception of aluminum. This finish is created by heating the object with a torch to bring out an oxidation layer on the metal. The result is a colorful and unique finish, especially in Copper and Stainless Steel. When choosing this finish please keep in mind that the resulting finish and coloration will be unique to each top.
While tops are typically considered a children's' toy, we have found that these tops are wonderful for stress relief, entertainment and a great fidget tool for your desk! Whatever the purpose you can be assured that our precision solid metal tops will not disappoint. All prices include shipping and handling within the continental United States.

15298,Titanfall 2 Smart Pistol - Model for 3D Printing,"
            A model of the Smart Pistol from Titanfall 2.
Certain aspects of the pistol (mainly the optical lenses and the screw heads) have been left unmodeled due to the difficulty of printing parts of that detail. Ideally, you will provide these details after printing. (Suggested lenses: 1x 7mm lens, 1x 10mm lens, 4x 7.5 or 8mm lenses). The magazine is designed to be held in place with two 5x2mm neodymium magnets.
Designed in Fusion 360 with 3D printing in mind. Multiple individual components, however certain components will require additional splitting to fit in a normal 3D printer (this was not done by me, as there are a wide range of printers on the market). 
Scaled at 314mm long, 201mm tall, and 70mmwide.

15366,"Papercraft Cats, Couple of Cats (2 PDF patterns), Paper Sculptures DIY, Low Polygon, Lowpoly Cats, DIY 3D Papercraft, First Anniversary Gift","
            Hello cat lover! This listing is a set of 2 digital templates you can download, print, cut, and put together using scissors (or craft knife) and white glue.
After several hours... Tadaaaaaaaaa! You get a cute pair of cats you will be so proud of!
These two files are bundled up to make you save 25% on the regular price.
Here is Gus, the standing cat: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/478105146
Here is Genevieve, the one climbing down the wall: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/477374714
************************************
Gus and Gevenieve are siblings that used to squabble all the time over their mother's attention. Now look at them, they are inseparable. Seems like squabbles make bonds stronger.
************************************
TECHNICALITIES
Total Height: 82cm/32in
Total Width: 10cm/4in
Total Depth: 38cm/15in
Total number of parts: 37  56 = 93 parts.
Bicolored models as usual, so each file is divided into 2 to make it easier for you to print: for each cat, one file for the body, and one file for eyes and ears.
************************************
LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY
3/5 (due to tiny parts)
The templates are pretty intuitive but if you have never made a paper sculpture before, each step of the illustrated instructions will suggest you where to start glueing the next part.
Plus the enclosed tips and tricks will help you make flawless sculptures easily.
************************************
ESTIMATED TIME
Allow one afternoon for the half cat to complete.
The standing cat may take up to a day, depending on your glue, number of breaks you need and how much of a perfectionist you are.
************************************
ABOUT GUS, THE STANDING CAT
Gus stands on his tail and back paws but needs to be pinned to the wall (there is a hole in his right front paw to do so). The enclosed instructions indicate where exactly to pin the pin on the wall.
He won't collapse if you use a 180-200 gsm paper (65-80 lbs) and above.
Caution: Much thicker paper will make the tiny parts much difficult to fold.
The common problem encountered when closing a paper sculpture has been solved with a simple solution my beta testers were grateful for :)
************************************
ABOUT GENEVIEVE, THE CAT CLIMBING DOWN
Hang it on the wall like a picture frame thanks to the triangular hole at the back.
160 gsm paper (65 lbs) is enough, but you can chose a heavier card stock.
 
************************************
This is an excellent exercice in patience, focus and mindfulness to free yourself from daily stress. But you already know that, right?

The Bravo Living Probiotic packs described above are a refill for the ""Gift of Health"" Gift Set or it can be used on its own.  When you first take Bravo, you are only taking a little bit like a 1/2 teaspoon 2 times per day.  You won't need much.  Later you take more.  For example 4-8 Tablespoons once you have worked up to it.  The Bravo cultured yogurt stays fresh for a few weeks.  We use the Miron ""charging"" glass.  It extends it to 4 weeks. Make your 3 batches in your own time to stay fresh.  Each batch uses milk as described above.  The directions on the website pretty much all say a liter or 4 cups.  So pay attention to the directions that the info to match what you are buying for the quantity of milk.  The rest is the same.
  
Jars and other items in the gift basket are available at www.bravocoop.com

This 8 panel Cotton Jersey long skirt has a super sensual feel. The weight and volume of fabric swishing against your legs as you walk is wonderfully luxurious.
The smooth fitted hipline basque band has cotton lace detail and fastens with a zip at the back.  On the sides of the band the loop and lace detail is not only a beautiful feature but allows for adjustment so that it will fit perfectly to you.  
The lower hem has a fine cotton lace ruffle trim, a small detail that complements the lace on the hip band and the simple, classic cut.  
This is a must for all of those that enjoy the sleek, sensual beauty of long skirts.  Its a simple classic that fits any wardrobe and adds a little faery magic to my Festival clothing. 
As always, feminine, funky and fair trade.

There may be slight differences in colour variation from your computer to the item.  All pictures are taken in natural light.  There may be slight differences in measurements.  I try to portray the colours as accurately as I can.
I am happy to post worldwide. 
I definitely recommend spot cleaning or gentle/hand wash only in cold water, even if some items are made with 100% acrylic yarn and supposedly machine washable.  A gentle wash in cold water protects the yarn from getting “fuzzed-up” and will help the item stay gorgeous and soft for a long time.  Please lay flat to dry in the shade.
