1284,Vintage Baume & Mercier Chronograph Watch,"
            Baume & Mercier has been one of the world's finest watchmakers since 1830!  From my research, this Swiss beauty was created in the late 40's-early 50's.  All functions work well, and the watch keeps good time.  I had it serviced a few years ago, and it has been in my collection for many years. The dial is original and in great shape, never having been re-finished. The crystal is also in really good condition, no cracks or visible scratches.  The case is nickel chromium-plated steel, and very small at only about 33 mm. diameter, and shows wear in the form of scratches and wear spots, but overall very presentable.  The case back is stainless steel, engine-turned on the inside , and in very good condition.
     The st. steel stretch band goes well with the watch, and kind of accentuates the techno-industrial feel.  A leather band could also be fitted if desired.  
     This is a HIGHLY collectable watch, and is constantly increasing in value , mostly due to its pedigree and, of course, the fact that it is a chronograph. 
 It has always been a favorite in my collection.
The wrist photo makes the watch appear larger than it really is.        ","1,375.00",4.9613,"Vintage item from the 1950s

1295,1960s Patek Philippe Tiffany Pink Gold Manuel Wind Watch,"
            1960s Vintage Patek Philippe for Tiffany Pink Gold Manuel Wind Watch
Luxurious Simplicity.  Classic Elegance. It is hard to go wrong with a Patek Philippe who has built it's reputation on uncompromising quality and the epitome of old world luxury.   This is the watch equivalent of a beautifully tailored suit or an impeccibly fitted couture gown with any of the fussy details.  This is refined restraint in it's most beautiful form--an art of which Patek is the undisputed master.  Retailed by the famed Tiffany and Company, this watch, has the rare dual marks for both Patek and Tiffany on the dial: two greats in one.
 
Patek Philippe has been, for 175 years the name that connoisseurs in the watch industry have aspired to.  The understated elegance and refined attention to detail is of a level that few watch companies can hope to reach.   Patek Philippe's ads often stress ""you don't own a Patek, you hold it for he next generation"".  Such has been the trademark of this watch from the start.   Time and time again, Patek Philipppe watches hold their own, setting records on the auction circuit in retaining value.  
Movement: High grade 18 jewel Swiss caliber Calibre 23-300 Movement is a manual wind movement signed  Patek Phillipe & Co and Geneve on the bridge.  It has been newly serviced by a master watchmaker. It runs and keeps time in good order.
((((Dial condition and detail: Palest silvery-cream dial is original. Beautiful  Gold raised markers are raised arabic numerals at the 3, 6,9, and 12 o'clock positions,  and elongated pyramid shaped at the 1,2,4,5,7,8,10 and 11 o'clock positions.  Painted black minute track and gold leaf shaped hands complete the classic look.
Case condition and detail: Solid 18K pink gold case signed inside the caseback: Patek Philippe and Co. , Geneve Swiss; 18K 750 2629466 ; 3430.  in very good vintage condition.
Crystal/Glass condition: Glass crystal in excellent condition.
Strap condition and detail: New navy leather strap made in France by the french brand ZRC.  Fitted with a generic (not Patek) buckle.
Size of watch: about 26mm x 26mm not including lugs, or crown.
Strap width: 18mm
Will fit wrist size: 6 1/2"" to 7 1/2"" in circumference. 
General Comments: A great classic watch suitable for a man, or a woman who prefers a larger watch. Ready to wear.

2473,1970'S French Bell Bottom Jeans / Vintage Denim Bell Bottoms,"
            These were bought in Paris in 1974, in a little boutique either on the  the Blvd. Saint- Michel or St. Germain. They definitely have a European look to them, especially a French look. I just love those sexy little side zippers. I was living abroad at the time in Amsterdam, and would take weekend trips with a friend to Paris and shop all the great little boutiques that were all over the place in the 70's. These were one of my finds, and I just loved wearing them to the clubs and dancing all night long in them. They are in very good vintage condition, 3 slight what looks to be a bleached- out areas.   Vintage size 8-10. 100% pure cotton denim with no stretch in the fabric. These jeans are a garment made in the 1970's when there was no stretch in the fabric content. This item is sold 'as is'

Moissanite is the perfect diamond alternative, beautiful shiny stone, full of luster and brilliance. With brilliance and fire that outshines even diamonds. Today it is a the most popular alternative to diamonds. Moissanite is rated as a 9.25, which is a great score that is higher than any gemstone used in jewelry besides diamonds. Unlike diamonds, which are carbon, Moissanites are silicon carbide (SiC), a very rare, naturally occurring mineral found primarily in meteors. We use only Charles & Colvard moissanite.
This engagement ring is delicate and with nice presence on the finger.
