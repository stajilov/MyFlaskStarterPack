5661,Wide brimmed fedora for men.  Hat for spring. Barbisio. Waterproof hat - Dark green,"
            Hats can be stylish accessories, but also useful items. Achieving that combination is a great challenge for any hat. This original green fur felt Barbisio hat does it best to achieve that, and it does it very well. It is an ""Impermeabile"" hat (water&rainproof), but no doubt that also shows a great character, especially for its wide brim. 
It is an hat from the 1980s, when the main Italian hats-producers (Borsalino, Panizza, Barbisio) competed with one another and often they copied the models produced by the other brands. Most of the time with similar qualities. Brand was making the difference.
It has a pinched center dent, trimmed with gros-grain band and a fully lined whipped leather. Crown is 37 CM (14,56 IN), brim is 6,2 CM (2,44 IN) and band of 3 CM (1,18 IN).
The hat is in excellent conditions and never used (kept in stock for more than 20 years).
Please just contact and we will be very happy to answer any questions and send you more detailed photos of the hat.

BRAND:
The Barbisio factory was founded in 1862 in Sagliano Micca, near Biella, in the North of Italy. After few decades the Cappellificio Barbisio started exporting its hats all around the world to Africa and the Americas. Due also to the “hat-crisis”, in 1981 the original factory closed and its trademark and production was bought by Cappellificio Cervo, which also owned the Bantam trademark. The Sagliano Micca trademark stamped inside the hat is a reminder of the production before the original factory closed in 1981.

ALL Screw and nail holes filled with stainable or paintable wood filler and entire set sanded and ready for paint or stain.
I will not be the cheapest out there, but I can PROMISE you the few dollars more will give you a higher Quality product.
My boards are also not nailed together with an air nailer for faster production, which loosen and can be pulled out over time.  For the frame I pre drill and use Exterior screws which never can be pulled out.  For the face I HAND nail panel RING SHANK nails which have to be cut because they will never come out of the wood.  I also use carriage bolts with wing nuts.  Small details for a stronger longer lasting board,
