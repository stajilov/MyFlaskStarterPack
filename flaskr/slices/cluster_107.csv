1344,Kenner's Super Spirograph No. 2400  extras; 1969; Classic kids toy to draw interesting designs; Missing only 2 small end pieces,"
            This is a vintage Super Spirograph No. 2400.  It's a classic toy for kids and adults.  ""No limit to the different designs you can make.  Does everything Spirograph does...PLUS!""
This Super Spirograph includes:  box base and lid, red tray, instruction booklet, a 1967 instruction booklet, L Super Square, all the pieces in the tray except for 2 of the end pieces, and drawing baseboard.  There are over 2 dozen green pins.  See photos.  Additional pieces included 8 duplicate wheels (40 - 84), 1 ring, 1 rack, 3 specialty shapes, and 1 cross made out of blue plastic.  All pieces believed to be original except as noted.
This set, almost half a century old, is in pretty good condition overall.  The lid shows wear at corners and there's a tear on the left flap.  The corners on the base have been taped.  2 of the A pieces have 1 of the pins broken off - they still connect to the other pieces but aren't as stable.  2 of the end pieces have both of the pins broken off.  All the pens are there but they don't work.

Iconic mid-century design. Handsome mahogany (says SOLID MAHOGANY on bottom) with gold metal (probably plated brass) and plastic detail. 
Clock was run for 24 hours and kept time well. 
Item shows use but still looks very good. I don't like to mess with finishes but I think this would clean up well with wood refinishing product and metal polish. Cord and plug in good clean condition. Plastic crystal is fuzzy.

4634,Bennett bolo Tie with Turquoise stone.,"
            This ones for the serious turquoise collector! This Bennett bolo tie is seriously amazing! It's in great shape and someone really loved this piece...so much so that they had their name engraved on the back. The stone has really cool quarts matrix throughout and the most vivid color! Clasp works great, leather is in perfect condition. Last photo shows the Bennett Pat Pend hallmark. Bennett bolo's sell for 180-250. I've only seen one other one with a stone this big and it sold for 250. #turquoise #bolo #bolotie #bennett #hallmark #sterlingsilver #navajo #kingman        ",185.00,5.0,"Vintage item

5266,Drawing of children from Germaine Bouret - 1940 - Litography,"
            Lithography of a drawing from Germaine Bouret (1907-1953), very rare to find in this dimension (length 50cm, 32.5cm width).
Germaine Bouret was born in Paris May 29, 1907, a Berry father and an English mother. Very young she is attracted by the drawing and in 1922, at age 15, she won a national competition in this discipline. She took drawing classes in a reputable school, rue Madame in Paris, then she returned for a short time as a fashion designer at the fashion house Lanvin. In 1926 and 1927 she participated in the ""Salon des Humoristes"" and exhibits two drawings next to the famous illustrators of the time.
At 20, in 1927, she created her company as ""Bouret Editions"" Author-Publisher. Her first works are for menus and prints. In 1927 she illustrated her first book, ""Touche à tout, ses tragiques mésaventures"", published by Fernand Nathan.
Quickly she specializes in postcard and prints in different formats, which will adorn, for generations, the walls of most French households. In 1937 she was Deputy Secretary General in the Arts and Techniques category for the Universal Exhibition in Paris. 
In the early forties Walt Disney, recruiting designers in Europe for its studios in the US, made him an offer she refused. After his death it will say of her: ""She was the best designer in the world"".  Mainly drawing children, she was asked to work on youth. She also worked for advertising. Lesieur has used its work for flyers and recipe cards, Vittelloise, she also created the slogan ""water that sings and dances"" Jacquemaire for its boxes illustration Blédine of flour well Patisfrance supply confectioners, the little boy and the slogan ""Eat cakes often, it's delicious and nutritious"" are known to all. It should be noted that this company is still using this today, for over fifty years. While other companies are to his credit including Maggi, Nestle, Kohler, Petit Bateau, to name only the best known.

6209,Male Dog Belly Band - Dog Diaper - Dog Potty Training Aid - house breaking - incontienence wrap - fleece - X Small to X Large - CUSTOM ORDER,"
            Great for dogs and puppies working on house breaking, dogs who mark, senior dogs, or dogs with incontinence. To make this super absorbent, line interior of band with a self adhesive feminine napkin or adult urine absorbing pad. 
This listing is for one custom sized belly band made to fit your puppy or dog. 
WHEN YOU CHECKOUT, PLEASE ADD TO THE CHECKOUT NOTES: 
""Straight"" or ""Contoured"" 
I will make your bands straight unless otherwise specified. Please also note any special requests such as a larger or smaller width (1 extra inch smaller or larger is included at no charge.) Make any other requests you would like. I always review the notes before I begin work on your belly band. 
Size Chart: 
Your dog's girth should fall in the middle of the suggested girth measurements below. As you get toward the end of the range, some velcro will be exposed. Example:  If your dog measures 12"", select the small band.
Extra Small  15"" x 3""         Fits dogs with a girth of 9"" - 13""       
Small  16.5"" x 4""                Fits dogs with a girth of 10 - 15""      
Medium  21.5"" x 4""           Fits dogs with a girth of 14"" - 20""     
Large  26.5"" x 5""               Fits dogs with a girth of 19"" - 25""     
Extra Lg  32"" x 6""              Fits dogs with a girth of 24"" - 30""  
Custom sizes and options are always available, just send me a convo and I'll make up a special order just for you. I can also sew in an absorbent pad.
********************************IMPORTANT***********************************
Please provide your DOG'S GIRTH MEASUREMENTS in your checkout notes
Dog sizes are NOT standardized, so you must measure your dog to get a proper fit for this diaper. If you do not provide your dog's measurement in your checkout notes, I am unable to accept a return or exchange for a sizing issue. For sanitary reasons, I can't resell a returned diaper.
It is my top priority to get you a proper fitting diaper. I hate to see people disappointed when items don't fit. I stand behind my products 100% and will make it right if there is an error on my part. Please help me to provide the best experience possible by providing your dog's measurement. I know it's a pain, I always hate measuring my own dogs - but do it just this once. Your pup will thank you!
*********************************************************************************
Features:
-100% cotton exterior fabric
-Soft absorbent fleece interior fabric
-Straight bands have 2 strips of 4"" of hook and loop tape. Contoured bands have a wider 3"" of hook and loop. This allows for an adjustable fit, soft side of the hook and loop always faces the tummy.
-I only use Gutermann polyester thread. This durable high quality thread will not pull moisture up to the cotton layer as cotton thread will tend to do.
- Quality, reinforced stitches
- Elastic - If selected, elastic is sewn on either side of the band and works much like the elastic in a baby diaper. It holds the band closer and fits all the contours of your dogs body. I recommend elastic for smooth coated or barrel chested dogs. I can also make the elastic smaller on one side, which has helped some very barrel chested dogs in the past. Just let me know in your checkout notes. Also consider adding an inch or two to your girth measurement if you do not like your elastic tight. If you are unsure, just send me a convo and I'll help you get the perfect size. 
- Waterproof PUL - If selected, the waterproof PUL layer is sewn between your fabric layers. You won't see it. Consider adding an inch to your width. If your dog has a large or forward set penis, he may urinate too close to the edge of the band and the cotton will pull the moisture up at the very edges. An extra inch can make all the difference in solving this problem. This PUL is the same stuff we use in human diapers.

Care:
Close the hook and loop tape before washing to avoid the hooks attaching to other items or collecting threads in them.
Machine wash in cool or warm water. Air dry for longest life. If you use the dryer, use the lowest setting possible.
Please use a color catcher sheet if you wash these with other items. The fleece can shed some color in the first few washings.
To remove urine odor, add regular vinegar to the rinse cycle. I also like the product OdoBan. I add both of these to the ""softener"" section of my washing machine.        ",7.95,5.0,"Handmade item

4 CHAIRS - 12"" Seat Height
Our Red Oak Child's School Chairs are reminiscent of a 1930's school chair constructed in the Arts & Crafts or Mission Style. Back leg is canted to add stability. We are so confident in the quality of our chairs, WE  GUARANTEE  THEM  AGAINST BREAKAGE AND MATERIAL DEFECT  FOR LIFE.     If they are returned to us, we will repair or replace them at no charge.
TABLE - 30""L x 22""W x 22""H
We designed the Red Oak Child's Table as a companion for our School Chair. The chamfered leg was created for interest, while keeping the overall straight lines of Arts & Crafts or Mission Style.  Legs are removable to save on shipping. 
We have followed the tradition of building children's furniture that is heirloom quality - something to last from one generation to the next. We make our tables and chairs just like we build adult furniture using the same quality materials. We color them with Honey Brown stain color and use an easy care moisture resistant finish. All edges of our chairs and tables have been gently rounded for the safety of young children.
We use solid Red Oak, we do not use MDF or plywood.
WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE OUR CHILDREN'S TABLES AND CHAIRS IN STOCK, SO CHECK BEFORE BUYING IF YOU NEED IMMEDIATE DELIVERY.

            Light up the night with our Flame Tongue fans. Our most ornate set of fire fans is also our most beautiful. Conscious design and artisan skill are utilized in each pair and the intricate metal work with it's black finish is exquisite. The weight should be just about right for most fire performers and burlesque acts, particularly if you find fans can be a little on the heavy side. The finger ring has been smoothed down to allow for the most comfortable spins and rotations possible.
The 5 Kevlar prongs will give adequate burn time and can be replaced with relative ease when necessary.  Each fan weighs 380g. 
These are supplied as a pair.
Fire Dancing with fans is obviously extremely dangerous and should only be practiced by adults with adequate safety knowledge.        ",147.97,4.8923,"Handmade item

***IMPROVED COVERS***
All journals measure 5"" x 7"" and are bound with Black Twin Loop Wire Binding. Covers have been IMPROVED and are made using a light weight kraft chipboard paper or a heavyweight white card stock paper and then laminated for extra durability and protection. These types of paper are sturdy and can be used with my Epson printer and still allow for the personal customization you prefer for your journal. With the sentimental value that a journal carries, quality materials are extremely important!
If laminated covers are not preferred, please note ""No Lamination"" in the note to seller section when ordering.
The journals are so versatile and can be used in a number of ways such as a notebook, diary, travel journal, scrapbook, photo book, drawing notebook, art book, a journal for your thoughts or goals, and the list can go on and on. They are also excellent gifts!!
The journals come in the following two sizes (paper quantity) - Standard or Double Paper. 
Standard
-- Blank white paper - 40 sheets (80 sides) 
-- Lined white paper - 40 sheets (80 sides) 
-- White card stock - 25 sheets (50 sides)  
-- Brown kraft card stock - 25 sheets (50 sides) 
Double Paper    ****Money Saver Option****
-- Blank white paper - 80 sheets (160 sides) 
-- Lined white paper - 80 sheets (160 sides) 
-- White card stock - 50 sheets (100 sides)  
-- Brown kraft card stock - 50 sheets (100 sides) 
With so many choices to choose from, you can customize your journal just the way you want it!
White or brown kraft card stock paper is the recommended choice if your journal is to be used for scrapbooking, drawings, photos, adding accessories or using markers on your pages. This type of paper is thicker and more sturdier that regular white paper.
As with the beauty of all things handmade, variances do occur. Each journal is handmade - designed, printed, cut, laminated, bound, packaged and shipped by me with personal loving care. Please note that all journals are made to order, so please allow up to 3-5 business days for production before shipping. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. And remember to ""give a little something"".

This white crochet shawl is made by using pineapple pattern on its bottom edges. It has hidden sparkles due to the yarn’s low metallic content. 
The shawl is soft, light and warm. It is ideal for weddings. I crocheted 4 cords. Two of the cords are ended with pineapple motives and the other two are ended with white beads. You may wear it as shawl, capelet or neck warmer in several shapes according to intended use.

The M3 Lava used to create the body of this gorgeous pen is produced with real volcanic material from ancient dormant volcanoes found in the Southwest, USA. The volcanic ash is found in a variety of natural colors allowing for dramatic color contrast with other materials especially metal. Once reconstructed by the M3 process, the new molecular structure of the Lava is extremely strong, heat resistant and exhibits a beautiful, durable natural surface.
Macro-Molecular Materials (M3) are part of the new breed of new age designer materials that make everything from the Stealth Bomber to the International Space Station possible. These materials are made with high purity metals and other exotic elements that have been deconstructed to the macro-molecular level, homogenously combined and then reconstructed with highly refined proprietary chemical binders.  Objects produced from M3 Mokume will literally last forever.

            Fake Lip Ring, Lip cuff, Faux, Snake Bites, Body Jewelry, No Piercing, Silver Lip Piercing, Unique Gift For her, Minimal, Bar, Statement
Inchoo isn’t a simple ornamentation, it’s a jewel combining romanticism and eccentricity; it’s the mystery of a feminine symbol that’s not afraid to show a darker side. Every piece becomes a unique poem, unveiling force and finesse through noble materials.
Listing is for 1 Sterling Silver Bar Fake Lip Ring.
Bar mesures a little less that 20mm.
Inchoo traces its place in elegance and an unchanging contrast between gothic curves and popular culture that blends with imagination. In a world where unicorns caress rose thorns, where birds sing their way onto deer antlers, comes a symbol of a woman who is willing to show her darker side. Rawk calls to the mystery that flows with delicate curves in hair and chiaroscuro eyes. Aspire looks and envy at the rhythm of your heels and embrace your inner enchantress. Inchoo isn’t a simple ornamentation, it’s the symbioses of Romantisme and the extravagance that are within your charm.
Astrid loves baroque inspired environments, the dark and gothic inspired looks but also the highly feminine and glamour tastes of it. Her world flirts around skulls, taxidermy and macabre inspired themes as much as big statement shiny and haute couture jewelry. She loves to create new pieces using the body as a canvas. Inchoo Bijoux is for her, the perfect balance between gothic and glamour jewelry. Hope you enjoy them as much as she loves making them for you ! 
Care
Jewellery in Sterling silver and Bronze are easy maintenance. You can keep them clean by cleansing them with an old tooth brush and some Dawn (dish soap without Phosphate). To keep them shiny and a premature tarnish, keep them in hermetic bags and away from plants, as they emanate big concentrations of oxygen.

18281,Swirl Taper,"
            Acrylic Swirl Tapers. These funky tapers are perfect for taking your ear lobes to the next size! 
Please note price is for 1 taper only, not a pair. If you require a pair, please select ""pair"" 
These are brand new but not sterilised.
**Some Friendly Advise On Stretching***
As a professional body piercer, I recommend my clients stretching their ear lobes to not skip sizes and to ""upsize"" (stretch to the next size) once every 2 months only to allow sufficient healing time and minimise the risk of blow outs and scarring. Also to have a soak in a hot bath or shower before hand to help elastic the skin and to apply non flavored vaseline to the jewelry to help it to slide into the ear easier and cause less trauma to the area.
*please note I cannot issue refunds or exchanges on body jewelry unless the item is faulty        ",2.98,5.0,"Handmade item

19491,Handmade Leather Kid's Toddler Unisex Sandals,"
            All leather handmade leather kid's sandals are so sweet. Stacked leather heel, leather sole fastened with little nails  and an ankle strap that buckles. These vintage leather sandals are seriously unisex. The detailed stitching on the front is beautiful. 
Remember to rub them with olive oil so that bad chemicals don't rub into the child's skin. I treated them with olive oil at the time of listing.
