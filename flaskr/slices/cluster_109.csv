When ordering please comment which deodorant it is you want e.g. 'Vegan' or 'latex allergen free' otherwise I will send you my original formula deodorant. 
As a natural deodorant, it does exactly what it's supposed to do, and leaves a refreshing lingering scent. 
It does not stop you sweating, as this is your body's way of removing toxins. It works with your body's natural equilibrium.. Does not contain any harmful chemicals, synthetic fragrances parabens or aluminium.
If this is your first time using a natural deodorant it can take up to 4 weeks for the detox process to occur so you may see a slight increase in odour to start with.
Probiotics used within this formula help combat the bad bacteria that cause the body odour and work together with your friendly flora for optimal results.
I have personally tried and tested this product and still use it, as a bit of a health freak and fitness fanatic it really does the trick in the smelly department.
But stick with it and your body's natural balance will be restored.
Different fragrances are available in a 1oz and 3.4oz bar just the right size for underarm use.

ABOUT BRASS
.............................
Brass is a yellow alloy of copper and zinc. It resembles gold in color.
This will tarnish and patina over time turning a dark brownish aged color.
This look can be just as beautiful as the shiny new brass.
However, if you prefer your brass to shine simply clean it with your Sunshine polishing cloth.
Another note about brass is how it reacts to the chemistry of your skin. For some it can leave that green mark behind. This is a reaction of the oxidizing of the copper on your skin. Everyone's skin is different, but it is harmless.
If you want to create a barrier between your skin and the brass, a clear coat of enamel or nail polish will do the trick. In fact, most costume jewelry is already coated in this clear enamel for that reason. We choose NOT to coat or plate our metal so that you can experience the richness as the metal changes over time.
