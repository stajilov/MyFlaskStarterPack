6401,"Custom Pet Portrait - your photo, my crazy RISK FREE portrait offer","
            Custom Pet Portraits - Download All Sizes & Formats
I will paint a beautiful and unique hand-painted digital portrait of your pet from your photos using a digital art pen and tablet (see examples above).
Here's the 'crazy' part. Once the digital painting is complete I will supply you with the artwork files ONLY (I will not ship a canvas) : you will receive the digital portrait files preformatted for every possible use, that you can use again and again:
► 4 different sizes for CANVAS printing (8x10"", 11x14"", 12x16"", 16x20"");
specially expanded and resized for printing onto stretched canvas ie including extra painted borders to provide wraparound for a 'gallery wrapped' canvas. Print at any local or internet print-shop offering wrapped canvas prints.
► 4 different sizes for PAPER printing (8x10"", 11x14"", 12x16"", 16x20"");
cropped & formatted to standard 'photographic' print sizes for hassle-free printing and reprinting whenever you need them - just print at your favourite local or internet print-shop.
Once I have your photos I will start the digital painting and then contact you in approx 1 week with images of the painting for you to review. I will 100% guarantee to make as many changes as you want until you are completely happy with your portrait after which you can download the files, or simply refund your 49.99 through Etsy if you are still not happy with the review images. Satisfaction guaranteed and entirely risk free.
Today, most local print-shops will do paper prints and stretched canvas prints very cheaply from your images ... meaning you save on potentially expensive shipping costs & customs fees, shipping time, and risk of damage from here in UK to wherever you are in the world, and YOU decide what size, and when you want it printed. And when your pooch chews your possessions (and your portrait) when you're out shopping, just have another printed!
--------------------------------
Terms of Use: Please note you are free to do whatever you want with your portrait images for personal use, BUT NOT commercial use - you cannot sell the image or sell prints, or file share with friends, because I retain the painting copyright. I don't normally sell prints of my custom paintings but reserve the right to use them as examples. However let me know and I won't use your painting for anything against your wishes. 
--------------------------------
Thanks for reading my listing! Convo me if you want to discuss a portrait, you can attach your photos there, or email your photos to : admin @ anyportrait.co.uk.
Iain.

Check out some of the lovely feedback I have had from others here on Etsy!

7895,Aaron Burr-Scented Candle,"
            If you can’t afford tickets to a certain hit Broadway show about Alexander Hamilton, then why not do the next best thing: Listen to the soundtrack. 
But if for some reason you can’t do that, then why not do something else entirely: Buy an Aaron Burr-Scented Candle!
The Aaron Burr-Scented Candle smells of gunsmoke drifting low in the Weehawken dawn. Like its namesake, it is elegant, mysterious, and unprincipled (at least compared to other candles). It’s perfect for burning incriminating evidence of your treasonous plots, setting the mood while you a seduce a wealthy heiress, or both at the same time. (Why not!)
Aaron Burr always had some kind of fun scheme afoot, like the time he founded a water company that didn’t provide anyone with water, because it was actually the bank JPMorgan Chase. The Aaron Burr-Scented Candle is always hatching schemes, too, most of which revolve around trying to set your stuff on fire. So just like with the real Aaron Burr, you’re going to want to keep your eye on it, and not undermine its campaign to become governor of New York.
-
Did you know that Aaron Burr once tried to light a candle by shooting at it with his gun? It worked, but it also set his shirt and a bunch of his stuff on fire. There’s a lesson in there somewhere, but we don’t know what it is.

10099,Fabric marble maze game - level 4 - fidget toy - fine motor skills - quiet time game - self regulation tool - autism - Alzheimer's -dementia,"
            Marble mazes are great sensory games that are fun for children and adults!  A marble has been sewn between two layers of soft flannel fabric, and a path stitched (tripled stitched for strength and durability) into a maze pattern.  The object of the game is to push the marble through the maze path, from one patterned corner to the other, and vice versa.
This listing is for a level 4 difficulty marble maze. Please see my store for the different levels of marble mazes I have. 
This activity encourages
-focus and patience 
-hand/eye coordination 
-fine motor skills
-problem solving
Marble mazes are an excellent game to use with children on the spectrum, hand therapy patients, seniors with Alzheimer's and dementia, etc. It is a great quite time activity that easily fits in your purse or diaper bag which makes it perfect to pull out at church, the doctors office, restaurants and car rides. Also, as a teacher, I have seen marble mazes used in the classroom as a self regulation technique. 
The marble maze is approximately 8 by 10 inches. One side is a fun, colourful pattern and the other side is a solid colour that makes it easy for the maze pattern to be seen. 
Please choose the pattern/colour you would like in the pull down section when ordering or contact me about a custom fabric choice. 
Items will ship within 3-5 days of receipt of payment. Please refer to my shop policies for questions regarding shipping.
This product is made by me with care in a clean, pet-free, smoke-free home.
Cleaning instructions: To clean your marble maze simply throw it in the wash machine and let it air dry.        ",9.25,4.875,"Handmade item

10401,Little Red Riding Hood Boutique Costume Size 2T 3T 4T 5 6,"
            This is an adorable boutique girls dress/costume crafted to look just like Little Red Riding Hood. It is a 3 piece set including a red and white gingham knot dress, a white tie on apron, and a red hooded cape.  It is perfect for Halloween, but the dress alone is great to wear anytime as well.  It is great on it's own, but just as cute with a shirt and leggings underneath (order a size up to layer). The bodice has two slits in which the straps are woven through and knotted, so it gives it a unique look, plus there are no buttons or snaps to mess with. The bottom trim, inner bodice and reverse of straps are made from red fabric that coordinates perfectly with the print of the fabric.

            COMFORTABLE STRAP / BARREL STYLE SLIDER / BLACK HOOK STRAP
THE ORIGINAL UKE THONG® 
NO HARD PLASTIC HOOK TO SCRATCH THE SOUND HOLE OF YOUR UKE!
NO BUCKLE TO SCRATCH YOUR UKE!
This adjustable cord lock ukulele strap is light and comfortable. It is made for a uke - NOT a retrofitted guitar strap! (The sound hole hook on a guitar strap is too thick, and tends to buzz against a soprano ukulele first string.) The sound hole hook is padded with the webbing to protect your instrument. Hook into sound hole and place the webbing under the waist of the instrument. For Pineapples, Flukes and Fleas, run the webbing forward, parallel with the fretboard, and then behind the neck. I am a uke player and make these by hand. Please look at my feedback to see comments from happy Uke Thong purchasers.
Here is a very talented customer using a Uke Thong: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nisc5F5Gf90  Note how the right forearm against the lower bout frees up the left hand for more elegant playing.  And here is a nice review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY67QzTJJ5A
HERE IS A VARIATION: Unlike most ukulele sound hole straps, Uke Thong straps are long enough for most people to use across the chest (under one arm), rather than around the neck.
UPON REORDERING, A SATISFIED CUSTOMER SAYS: I received my 1st Uke Thong today and it is really excellent, far better than anything else on the market - now I need one for each of my ukuleles! Many thanks Simon

https://www.etsy.com/shop/PickslaysWoodworking/policy?ref=shopinfo_policies_leftnav
Q: HOW DO I ADD MULTIPLE PICKS WITH DIFFERENT WOOD TYPES/OPTIONS?
A: Please ""Add to Cart"" one guitar pick at a time and then purchase all guitar picks together.
Q: WHERE ARE THE FONT OPTIONS?
A: (Refer to 2nd picture above)
Q: HOW BIG ARE THESE PICKS? 
A: My guitar picks are approximately 
 1 1/16 inch or 26 mm wide
 1 1/2 inch long or 31 mm
 1/8 of an inch thick or 3 mm thick to insure durability and to allow the grooves at the top of the pick to be deeper, allowing for better grip
Some guitar picks may not be exactly those dimensions. But I do my best to make them as close to those measurements as I can. I do this by hand and I have to estimate as I sand them by hand. 
Q. CAN YOU ACTUALLY PLAY WITH THESE?
A: Yes, wood guitar picks offer a great sound on pretty much all kinds of guitars.
Feel and sound:
For sound,
They make a great smooth sound when they hit the strings. It doesn't have that plasticky sound that a plastic pick has as it rolls off each string. Customers and friends say that they make a beautiful sound.
For feel,
Smooth to the touch, great grip at the top. It's hard to see in the pictures, but there are indentations at the top on both sides for gripping. Engravings add some roughness but give more friction to make it even easier to grip.
Check to see pictures of the indentations for the grip at the top of the pick at my about page:
https://www.etsy.com/shop/PickslaysWoodworking/about?ref=l2-about
[DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLASTIC AND WOOD PICKS]
 Wood has no flexibility and is very firm.
  Wood offers a much clearer and stronger strum
  It doesn't have that plastic plucking sound that most plastic picks have as the pick catches on every string. 
  It gives a great sound.
*grain patterns will vary from pick to pick, 
the above picture is a stock photo,
however, other picks will compare in quality, color, and grain pattern

*ALSO AVAILABLE IN VALUE BUNDLE WITH OTHER PRESETS*

   -  Best results are with RAW/DNG files. Results with Jpeg files are unpredictable.
   -  Works in Lightroom 5-6 (CC) 
   -  ACR version available

// INSTRUCTIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING // 
Installing: 
After downloading presets into your folder of choice, open Lightroom and right-click on the folder you want to import the preset into. Click 'import', and select the downloaded preset. 
Using the preset: 
Get the right colour temperature and exposure in your image first, then click on the preset for the edit. You may need to increase or decrease the exposure after the edit has been applied. 
A NOTE ON EXPOSURE: I generally shoot slightly underexposed to optimise skin tones in my portraits- I will usually apply the preset first, then slowly increase exposure, over shoot, then decrease until the colours and skin tones feel right. If your image looks overly contrasty or muddy, an increase in exposure usually helps.

Now for some fascinating facts about TPG Designs!
1) You have stumbled upon the Originator of the Vintage Book Wedding Flower Phenomenon! (Yes, before 2011 the WORLD was VOID of vintage book wedding bouquets/book wedding flowers. If you had searched etsy, if you had searched google, if you had searched pinterest...you would have found NOTHING. And I do mean NOTHING! Then this little papergirl came along to trend-set what is now a massive book wedding flower phenomenon! #likeaboss)
2) I utilize inspired design. And what is inspired design? It is the process of capturing that which is inexplicable and expressing it through the heart and hands. This is a MUCH DIFFERENT process than simply ""making things."" Inspired design incorporates ethereal elements (other-worldy!) and brings them into this world! 
3) My trend-setting bouquets/flowers have been featured in such prominent places as:
Mollie Makes UK
BUZZFEED
MSN Living
Wedding Chicks
Offbeat Bride

            4 PC 10” to 12” Oak Wood Log Slice Rustic Crafts/Wedding/Cabin/Décor 
These are freshly cut from hand selected logs They can be used for crafts, decor, weddings, carvings, arts, woodworking, holidays, rustic cabin, centerpieces.
Oak Slices: 
10” to 12” in length 
8” to 10” in width 
Around 1” in thickness 
May have a slight oval shape 
You will not receive the exact slices pictured. 
The slices will have a natural strong odor until they dry. This is typical with most types of fresh cut wood slices. The slices will show saw marks, and not be perfectly even and still have some degree of moisture, usually below 40%.
Slices should be separated and air dried after receiving. Drying time can vary by location and other factors, such as, temperature, humidity. If these are for an event please allow for drying time when ordering. 
As the slices dry there can be cracking, checking and loss of bark, this is a natural process and adds character to the pieces. To help slow the natural cracking process a sealant can be applied after they dry some.
We try to provide quality fresh cut wood slices at a reasonable price to our customers. We inspect each slice for quality before shipping.
We are not responsible for any cracking, checking or loss of bark that may occur during the natural drying process. We are not responsible for any odor that occurs with fresh cut wood while it is going through its natural drying process. These things are natural with fresh cut wood and we have no control over it.
These are fresh cut after an order is placed and have a 3 to 5 day handling time. We ship using USPS or FedEx. Shipping to the lower 48 states only. Shipping is not available to Alaska/Hawaii, US Protectorates, APO/FPO, PO Boxes.        ",34.95,4.875,"Handmade Supply
