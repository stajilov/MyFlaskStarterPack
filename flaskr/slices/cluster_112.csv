1026,"Lunch at the Ritz Earrings, Collection from 1988.","
            These are from the ""Lunch at the Ritz Collection of '88. These incredibly wild, whimsical earrings speak for themselves.  They're pierced and fierce.  Wearable Art. The back of the earring has a gold finish and is signed.  Featuring glittery yellow enamel, multi-color rhinestones, spiral designs, a gold star with a rhinestone center AND a woman standing on the moon in a sparkly green party dress.  You know she's happy.  The woman who wears these earrings is not afraid to make a statement. She's fun, confident and sure of herself. Designed by Esme Hecht and Zander Elliott. Made in the USA.
After some research, I believe there may be a part of the earring that is missing because these earrings are usually longer.  ALSO towards the bottom tip of one of these earrings, there is a slight crack that did not go through to the metal in the back.  I touched it up to protect it.  I think they'll be great and will be sold as is. 
Considering the information above, you can make the decision to buy or not to buy.  They remain a remarkable-looking pair of earrings.

The zipper part is starting to rip at the seams. :/

Ships Priority insured
Here is a snipit I pulled from Past Perfect Vintage:
Caspar- Davis
A California milliner, Caspar Davis was often mentioned and advertised alongside such artists as G. Howard Hodge and Leslie James.  Caspar Davis received national newspaper coverage form at at least 1941 to 1969. I found two lines mentioned: âStudio Stylesâ and âMovie Modeâ.
Prices ranged from 25 - 45, so these were expensive hats. Caspar Davis used Hollywood studio starlets to model hats for much of their advertising, certainly using the glamor of film to add cachet to the lines. The Pittsburg Post Gazette in 1941 called Caspar-Davis one of Californiaâs outstanding designers.In 1955, Caspar Davis is credited with hats for the TV series, My Little Margie.

http://etsy.me/2glDQrl
My healing honey soap offers the ultimate relief for dry, sensitive, or itchy skin. An entire pound of honey goes into every batch I make! The honey I use is completely raw and unfiltered to provide maximum benefits. Honey is antibacterial, it helps your skin retain moisture, and the high level of anti-oxidants keep skin elastic and youthful. I add additional oil to this soap to make it ultra-moisturizing. I'm able to do this because the honey acts as a preservative so that the soap stays fresh but full of amazing moisture! 
This is a great facial soap, too! Honey is the perfect ingredient to apply topically! It not only hydrates and repairs, but it's full of antioxidants as well. This will protect your skin!
My soap bars range from 4-5 oz, but please allow for small color and size variations as each small batch is lovingly made by me.
This soap is made with top quality ingredients and essential oils and is very gentle--it's great for sensitive and dry skin and won't irritate. I recommend this as an everyday soap that will moisturize and not overpower you with fragrance. Just the light, rich, and subtle smell of raw and natural honey. I use 100% raw honey made from bees who harvest on organic fruit farms and it shows in the lovely, rich scent. 
This is a very different kind of soap, so please be ready for a unique experience. This is not a deep clean soap! It's formulated to help your skin retain moisture and your natural oils that act as a protection barrier. 
**I highly recommend buying a soap saver especially with this bar due to the soft and gentle composition. This will help maximize the use of the soap.**

Peacock Rainbow Topazâ¢ is produced by enhancing white topaz with a vapor deposition coating. Topaz is the birthstone for November.
Stone shape: Oval
Stone size: 10x8mm
Color: Blue-green with a rainbow play of colors
Clarity: Clear and bright
Mohs hardness: 8
Refractive index: 1.609â1.637
Specific gravity: 3.53
Treatment: Coated (C)
Country of origin: THAILAND
âºplease note: This stone features a coating that can be removed by harsh chemicals, irreparably damaging the look of the stone. Care: Wash with warm, soapy water. Avoid exposure to any harsh chemicals. Never clean ultrasonically. Never steam clean.
âº14K Gold Filled is a federally regulated amount of 14K gold (5%) rolled on to a base metal, usually brass. It is the next best thing to solid 14K gold. It has no nickel in it and is considered hypoallergenic. It will not tarnish or discolor your skin. The finish will last one to five years under heavy wear (like a ring - though I have lots of rings and bracelets that are still great looking after 20 years) and a lifetime under occasional wear (like an ear cuff or earring).

Abalone shell barrettes are 2"" long by 1/4"" wide on a silver plated metal french barrette base. They are very easy to open and close. They do not hold a LOT of hair, however will sufficiently pull back the hair on one side of the head quite nicely on normal (not super thick) hair. 
The colors of this abalone are stunning!
I designed and created this product after seeing the rectangular strands of Paua Abalone at a gem show and then subsequently seeing the hair barrette blanks in a local store. BOOM. This fabulous idea for hair jewelry was born. The end result EXCEEDED my original expectations. 
The Abalone shell is carefully matched to make sure the design is cohesive within the pair of barrettes. 
**Abalone always has some slight variations. You will receive a pair of barrettes that are similar to what is pictured, but not identical. 
Happy primping!

14135,Personalized Monogram Name STENCIL // Customized Name Stencil  // Wedding Stencil // DIY Decor,"
            WHAT IS A ONE-TIME USE VINYL STENCIL?:
Vinyl stencils allow DIYers of all levels to achieve flawless results because unlike reusable stencils, the adhesive backing seals your design to the project surface, minimizing the risk of paint build-up under the stencil. Each stencil comes with three layers: a backing to protect the adhesive side of the vinyl, cut & pre-weeded vinyl (this is the stencil!), and clear transfer tape to hold your stencil together, eliminating the need to cut up your design with additional 'bridges'.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DETAILS:
Choose from 4 different size options.
2-piece stencil set--name comes as a separate stencil.
Size option indicates the actual size of the stencil with a 1/2 inch margin around the design. Design itself will be 1 inch smaller than the designated stencil size.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS:
When checking out you will have the opportunity to add a note--please include the name and date you wish to have on your stencil.
A proof of the design will be sent to you within 24-48 hours. 
Please look at your proof carefully to ensure all information is correct. Once the design is approved, any changes will result in an additional fee. If the stencil is already cut, a replacement stencil will need to be purchased, and if applicable, additional shipping charges will be applied. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TERMS & CONDITIONS:
PRODUCT ACKNOWLEDGMENT
Stencils are made of ONE-TIME use vinyl.
PERSONALIZED/CUSTOMIZED  DETAILS AND SIZING
It is the customerâs responsibility to ensure all names, dates, quotes or additional personalized information for a stencil is accurate. It is also the customerâs responsibility to ensure the correct size stencil is ordered. Free replacement stencils will only be sent if the customized details/size that are received are different from the information that was provided or the size that was ordered.
PROOF OF STENCIL DESIGN
Certain stencils require approval from the customer before they can be cut and shipped (as indicated in product description). Your proof will be sent to the email address provided, and should arrive within 24-48 hours of purchase. In order to prevent a shipment delay, it is important that you watch for this email and respond as quickly as possible. Any changes that are requested will be made within 24 hours and a new proof will then be sent.
VINYL DISCLAIMER
The product(s) you receive are made using a premium 3mm removable adhesive vinyl and clear transfer tape. Changes in climate and temperature can cause your stencil to shrink or expand. This is why you might notice that your stencil looks wrinkled when you remove it from the box. This should in no way affect the use of your stencil, but it is recommended that you use your stencil as quickly as possible.
It is also important to note that if you apply your stencil in temperatures that are too hot or too cold, it could affect the way your stencil adheres to your project surface. If temperatures are below 55 degrees the adhesive might not stick, and if temperatures are above 85 degrees the adhesive might become overly sticky and extra care should be taken when removing the stencil from the release liner and transferring it to your project surface.
PRODUCT USE DISCLAIMER
This product is a tool to aide in your DIY project. Instructions are included with each purchase, but it is highly recommended that you research the product/surface you will you be painting on prior to use to ensure proper preparation, paint and techniques are used. DIY Design Company is not responsible for failure to use proper techniques with your DIY Design Company stencil.
ORDER TIMELINE
Our company custom makes all products within 3-5 business days. Oftentimes, orders process faster than that but we canât guarantee a faster processing time.
CUSTOM ORDERS
We offer several custom options, so hopefully you will find what you need through the shop! If you need a specific size that is not listed, please send us a message!
RETURNS
Due to the custom nature of our stencils, we are not able to accept returns or exchanges.
REPLACEMENTS
Should a stencil arrive different than what what was ordered, send us a message and we will correct the issue as quickly as possible! Please see above for Vinyl Disclaimer and Product Use Disclaimer.
CANCELLATIONS

Hello & Welcome GraphicHouseDesign specializes in svg files, dxf files and png files.
All of our cutting files are available for small business use up to 100 pieces per design and unlimited personal projects you can create for your family or offer as gift. 
Most of our files are available in svg, dxf and png version that allows you to use your files across a wide range of cutting machines but also as iron on files in case you do not own a cutting machines. 
A closer look at the file formats:
* SVG FILES: SVG Files are suitable for Cricut cutting machine and other cutting machines such as Brother Scanncut, Pazzles Inspiration (the Pro Version), Silhouette Cameo (the Designers Edition), Sizzix Eclips etc. 
In case you are not sure about the version of your machine/software edition, please make sure you consult your cutting machines instructions manual as we are not able to offer additional advise on this. 
*DXF FILES: Are suitable for users that own a Silhouette Cameo Standard Edition. Import the DXF File from your Silhouette Studio Workspace and it should load fine. 
*PNG FILES: We offer PNG Files for iron on activities such as printing on t-shirts and all projects that use heat transfer materials. 
Please note that our PNG Files are not reversed. You should be able to reverse your file either from your printerâs setting box or the editing software you might use before sending your PNG to printer. 
PNG Files are also useful in designing projects as overlays, clipart and also as printables on their own.  
HOW TO TURN YOUR PNG INTO A PRINTABLE:
This is an easy procedure. Open a new file with any editing program (even Microsoft Word would do) at the dimension you would like to print it. 
Import your PNG inside and place it to the position you wish it to be printed. Print and enjoy your printable. 
Maximum printing dimension (for best quality): 12X12 inches for PNG Files. 
*Please note that the same procedure can be followed with your SVG file (if your editing software imports SVG). The difference with the SVG is that itâs a vector file and therefore can be stretched to any dimension you prefer. This is most preferable in case you need a big sign or label.

14382,"Banners and Task Bullets Stencil, Bullet Journal Stencil, Field Notes 8.5 cm by 14 cm","
            Do you want to make a neat, cohesive looking journal? Enter this Banners, Flags and Bullet Journal Notations stencil. This stencil was specifically designed with the Field Notes notebook dimensions in mind. 
You will receive a 10 mil suede stencil with 4 banners, 7 flags, 3 boxes, all of the standard bullet journal notations, and over 10 extra graphics on it. All of these graphics fit perfectly on dot and graph paper. The bottom edge is a gradual arc that you can also use as a banner. Just add any of the 7 flags onto the line et voila!
Efficient, productive, and eye pleasing!
The stencil itself is 8.5 cm wide by 14 cm tall so it will tuck into you field notes journal with ease. There is even a hole at the top where you can attach a piece of ribbon for a book mark.
The stencil is pliant and will lie with the curvature of your journal's page. As you become accustomed to using the stencil, you might tack it down with a bit of washi tape. Once you get used to creating your spread with the stencil, you'll probably do away with using the tape. I find that a fine tip pen works best with stencils and I personally use a 03 or 05 Sakura Micron to journal.
We also have a winter stencil full of goodies to glam up your December spread. You can find that here:

Thanks so much for showing us your work last week. It was so nice to meet you, your husband and your kids! What you do is amazing and you are so inspiring. It was an honor to spend time with you and to hear your story! -Bernadette 
Hello hello Feyza,
How great was to meet you in person! I'm so lucky that I got the chance to learn more about you, your story and your business. So thanks a lot for having us! I was really impressed by the high quality of the material you are using, your deep knowledge and the thoughtful details that distinguish all your bags, you are doing a fantastic job! Cheers Francesca.
Love the look, fantastic quality and function of this bag! Thought it was expensive - but worth it as it will last. I got exactly in the picture plus zipper. The canvas seems very durable and the strap is lovely and soft to touch. Excellent stitching and very solid stud clasp (I thought stuff could fall out but the stud works great, pockets are deep and the bag stays standing up too). So many pockets! I have a place for everything and can find it quickly! I'm using as my handbag which is perfect. Great that I can now fit in extra things like lunch. I thought it could be too big for a handbag and that I might struggle to find little things like my keys - definitely not and the key ring solves that. Did take a few months to arrive which wasn't a big deal as I knew upfront. Also great communication throughout. Very happy, thanks!
Wow! Absolutely gorgeous construction. I can't believe it was made by hand. I love the weight of the waxed canvas and just gorgeous. We will love it long after it stops being our diaper bag. Lightening fast shipping, too! I can't believe it took just two days to get from France to the west coast. I will be back for more bags. Thanks I love my bag (and my husband says it's manly enough for him to happily carry too)!!! It fits everything (nalgene, sweater, planner, phone, wallet, keys) and has perfectly useful pockets and a key lanyard. Exquisite materials! I love the interior pockets. I am already planning my next purchase!All I can say is, ""Wow!"" The craftsmanship is beyond compare. I love love love this bag!I highly recommend this item and seller!It's totally worth the money!
This is absolutely THE PERFECT diaper bag. I kind of went out on a limb when I decided to order online. I really like to see things in person first, but I was finding no diaper bags I liked. I found cute ones that weren't functional, or functional ones that certainly weren't cute. When I saw this one, the design caught my eye. Reading further, I saw there were 10 pockets and loved .Well this bag does not disappoint! It feels sturdy, stands on its own, is cute as a button, and doesn't look like you're a mom carrying around a beast of a diaper bag ;) In fact, I know I love it because I'm already using it and baby's not here for another month! If you like the look, you'll love the bag.
This bag is amazing! I get compliments on it every time I go out. The pockets are perfect, one side of the bag has larger pockets for keys, checkbooks, etc and the other side is perfect for my cell phone, lip gloss and other smaller items. I do a lot of traveling for work and this is the perfect bag to take with me. It carries all my things and keeps them organized! The workmanship is beautifully done and this is easily my favorite purse. Thank you! 
Here is smaller size another ikabags but how she is happy with pockets for baby needs !
Here is one lovely customer how she used all pockets for her needs for hers :)

Hi ladies! Finally I'm getting around to reviewing this bag!
I ordered the 10 pocket cross body bag and customized it by adding an 11th zippered pocket. The total (including shipping) ended up being .... The shipping is what really made it expensive IMO, but I get it, it's coming all the way from France! So from the time I ordered it, it took roughly 4 weeks before I got a ""it's shipped!"" notification. But once it shipped, it was actually very fast. I got it in 4 days (I'm in CA). This made me glad I didn't upgrade to express shipping!
Now the bag itself, I really like it! The workmanship is truly exceptional (like I'm the anal kind of person who will scrutinize the seams and make sure they are straight, etc). The bag is exactly how it's represented in her etsy listing!
The material is very durable and the leather accents are gorgeous. Very high quality. I love how the bag can stand up on its own with nothing inside! The key fob attachment is a beautiful touch, I keep my keys and my hand sanitizer clipped on it.
The closure of the bag is just a snap, but honestly I haven't found any issues with this. If the bag tips over and it's snapped closed, nothing falls out. Even if the bag is open, the way the opening is angled really keeps everything in!
At first I was worried that the cross body strap would be uncomfortable if I had tons of stuff in the bag, but I have not found it to be so! I have the strap adjusted to the shortest setting (I'm petite, 5""3) and it's perfect to wear cross body! I do wish that there was a little loop to hold the excess strap to the main strap. I've solved the problem by using a rubber band. When I am using the stroller, the strap does go over the handles and then it's hands free!
I've attached some pictures of the bag and all the stuff I carry in it! I have a 15-almost-16-month-old and I carry:
A changing pad
3-4 diapers
Wipes
Sunglasses (for the both of us)
Snacks
Straw cup
My wallet/wristlets
A notebook/pen
LO's dolly and a small book
Lip balm, mints, keys, hand sanitizer
The interior pockets are very useful and help keep the interior nice and tidy. The diapers will fit into one of the pockets. I keep the changing pad, wipes, and my wallet in the zippered pocket because it's the right shape/big. Seems to work out well that way!
I am pleased with my purchase, I've gotten lots of compliments on it. I like how it doesn't look like a diaper bag. And I like supporting a small business. 
Love this diaper bag! Good quality all around including hardware! Easy to get into with LOTS of room. Bag is sturdy without being heavy (hard to find!). Shipped fast and Owner even helped out with a special shipping request. Wrapped nicely perfect to send as gift to a new mom! Best part is supporting a small business! THANKS! It's totally worth the money!
This bag is exquisite! The french canvas is beautiful quality, the bag is expertly constructed, and the service was super fast! Any hip and trendy mom out there knows how hard it is to find a diaper bag that is both functional and stylish...I have finally found it! I know this bag will last me for years to come - through future babies, and then for my own personal use once we're beyond the diaper bag phase. Thank you for such a fabulous product! I will tell all my friends, and you can expect I'll be back for another bag or two in the future.
I was looking for the perfect school bag and wasn't expecting how truly perfect this would be! It's not only handmade in Paris, France (a place I've been preparing to visit since I was a child) by a wonderful woman with love and precision - it's so fashionable and functional at the same time! I waited only one weekend and it crossed the Atlantic and straight to Ventura County, Southern California! Packaged beautifully with ribbon and all! It's also very sturdy and can hold my big binder, a book and my laptop. My boyfriend and I loved it so much (he has an eye for beautiful things) we went out and bought a heavy weight fabric that looked the same as the interior (the Ecru color), he sewed a foam backing to the fabric and created a pen/pencil case!!! That way, no ink or pencil marks can dirty the bag! Creative, a pleasure to talk to and talented - this shop owner is just amazing. I know where I'm getting my bags from now on ;)        ",115.00,4.8971,"Handmade item
