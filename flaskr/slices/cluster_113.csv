1851,Mid Century Space Age Celestial Globe - Denoyer Geppert - Circa 1956 - TREASURY PICK,"
            This is a mid century modern celestial globe measuring 16 inches in diameter and produced by Denoyer-Geppert in 1956.
The globe contains a calibrated brass full meridian and the piece stands 22 1/2 inches tall. The globe is mounted on a beautiful and functional wooden cradle table stand with a horizontal horizon ring around the top of the cradle depicting seasons, months and, and astrological representations. 
Six different star magnitudes are identified and are shown in graduated size according to brightness. The piece also depicts star clusters and nebulae as well as significant constellations. 
The condition of the globe is fantastic. The piece spins smoothly and forcefully and the colors are bright and vibrant. The piece has signs of staining on the wooden cradle which I have tried to capture in the listing pictures, as well as slight yellowing along the globe gores.
This globe is a fascinating example of mid-century design and space age fascination. It is a highly collectible item, and would make an amazing teaching tool and incredible display piece in nearly any setting.        ","1,100.00",4.8889,"Vintage item from the 1950s

2274,Sleek Antonio Pineda Sterling Silver 970 Cufflinks Modernist Taxco,"
            Fine pair of modernist sterling silver cufflinks by Antonio Pineda, Taxco, Mexico ca. 1955-1965.  These cufflinks feature clean modernist lines that unlike any are still very relevant today.  The design is cut into heavy 970/1000 oxidized silver.  One cufflink is stamped ""HECHO EN MEXICO"" and the Eagle 3.   and the other is stamped with the ANTONIO TAXCO crown and ""970"".  and SILVER.  These are heavy (18.4 grams) and elegant toggle back  cufflinks suitable for a graduation, anniversary, wedding or other important gift.  Condition is very good with the most minor surface scratching (appears less than in the photos) and wear as shown.  Some exceedingly minor bending of the posts could be brought true by a jeweler if needed.  Seems to be a rare design.  At the time of this writing, this is the only one of this design available and while they are probably out there, I see no other historical examples.
Dimensions: 14.5mm x 23.5mm.  Questions welcomed and answered.

8603,"St. Jerome, Patron of Librarians, Book Lovers, Scholars: Handmade Statue","
            I carve the original in clay and cast the statues by hand in our workshop in Natchez, Mississippi. Statues come boxed, can go outside, come with a history card, and can stand or hang. The card states the following:
Born in what is now Croatia, Jerome (ca. 345-420) became a monk around the age of 25. After a dream in which he was told he was not Christian enough, he moved to the Syrian desert to become a hermit. The desert hermits were a group of men, and a few women, who lived focused on extreme physical austerity but spiritual abundance: the sayings of these men are among the most pithy statements of the essence of Christianity. Jerome went to the desert like others, with the intention of abandoning attachment to certain things so that he might embrace All, but he could not detach himself from learning: while others took nothing but rags with them to the desert, Jerome brought his library. For this, and other reasons, he is the patron of book lovers, librarians, and scholars. In the desert, Jerome taught himself Hebrew (he already knew Greek) so that he could be closer to the original languages of the Bible. After four or five years in the desert, he returned to Rome, where Pope Damasus asked him to take on an immense task: to translate the entire Bible into Latin. Working from the Hebrew of the Old Testament and the original Greek version of the New Testament, Jerome spent the rest of his life on the project, a work (the Vulgate) of almost unimaginable breadth. (For this he is the patron of translators.) Besides his scholarship, Jerome was a ferocious social critic, especially when it came to the lives of fellow clergy.  He wrote to a bishop known for his escapades with nuns: “You load your fingers with rings, you arrange the stray hairs on your brown skull to the best advantage. Your bull’s neck bulges out with fat and droops no whit because it has given way to lust.” He can go on with this invective for pages. Finally, Jerome is often depicted, as here, with a lion. The story is that a lion one day limped into the monastery where Jerome was at work. Other monks fled. Jerome, lion-like himself, stayed calm. The lion handed Jerome its paw. Jerome withdrew a thorn. For the rest of its life, the lion protected the scholar. This story is the reason that statues of lions often appear before libraries: those are Jerome’s lions. This small statue of Jerome was handmade by Hank Schlau and handpainted by Karen Schlau.

Wood, like all natural materials, has inherent disparities in color and grain pattern. Because of variations caused by nature, over which the company has no control, we do our best to match the finish and grain examples shown in our pictures, but cannot guarantee an exact match to the pictures provided due to the natural variation of the wood. Each piece will have a variation in how it accepts the finishing process.

10665,"Vintage Record Album Storage Binder, Includes Nine 1950s era Records, Rare King Cole Trio, Eddie Fisher, Liberace and More","
            Here we have a set of nine 1950s era 78 albums stored inside a very cool record album storage binder. This is a party waiting to happen, ladies and gentlemen. Just look at the incredible music contained in this one listing: 
1) King Cole Trio, My Lips Remember Your Kisses / F.S.T. (Instrumental), Premier label. This one is hard to find on this label.
2) Eddie Fisher, Even Now / If It Were Up To Me, RCA Victor
3) Liberace, 12th Street Rag / Beer Barrel Polka, Columbia Records
4) The Ames Brothers, Once Upon a Tune / You You You, RCA Victor
5) The Gaylords, Tell Me You're Mine / Cuban Love Song, Mercury
6) Dude Martin and his Roundup Gang, It Wouldn't Be The Same Without You / If You Want Some Lovin'
7) Percy Faith and his Orchestra, Delicado / Festival, Columbia 
8) Hugo Winterhalter and his Orchestra, Blue Violins / Fandango, RCA Victor
9) Richard Hayes, Once / Out in the Cold Again, Mercury
The storage binder itself is not too shabby either. It's a deep red color with an embossed record album and musical notes on the cover. Inside, there is a record index (no writing) and 10 sleeves to hold 10"" 78's. Some wear and tear on the front and spine.
Condition: I do not have anyway to test the records themselves. However, I've gone through each one and don't see any deep scratches. The King Cole Trio appears to have the most use - see fourth picture; there are two scratches that I can feel, but they aren't very deep. 
The Dude Martin album has what looks to be very small pitting - I can see them, but I can't feel them. 
All the labels themselves are in excellent condition except for the Percy Faith one - see the last picture. The album itself looks ok. 
I do have more pictures of the 78's and the storage binder: convo me if you'd like to see something specific.
Measurements: Storage binder measures 12"" (30 1/2) x 10 1/4"" (26 cm) x 1 1/2"" (4 cm).

Japanese 1 Sen Coin Ring w/Black nanoceramic:
- Glowing Bronze Coin Ring
- Your choice of Nano Ceramic Color. (see the second photo)
- Comes in a cute box ready for gift giving.
- Made to order, just for you.
These rings are handcrafted using a bronze Japanese One Sen Coin.  Issued from 1916 -1938 they feature a beautiful vine and cherry blossom design that will be on the outside of the ring.  The inside of the ring features the date and issuing authority in Japanese script.  You can see the coin these are made from in the third photo.
Each ring has a black nanoceramic coating applied to the inside and outside of the ring.  I then remove a portion of the coating from the outside to highlight the beauty of the coin.  Finally I coat the ring in a clear ceramic.  Bronze has enough copper in it that untreated metal can be reactive to skin, so I have chosen to apply the nano ceramic on the ring in a way that will prevent the the possibility of harmless ""green finger"".  The nanoceramic will wear off over time, however I offer free replating of the ring as needed just pay postage.
I offer Size 4-10  for this ring, if you would like  smaller size or a larger size please send me message so that we can get you your perfect ring.   Smaller rings will be more rounded and larger rings will be more straight sided and the details a bit more stretched.  The coins in the photos are size 6-8

            These hand knit and felted wool shoes will be your favorite footwear! The natural properties of wool make them warm in the winter and cool in the summer. You will look forward to slipping them on at the end of the day.

It will take about 30-40 days for them to be finished. If you need a pair rushed for a gift let me know and I can try to have them ready faster.

I wear this type of wool shoe year round and love them! They do have a wool sole so they are best suited to house and yard wear. 
***New*** Optional natural latex sole! I can add a natural latex sole which will be non slip and make your wool shoes wearable outside. This is a product that comes in liquid form and I add layers of it to the sole of the shoe. If you'd like this I charge 5 to add it to the wool shoes. To make it easier for my customers I have now created a separate listing for the non slip soles.  Here's the link:

Hand stamping is a process where each letter is individually stamped into the metal. As such, each letter may not line up perfectly and some letters may be deeper than the others. This is not to be considered a defect and adds to the charm of each piece. This process is much deeper than engraving.        ",27.00,4.7654,"Handmade item
