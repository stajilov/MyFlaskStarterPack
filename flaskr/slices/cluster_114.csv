2422,"Vintage Glass Cabochons - 13mm Round White, Black And Gold Deco Design (choose 2 pc or 4 pc)","
            These vintage glass cabochons were manufactured in West Germany, from the 1950's through the 1970's. The stones measure 13mm each, and the colors are metallic gold and black on a white base. As you can see from the last photo, I carry this style in a variety of sizes and colors; the design is incredibly versatile, and it's lots of fun to mix and match the different colors and sizes.
The back sides have a small round impression, which makes me suspect that these were originally designed for hat pins. Just to be very clear, the impression is not a hole (it does not go all the way through) these are flat backed cabochons, suited for gluing, mounting or bezeling; they are not beads.
Size = 13 mm

2677,Vintage Oxidized Brass Flower Findings 17mm,"
            This is for a lot of 4 vintage oxidized brass flower findings. Measures approximately 17mm diameter. These were originally made to be riveted. If you have the right rivet gun you can easily stack and layer these. If not you can do like I do and glue them together with an epoxy glue such as E6000, then clamp for 24 hours. Oxidation varies, so the color may slightly vary. Perfect for making pendants, bracelet centerpieces and collage. New/old stock.
The last picture shows these larger findings stacked with similar but smaller findings. You can find the smaller findings here

            Large Vintage Rhinestone Clasp - 34x19 - 1-3 Strand Necklace Floral Flower Rhinestone Clasp - Gorgeous - 1PC
I found these on my 2015 NYC trip =) I LOVE these vintage rhinestone clasps. Each of these clasps are heavy and extremely well constructed. They are plated in Rhodium and will go with any bright silver finish or custom project. This beautiful clasp can accommodate up to 3 strands but could easily be modified or used for 1-2 or 3 strand projects =)
I am very selective when I buy vintage stones/rhinestones. You can easily end up with junk, as I did when I first started buying from another etsy seller. The stones, if not properly cared for and stored will loose their foil, get chipped up and most notably, get scratched beyond use. While 90% of my inventory is vintage and I had no control over who had it before me, I am still very selective in what I send out. Now, with that being said...some of the stones were manufactured in the 30's and their age is part of their charm.
Each year I journey all over in search of the finest and rarest of stones. I hunt through many warehouses and PILES of GOOD vintage searching for unique jewelry findings, vintage Swarovski Crystal rhinestone chatons and other out of production vintage goodies for not only myself but for many others as well. I have only recently brought my obsession to Etsy where I will be offering some great vintage rhinestones, cabochons and jewelry findings. This year will be my first year visiting France to go hunting and I will be sure to bring enough back to share with you too!
I generally ship within a day or two of your order =)

5491,Gorgeous Vintage Ladies French Kid Leather Gloves. Made for 'Miller Andersons'. Size 7. Faux Broderie Anglaise Frill.,"
            These gloves are beautiful.
Soft kid leather in a caramel/tan color. Exquisite detail. Appear not to have been worn.
There is a stitched detail to the top of the hand - the stitches are like little 'arrows'.
At the wrist there is a beautiful 'frill' with a scalloped edge. The scallops are minutely 'pinked' (as in the effect from pinking shears). There are tiny round 'holes' which are highlighted by the gorgeous cream kid of the lining. The whole design is to give the effect of broderie anglaise. So feminine!
Beautifully made without any flaws or marks. 
These are marked size 7. If they are to be worn, I would advise that it looks like the fit is for a very slender wrist  with long and slender fingers.        ",50.51,4.9697,"Vintage item from the 1960s

6672,Pipe Floor Lamp 4-fixture Living Room Steampunk Mason Jar DOES NOT Include Bulbs,"
            ON SALE THROUGH April 30th --- REGULARLY 219.  This lamp DOES NOT Include Bulbs. 
My Etsy shop listing for this lamp that includes 4 bulbs is: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/384918640/pipe-floor-lamp-includes-4-bulbs-4?ref=shop_home_active_3
  
I make my Edison Age vintage industrial fixtures using brand new parts: black steel pipe/couplings/fittings, red-handled gate valve (Decorative Only -- not an on/off switch) and retro Mason Jars, This lamp is truly a blend of rugged materials/craftsmanship and beautiful, functional design -- photos do NOT do it justice! Kindly read my Etsy customer reviews --- my clients absolutely Love their lamps, as will you :)
FAQ's
I've been doing this for a while now and have shipped a lot of lamps (plus a lot of local pick-ups in Southern California) and I now know how the questions roll and how to most effectively handle custom lamp requests, orders and purchases, both for my clients and myself:
* The lamp Fixtures can be rotated upon delivery in other angles to face sideways or turned upside down (please see my 3-fixture Floor Lamp listing on my shop that depicts the fixtures rotated in different angles).
* Lamp cord has on/off switch. I can provide the lamp without the gate valve if requested, or paint the red-handled gate valve Black or White for 5 charge (I don't offer option of a Dimmer switch, as the available parts on the market are way too unreliable).
* The sockets receive standard-sized bulbs up to 60 watts, including standard household bulbs; you may certainly use or purchase your own bulbs separately.
*  I have available Edison Vintage bulbs for sale 8 each as a one-time convenience item to be included with purchased lamp & fixture shipments (I pack them carefully, but should a purchased bulb get broken in shipping, I'll credit you back the price via PayPal). 
THIS LAMP DOES NOT INCLUDE LIGHT BULBS. MY 4-FIXTURE LAMP WITH 4 BULBS INCLUDED IS LISTED AS A SEPARATE LISTING ON MY ETSY SHOP.
* I make the lamps out of black steel industrial pipe. The pipe can't be painted a different color. I can make the lamp in galvenized pipe for an additional 95 charge for parts, allow an extra week to ship.
* I can modify the base configuration for 20 -- 35 charge depending on what you want done.
* That's basically the extent of the customizing I'm doing on the lamps. I am no longer ""matching"" photos of other lamps or making significant modifications on my standard lamps. Thank you.
* If we end up configuring your lamp with custom modification, I'll get your zip code, determine your shipping costs and give you final shipped price. Purchase will be done directly through my PayPal account, which is  thomarchbold [!at] gmail.com. You'll still have full PayPal buyer protection as if buying through Etsy --- this just enables us to do a custom pricing purchase for you, separate from my standard Etsy listing and price.
* Shipping can be USPS Standard Retail or Priority. I pack the lamps and components very carefully, double-walled, boxes, corrugated and bubble wrap dividers between items, double bubble packed wrapping fragile fixtures and components, etc.
* IF ARE 99% SURE YOU'RE READY TO PLACE YOUR ORDER IN NEXT 1-2 DAYS & NEED CUSTOM LAMP PRICING (or have some question NOT answered in  the FAQ's) PLEASE CONTACT ME VIA CONVO/E-MAIL OR BY PHONE. Please Include your zip code (so I can determine shipping). I'll get your custom lamp shipped pricing back to you immediately, we'll do PayPal transaction to me & I'll get going making your lamp  :)  When I see your convo come in, I'll know you're 99% ready to order and I 100% guarantee that I'll reply within either the same business day (Pacific Time) or within 1st two hours of following morning. Promise!
When you open the box and see your lamp you'll immediately love it's dynamic energy and how it complements your home or office, injecting a super-cool dynamic and literally upgrading & transforming  your space.
PLEASE NOTE: Edison vintage 60 watt light bulbs sold separately on my Etsy Shop, 8 each, free shipping with the lamp. The vintage bulb is easy for anyone to change. Maximum 4 bulbs per order  (I only provide these as a convenience, to ship with lamp purchases -- I can't sell or ship bulbs separately).
Epitomizes the genre with unique fusion of antique style industrial parts and contemporary craftsmanship. Looks as though it was taken straight from an early American factory, only with modern electrical parts. Very sturdy and durable.
Specifications : Height 69'' inches
Base 12'' x 12'' inches
Shipped weight: 23 lbs
Shipping & Packing: This a heavy (and fragile) item and -- even shipping via USPS -- the Postal Service shipping fees are what they are. I spend about 40 minutes per lamp with high quality packaging materials carefully wrapping each fixture, Mason Jar, and the lamp body and base, securing all within the box to ensure safe arrival to you, 
Thank you So Much for looking ---  I very much look forward to working with you!

            Certified Organic Chamomile Flowers. 
PLEASE NOTE: Quantity available refers to OUNCES on hand.
This pretty little yellow flower has a sweet apple-like fragrance that is most pleasing and relaxing to the senses. The pale golden-yellow oil infusion of the flowers is wonderful in conditioning body oils, salves, and balms to treat skin that is sensitive or inflamed. Chamomile is very gentle, so it is excellent for use in formulas for children and the elderly. 
Chamomile tea has very calming, relaxing properties that make it a wonderful beverage to use in the evening prior to sleep. Just put 1 teaspoon into a tea infuser, add very hot water, allow to steep for 3-5 minutes. Add a little stevia or honey if desired. 
I also have for sale, fill your own tea bags. These work wonderfully with this herb. Just heat seal and you can create your own specialty tea blends!

I am now offering 3 sizes for our soaps
you can choose:
1 oz. sample size
A half bar (2.5 oz.)
or Full size bar (5 oz.)
I have taken two very soothing ingredients: therapeutic grade lavender essential oil and fresh ground oats to make this wonderful artisan bar. Perfect for tired skin. Fill the tub and scrub away with this wonderful natural soap.
Made with natural ingredients and nourishing oils, coconut, olive, and grape seed oil from France which is high in Vitamin E, so wonderful for the skin. We also use therapeutic grade lavender oil.
Down a little dirt road sits a little farm nestled against the woods. That is where Four Sisters Farm soap is made, with a Mama and four sisters. Our soap is made in small batches right here on our farm, with love and care.
Our soap is vegan friendly.
PLEASE NOTE: As our soaps are handmade each batch can turn out looking differently, so each batch will vary slightly from the last. Also note that since we use no sythetics in our soaps they are not scented with fragrance oils, they are scented with therapeutic grade essential oils which is a MUCH lighter scent. If you are expecting a super strong scent you will not find that with our soaps. Those that like a lighter scented bar will enjoy our completely natural soaps. Some essential oils are stronger than others. 
To ensure the longevity of your soap bar it is so important to keep it out of your showers stream or puddles of water. A well draining soap dish will make your bar last a long time. We highly recommend our cedar wood soap decks, we keep one at the bathroom sink, kitchen sink and at the side of the tub/shower.

            Handwoven Ukulele Strap/ Mandolin Strap/Dulcimer Strap 
 Inkle weaving, is an ancient form of weaving that is used for belts, straps, bands,trim, bookmarks etc. creating a strong and durable textile. The strap does not stretch or require backing, making an Inkle woven strap an ideal choice (and comfortable) for a Ukulele strap or other smaller stringed instrument.
Bordered in navy blue with a central pattern of cayenne, light powder blue and navy. Woven in a ""pick-up"" pattern, a more time consuming process than a plain weave.
Option A
No strap buttons? No problem. Choose the adjustable neck strap with a J hook that hooks over the sound hole of your ukulele and slide adjuster to adjust the length. The length of handwoven textile is 48 inches long (125 cm)
Larger J hook :for larger ukuleles ,best suited for a concert, tenor or  bass ukulele.  
Small J Hook: for smaller ukuleles, best for soprano or concert 
Option B
For an instrument with one or two strap buttons.   
The leather ends are handmade and you have a choice of black,tan or brown leather. A further choice of nickel or black acetate tab rings. The leather tabs fit snugly over the strap buttons.  A matching leather headstock strap holder is included  in this option. The one inch (2.5 cm) wide strap is adjustable with a maximum length of 52 inches (132 cm) (including the leather cut ends) and a minimum of 35 inches (89 cm).  
Option C (leave a message in buyers notes if this is for a banjo ukulele)
Banjo ukulele: with banjo strap adapters. Same as option but B with banjo strap adapters.
