Crazy Horse distressed leather is one of the most unique and expensive leathers for applying special handmade waxes to surface of the leather. Rubbed it will change it’s color and will give it an antique look, this allows us to make you a brand new item, that will (with little effort on your part) be made to look like an scuffed-up, old, family heirloom.
Crazy Horse leather absorb the oils from your hands and this natural process will cause the leather to form a patina over time (glossy layer that will make the leather look even better)
All leather specially treated with natural wax. This is the reason why the leather does not absorb water.

1711,Vintage Mid Century Modern Silver Craft Plush Green Velvet Swivel Club Chair,"
            In 1973 the color of this chair was considered 'neutral' and was seen on everything from appliances to living room furniture (right along with 'Harvest Gold').  Although our idea of a neutral color may be slightly different today, our idea of what constitutes a quality piece of furniture remains unchanged.  Silver Craft understood the importance of quality manufacturing, as seen in this tufted plush green swivel club chair on a black plinth base.  And while it may not be a neutral, it is extraordinarily comfortable!

4298,Vintage Isabella Fiore Quality Woven Leather and Fiber Bag with Leather Accent ~ Leather Pine Cones,"
            This Isabella Fiore bag is so unique that it is hard to describe...it is in the general shape of a wide hobo, with beautifully woven deep reddish brown and chocolate brown nylon fibers and supple chocolate brown leather making up the body.  The gusseted sides and bottom of the bag is made of wonderfully supple chocolate brown leather and supported with a leather and brass strap at each corner.  There are plenty of stylish adornments as well.  The sturdy woven leather strap is backed with soft leather for comfort and attached to the bag with two large bronzed grommets and ring attachments.  But the thing that is most noticeable on this bag is the two large 2 3/4"" long pinecones made of leather that hang from the zipper pull!  
The interior is entirely made of  heavy quality brown canvas with leather trim.  There is a metal plate affixed to a large zipper pocket on one side that proclaims ""Isabella Fiore"" as the maker, and 3 upright slip pockets on the other wall.  The interior measures 9 inches in depth, 17 inches across and 3 3/4 inches wide.
Overall measurements:  Across top from strap to strap: 17 inches; Depth from strap to bottom: 11 inches; Width at widest point: 3 3/4 inches; Strap: 18 inches, which affords a 6 inch drop.
This would make a great ""anywhere bag"" for your personal use, or an enviable addition to your vintage collection.

5196,ANTIQUE FRENCH FABRIC - Floral printed fabric panel from the 19th century,"
            THIS ITEM IS RESERVED FOR VICKI - PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE!!!
This fabric panel came from a great big family house owned by friends in Dordogne. One of the room had curtains and walls upholstered in ""Indienne"" fabric and this particular piece had been used for a window treatment, a pique with a repetitive pattern of either foliage and flowers. It is late 19th century.
It is a medium weight fabric with a lovely knobby texture that is not without reminding me of American Bark cloth. The background is a faded golden putty color and the patterns are in shades of off white, various pinks and baby blue. 
The condition is very good. Please keep in mind that this fabric was previously used.
This particular panel is 52"" L x 33"" W. The overall size is actually 62"" but there is an old ink stain pass the 52"", smack in the middle of the panel.

5911,ANTIQUE LACE COLLAR - Large French black lace and bullion collar from the late 1800's,"
            This spectacular black lace collar dates back to 1880-1890 and comes from France. 
This is a particularly large collar designed, using two sizes of background lace. Nine oval medallions with stemming leaves are spread along the length of the collar, surrounded with a raised scalloped border. The areas  linking the medallions have their own design, resembling large upside down flowers in the back. The edges of the collar towards the front consist of scalloped lace trim, and the pointed ends are adorned with three decorative scrolls. All the designs are made out of rises bullion work.
The lace in the medallions is extremely fine, and as expected for an item that was worn from that time period, there are missing small sections , or little holes, in some areas of the finer lace. The larger woven lace is missing from some of the bigger fields on the back on one side . I suspect the damage was due to too much friction and rubbing in these areas which correspond to were the shoulders are. I am gladly enclosing a 10'' long piece of lace (seen in the last photograph) if you need to make repairs, but when placed on a dark or black fabric, the missing lace seemingly disappears.
The inside length of the collar is 38"". The height of the lace in the center of the back is 5 1/8"" high and the front lace panels are 4"" wide each.        ",100.00,4.95,"Vintage item from the 1800s

            Peaks on Peaks on Peaks.
This was my original idea for the implied mountain shelves and am so very happy to offer it now! There are two equilateral triangles stacked one on top of another to create a nice shadow box. Finished in Mahogany stain and easy to hang, this will add the perfect amount of charm to any wall. There's plenty of space to fit trinkets, collectibles, vintage tins, and photos on each shelf.
Measurements:
20 1/4"" wide
20 1/2"" tall
3.5"" deep
If you want it finished in another color please just leave me a note!
If you're interested in commission work, custom orders, different lengths, sizes, or bulk orders please message me!
Note: 
All wood is inspected before purchasing for deeps cuts, straightness, gouges, etc., but some imperfections in the wood will still be present. Knots, small chips, and different areas of color are all part of the process and only adds to the charm of the products in my shop.
All shelves are ready to hang and including mounting hardware. Just unwrap and decided where it's going to hang! I recommend anchor screws in drywall or secure to a stud. Thumb tacks are ok, but don't think it will hold them up and wouldn't want your shelf to fall!
FAQ
1. Do the shelves come with hooks to hang? Yes! All hooks are ready to hang with no work or assembly to do!
2. How heavy are the shelves? Typically, most shelves are 6-7 pounds and light enough to be hung my nails, screws, or my personal favorite, wall anchors available at most hardware and home improvement stores. 
3. I have a custom size I want, how should I proceed? Please send me an email and I can give you quote for a different size! Typically not much more than the original price.
4. If I ordered more than one item, can shipping be combine? I try to make shipping cost low and will do my best to keep it that way. Please email me and we can work something out. Usually a coupon code of some sort!        ",90.00,4.9516,"Handmade item

            I offer a flat rate of £3.95 p&p (2nd Class recorded) with no extra charge for additional items, shipping upgrades available at checkout.
Who doesn't love a little delicate, fragrant waft of natural perfume every now and again?
The scents are inspired by the beautiful essential oil blends in our Limited Edition Soap range, as well as some all time favourites of ours from our bathing range.
The wonderful blend of oils, butters and our own Northumbrian Beeswax in these dinky little wonder pots are just waiting to be stroked on to wrists, collar bones, backs of knees...whereever you want to give a delicate fragrance and a little added softness.
Apply as often as needed with the fingertips.
 
 Choose from the following pure essential oil fragrance blends:
Restful Slumber - Our all time favourite sleepy blend of Sweet Lavender, sharp yet vibrant Bergamot & hauntingly beautiful Neroli oils, stroke on to temples and wrists to help induce a sense of deep calm and relaxation in preparation for a good night's sleep.
Rose Madder - Think of exotic jewel coloured medina's, their lush, cool courtyards, incense smoke curling up to the darkening sky. The corners are piled high with plucked magenta rose blooms drying in the last rays of summer. 'Queen of the Night' flowering jasmine and bright cerise Bougainvillea climb the crumbling stone walls perfuming the air with an intoxicating, heady floral aroma...
Lemon Cream - A pile of fresh Sicilian lemons, sherberty and zesty may chang and rich and sweet creamy vanilla notes from resinous benzoin. Imagine homemade lemonade, and a creamy bowl of meltingly luxurious dairy ice cream, sprinkled with candied lemon peel and sherbet, eaten in the late afternoon sun, under a canopy of vine leaves fringed with gold.
Sweet Orange Floral - Blends of sweet juicy citrus fruits and night flowering jasmine. An ethereal and beautiful yet delicate scent. 
Lavender, Ylang ylang and Patchouli - Sweetly floral and heady Ylang ylang blended beautifully with sharp herbal lavender and the warm earthy notes of dark Indian patchouli oils give this one a distinctive scent that you'll keep reaching for, perhaps my favourite.

            Story:
My kids and I were spending our summer vacation at the countryhouse, when I decided to create a tepee for my lovely babies. 
I posted the result on Instagram and all of my followers loved it. My friends started begging me to make another one for their children. 
Shortly, I started to receive orders from all over the world. This is how making tepees became my hobby that soon turned into a profitable business.
About:
With our tepee your kids can play history games or invent many different activities of their own, We will provide you with the assembly guide, however, the installation is a piece of cake - it won't take you more than a few seconds to fold and unfold the tent.

- pocket on the back side;
- window on the right side;
- flags at the top;
- poles.

            Now Celebrating my 15th Year!!
I am the originator of the foil faced Hellraiser Puzzle Boxes.  
This puzzle box is inspired from the movie Hellraiser. All 6 face designs are based on scans from an actual movie prop, so no detail will be overlooked. This non-working puzzle box replica is made of solid wood and measures 3 inches per side. The highly detailed face panels are made with a shiny smooth gold metallic foil (not etched brass). The face designs are also professionally laminated to protect the designs from scratches.

10995,Hasbro Black Series Force FX Luke Skywalker's Lightsaber Conversion Kit,"
            Do you own a Hasbro Black Series Luke's Lightsaber and wish you could remove the blade or smash it with your friends? Well, you probably need to convert it. And you will need a proper metal blade holder to do so!
This is an aluminum blade holder that is a substitution to the original plastic blade holder. You're gonna need to buy a LED module separately, but this should work with any 1"" LED module out there with some work. If you are a sabersmith with experiences in Lightsaber conversion, you will find it very easy and straightforward to use this kit.
The 10-32 Tap option is to be selected if you are planning to buy the blade holder together with the Graflex Thumbscrews sold in my shop. You can choose the M3 (Normal) option if you want to re-tap the thread to 10-32 by yourself.
For how-to and more details, you can join the discussion about this kit in this IRA forum: http://imperialroyalarms.proboards.com/thread/7205/hasbro-black-series-lukes-conversion
Your item will be shipped with Thailand Post track & signed standard international shipping. If you live in the US, it should take around 13-21 days to be delivered. However, if you order at least 50 of this, your items will be shipped with Express Mail Service which should take around 4-7 days to be delivered. You can trace your package via Thailand Post website 'http://track.thailandpost.co.th/tracking/default.aspx?lang=en' and when the package leaves the country, you will have to trace the item on your local post website using the same tracking number. For the ease of use, I recommend you to track your package using this website 'http://www.track-trace.com/post' and select your country from the list.
And last but not least, I would like to say that I very much appreciated your interests. And may the force be with you!

Mahri Swan Wooten on Oct 10, 2016
5 out of 5 stars     
Olivia is simply amazing.... so artistic and loving.... It is more than ""just a bag"". It's the experience of creating something special. I had so much fun chatting with her and being an intimate part of the creative process. Your bag will truly be one of a kind. No two are exactly the same. A great gift for someone you love and care about. I will definitely order more in the future.        ",38.00,4.95,"Handmade item

14570,"Clam shell seashell mold for cake decorating or polymer clay, beach cakes, gumpaste shell mold, fondant shell mold. M33","
            This is a clam shell seashell mold, it's a little over 2"" tall and about 2"" wide. It can be used for beach cakes, wedding favors, polymer clay and isomalt.
The silicone that I use for these molds is food safe and can be used for gumpaste, fondant, chocolate and sugar. If you use it for non-food purposes don't use it for food too!
I like this individual mold because it's easier to get the shells out without losing the detail on them. Some other multiple-cavity molds that I've used result in flat spots when you push the gumpaste out of the mold, but with this type of silicone it's easier to get the shell out without ruining the detail on it. 
I like this clam shell because it's got such a nice texture on the shell itself. You'll see the detail when you brush it with petal dusts or paint it with food coloring to give it a realistic look. These molds work best with gumpaste or a stiff fondant. Soft fondant won't work in the molds because it will stretch when it's removed and lose the shape and details.

15600,"Universal Stabilizing MEGA FOLDING CONE made of Stainless Steel for all 1/4"" inch – 3/4"" inch Holes in Coin Rings","
            This MEGA folding cone can now begin and fully fold over any size coin, round, token or medallion with as small as a 1/4"" inch center-punched hole up to as large as a 3/4” center-punched hole. (Common hole sizes that can be accommodated are: 1/4"", 3/8"", 7/16"", 1/2"", 9/16"", 5/8"", and 3/4"").
This tool is another option for those that use an arbor press or a hydraulic press when folding their coin rings.
(NOTE): This tool will NOT work with any ring sizing machines, as there is not enough clearance that's needed. 
* Made from wear resistant and hardened stainless steel, there’s no more chewed up and worn out plastic folding cones or plastic bearing balls to worry about! 
Here are some reviews that I've received about this tool:
    
""A galaxy of stars wouldn't be enough to select from to reflect in how pleased I am with these new tools. Precision dies and cones and mandrel's epic quality and speedy shipping. I will continue to buy for sure.""
      Eric Guthrie on Apr 11, 2017
      5 out of 5 stars 
   
--- ""This works so much better than the plastic-ish cone I have. Additionally it doesn't wear out and the coin doesn't get stuck on it.""
       Chris Jones on Mar 9, 2017
       5 out of 5 stars
     
--- ""Delivered quick, great guy to work with, very professional and excellent cone to use for coin ring making.""

* MAKE SURE TO WRAP THE MEGA FOLDING CONE WITH PIPE THREAD TAPE PRIOR TO USE TO PROTECT YOUR COIN RINGS’ INNER DETAIL WHILE FOLDING! 
* To use, simply set the coin level into the appropriate-size reduction die, then insert the mega folding cone into the center punched hole to begin folding the coin down into the die. 
MAKE SURE TO USE SEVERAL SHORT STROKES WHILE FOLDING; STOPPING OFTEN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR COIN IS LEVEL IN THE REDUCTION DIE. 
The more you fold the coin, the smaller it will become; so you will need to switch to a smaller inner diameter-sized universal reduction die. You continue this process until the sides of the mega folding cone are almost touching the inner portion of your coin. Once that occurs, you have completed the folding process. 
* * * TIPS * * * 
1.)  I like to have the universal reduction die that I am using stacked on top of either the reducing wheel plate from my ring sizer machine or the arbor wheel plate for better stability, (see listing photos for reference.) That way, there’s enough clearance for the long folding cone to go through without interference. 
2.) You should still bevel (round out) the sharp edges of the hole in your coin BEFORE using this long folding cone, to make sure that there are no micro tears present that can cause your coin to split. (This is best accomplished with a “deburring tool” that can be purchased online.) 
3.) I like to wrap the mega folding cone with pipe thread tape a few times around, making sure to wrap evenly and to overlap at least half the width of the previous tapes' wrap. Some coins will need more tape, some will need less. I recommend folding over a few clad (non-silver) coins at first for practice.
4.) Make sure to anneal (heat & quench) the coin often to keep the metal in a softer state; as this will make the folding process go smoother with less effort.
This mega folding cone also works great with my set of 2 “Stabilizer” Reduction Dies, as you end up having twice the stability of both the design of the die itself and the long folding cone when folding over any US Quarter, US Half Dollar, Morgan/Peace Dollar, or the American Silver Eagle.
(Coins and coin rings pictured are not included and are meant for reference only).
*** Here’s why you should purchase this folding tool from the CoinRingUSA Shop:
1. Wear-resistant and hardened stainless steel is used. Each mega folding cone is CNC machined and hand-worked by expert machinists.
2. My customers always come first! I can always be reached through Etsy, by e-mail directly, or by leaving me a comment on my blog site. 
3. The level of quality of my tools is not duplicated elsewhere. 
4. The optimal degree of angle is used on this long folding cone to achieve the best results when folding your coins.
5. I have a passion for both making coin rings as well as creating the highest quality coin ring-making tools on the market today. That's why I've created a platform where people can go to get their questions answered about all things coin rings; as well as ask questions and even leave suggestions. Please visit my new blog site at: www.CoinRingBlog.com for coin ring making tips, tricks, and tool updates. 
6. All of my tools are 100% guaranteed 
7. Why pay a little less for inferior tools? Buy from CoinRingUSA and get the best!
*** SAFETY FIRST ***
--- Always wear safety glasses.
--- Keep fingers, long hair, and loose clothing away from any pinch points or open flame.
--- Make sure to anneal, (heat, then quench) the coin often as you're working it.

18868,"Custom White Nike ""GUCCI"" Huaraches, Gucci Huarache, Nike Gucci, Nike Huarache Gucci,","
            These are custom shoes that are Gucci inspired, and are hand crafted by me. These are iconic for its resemblance to the famous brand Gucci. The Gucci inspired Huaraches has multiple coats of green and red for lasting color and won't fade or crack. 
Huaraches run a little tight so it is recommended to order a half size up. 
*BEFORE ORDERING* you pick your gender and then choose your size. It shows each size as men *BUT IT IS NOT* I can not remove the word Men next to all sizes, Simply just choice male or female and your normal size and if your are women which ever size you pick it will be FEMALE and if you are male choice male and you will get a MALE size. Sorry for this inconvenience. 
*CAUTION* These shoes are not waterproof but they are water repellent. What that means is that if the shoe gets a little wet or gets drizzled on them it should be fine. BUT if it gets drenched in water there is a possiblity of some paint streaking. So if you're pair of kicks get drenched and the paint streaks, I am not responsible for any damage.
Turnaround Time:
To find out the time required before we can have your shoes shipped out, you must click the ""Shipping & Policies"" tab. The time will vary depending on how many orders we have currently pending. If the wait time is not acceptable, please do not purchase without contacting us first.
It is very important that all buyers read the tab so they're aware of the wait time. Complaints of the wait time is not acceptable after purchase. 
Care for shoes:
With all customs, they should be taken care of. You can surely wear them on a daily basis but scraping, scratching or prying at the art work will damage the shoes. If the shoes happen to get dirty, we recommend gently wiping the shoes with a towel or rag. 
Custom Requests:
If you have a design or concept you'd like created, feel free to contact us and we'll see if it's possible. We're not limited to only working on this design.
Returns:
We do not accept returns on custom orders. All sales are final. The images we provide is a close representation of what you should receive.        ",173.99,4.95,"Handmade item

It has an adjustable strap for carrying on your shoulder. It is minimalist, has no lining and internal pocket and for this simplicity you'll love it. 
MATERIAL: Thick natural leather. Minor imperfections and wrinkles confirm the authenticity of the leather.
Dimensions: Inside the bag:  6,5 x 25 x 21 cm. High: 32 cm. Strap  length-adjustable 120 cm (you can change this dimensions, just give me the information before purchase).
CARE: The bag is attached care instructions. By using the given hints you can make your bag will serve you forever. However, if you scratch it accidentally or damage do not despair - so your bag will become an extraordinary nature and will be completely unique. Take care of your leatherbag naturally, but let her enroll your story in itself. It is her most valuable trait.
PERSONALIZATION: A unique gift for you! By placing the order, you get the choice to have your product engraved by laser with a text (for example your initials or your name) or logo etc. This is a great idea especially if you buy bag as a gift for someone else.
