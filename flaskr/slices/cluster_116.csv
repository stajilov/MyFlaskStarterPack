            It's impossible to not immediately fall in love with the gold sparkle & bright colors that come in this custom cake topper and confetti set! We've also made it easy for you to personalize the topper with the name of the person that's celebrating their special day.
• Can I get ""Happy Birthday"" only? • 
Don't worry, we can also easily make the topper only read, ""Happy Birthday"", too! All you have to do is select ""No"" under ""Include custom name?"" field (right above the ""Add to Cart"" button).
• Can I get a different color? • 
The cake topper is made out of gold card stock by default, but we can easily swap that out for another color - please see our last image in the listing for available glitter colors (note that glitter card stock has a solid white backing for stability).
• What does this listing come with? • 
This listing comes with one happy birthday cake topper, and one small bag of multicolored (non-edible) paper confetti. Confetti bag is about 1.5"" wide x 1.5"" tall - see second listing photo above.
Personalized birthday topper measures 5.4"" wide x approximately 5"" tall (although the height has the potential to shift a bit based on the name that's being added).
• How do I add a name to the topper? • 
If you'd like to personalize the topper, no problem! Please make note of the name you'd like in the ""Add an optional note to seller"" field in your cart
Please don't hesitate to send us a message if you have any questions. Thanks so much for stopping by! 🎉        ",8.99,4.9669,"Handmade item

            A gorgeous collection of six tribal copper rings. I love the delicateness of these brass rings, they almost look like golden tattoos on your fingers. They are also adjustable so fit everyone!
Please look after your rings, don't get them wet as copper is a reactive metal and can leave a small green print, because of this i have made these rings as cheap and cheerful a price as possible (just £2.08 each for 6 and £2.00 each for 8!)
Try and not mix them with other jewellery, I will package them with a seal bag, keep them in there to look after them :-)

“Growing up in a family with a proud Peruvian father and beautiful bohemian mother, has meant I have grown up in an environment a little different from most. Exotic objects filled our home, such as giant green snail shells, huge seed pods and ancient pots lining the shelves. There were swirls of bright colours in our Andean textiles covering the walls and furniture and of course the sound of my father playing his pan-pipes drifted through the halls. I have been engulfed in a world of curiosities. 
Subsequently I have been inspired to create my jewellery with vibrant colours and unusual natural products such as porcupine quills, real beetle shells, parrot feathers, snake spines, rough-cut semi precious stones, intriguing symbols and emblems from around the world”
