219,"Mens Weekender Bag, Travel Bag for Men, Canvas Weekender, Mens Travel Bag","
            I put a lot of time working on this weekender bag, but it worth it 1000%. I made it for two main purposes: when I go to gym and when I make short trips over the weekend by plane or by car. There's nothing I would add to make it better. It's perfect. It really is. Light, large enough for as many clothes as you need, but it will still fit as a  cabin luggage, very well structured, with a bottom made of thick leather. On the sides, the two pockets will carry your phone, the wallet or the keys, a book, a map, a kindle, your glasses and a small bottle of water.
This bag is also made of waxed canvas, because there's nothing worst then getting at the hotel with your clothes wet. 
The shades it gets over time make the waxed canvas a special fabric. And because of that, the saddle leather is the high class partner it deserves to have.
Both the waxed canvas and the saddle leather evolve and get better over time. Every scratch is recorded and the marks and the shades will remind you of all the journeys you took, to discover the world and to discover yourself. I see these two materials like a photographic film that captures the present for the future.
To preserve the character of the fabrics and to make them last longer, I waterproofed the leather and the lining. Together with the waxed canvas, they make an amazing weekender bag, ready for a long walk on a rainy day.
The height is aprox. 33 cm/ 13'', the deep is aprox. 28 cm/ 11"" and the length is aprox. 55 cm/ 21.5"".

This is a messenger bag like you've never seen before, made of waxed canvas and saddle leather.  It's perhaps a men's bag, but who am I to tell? Anyone can wear it and the bag will be happy to welcome any laptop up to 15 inch.
I used the finest British waxed canvas to make this messenger bag and I am happy to say I created another extraordinary product. 
The shades it gets over time make the waxed canvas a special fabric. And because of that, the saddle leather is the high class partner it deserves to have. A thick yet delicate leather, ready to support the most important parts of this backpack: the straps, the bottom and the top cover. 
Both the waxed canvas and the saddle leather evolve and get better over time. Every scratch is recorded and the marks and the shades will remind you of all the journeys you took, to discover the world and to discover yourself.

I am not a jeweler nor a gemologist but love vintage and estate jewelry. The information I impart is usually given to me when I acquire each individual piece. Therefore, sometimes I have quite a lot of details and other times very few. I try very hard to be as accurate as possible yet ALL descriptions and/or measurements are approximate. I test all gemstones on a Presidium Gem Tester and it is quite accurate. It cannot determine however whether the actual gemstone is a natural gemstone or a man made gemstone as they both are identical in every way. An accredited Gemologist would be the only individual qualified to do so. Stones such as turquoise, opals etc. do not register on the Presidium.
Please do not judge size from the photos. These are oftentimes enlarged to better show detail.
All pieces are vintage or antique…therefore expect the ring, pendant, 
bracelet, watch etc. to show signs of its age and use.
ANY OFFERS I ACCEPT OR ANY COUNTEROFFERS I MAKE WILL ONLY BE HONORED FOR 24 HOURS (from said offer and/or counteroffer)...AFTER THAT, THEY BECOME NULL AND VOID

3914,Antique Daguerreotype Photo Antique Photograph Tintype Ambrotype Cabinet Card CDV Sixth Plate Full Leather Case Civil War Cabinet Photo,"
            ~Description~ 
Frenchman Louis Daguerre invented the daguerreotype in Paris nearly 180 years ago and marked the beginning of photography as we know it. After it's invention in 1839 the daguerreotype became wildly popular. At the height of its popularity in 1853 there were reportedly 86 studios in New York City alone. 
Their mirror like reflection makes identification easy and each component can help with dating. First a brass cover was placed over the image, which in this case takes what they called a nonpareil shape. This piece was called the ""mat"" and it commonly featured elaborate designs like this in the early 1850's. Initially, a glass sheet would be placed atop the mat and the set would be fixed inside a case but starting in 1847 studios began adding an additional brass cover known as the preserver. This preserver features elaborate designs which again is a trait commonly seen starting in the early 1850's. The case is made of wood and adorned with leather to provide quality protection and presentation. Cases of this type were used exclusively into the mid 1850's until thermoplastic union cases hit the market. 
~Measurements~ 
Length: 3 Inches
Width: .75 Inches
Height: 3.5 Inches 
~Condition~
This piece is in excellent antique condition with very minimal wear. The pictures remain very clear and the other components are undamaged. The case is in great condition with both of the clasps fully functional and the binding still in tact. 
~Section~
Antique photographs are a favorite of ours and if you are as interested in these treasures as we are don't forget to check out the splendid range or daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and tintypes featured here in the shop.

Commentary:
For How-to-Measure:
Bust
▲This is not your bra size
▲Wear a no padded bra(your dress will have a built-in bra)
▲Relax arms at sides
▲Pull tape across the fullest part of the bust
Waist
▲Find the natural waist
▲This is the smallest part of the waist
▲Usually about 1 in. above belly button
▲Keep tape slightly loose to allow for breathing room
Hips
▲Find the widest part of the hips
▲Usually about 7 in. below natural waist
▲Tape should brush across both hipbones
Hollow to Floor
▲Stand straight with feet together 
▲Measure in BARE FEET
▲Begin at the hollow space between the collarbones and pull tape straight down to the floor
▲To fit high heels, I’ll add an extra 5 cm onto custom-sized floor-length dresses and dresses with trains.(If you have special requirement, like you'll wear 10 cm heels, please let me know.)

5. For Time
Tailoring Time: I always need 8-10 business days to make one dress during May to December, and 10-20 business days to make one dress during January to April. More dresses need more time to make.
Shipping Time: 
I always use DHL for shipping, it usually takes 3 or 5 days for shipping to anywhere. I also use DPD to Europe, because it usual without tax, takes 4 or 10 days.
If you need expedited the dress, you should contact with me first, it without extra fee, I will try my best to help you!

I will choose the best way to ship out the package without tax when you receive the package, but I can't make sure to get rid of it, because it depends on the Customs of each Country, I will not offer this duty and I hope you will understand!
As I know color swatch packages will not have duty, packages to Europe shipped by DPD will not have duty, small package for dresses to anywhere will not have duty.

15536,10 lb. Opalescent Scrap Glass -colored stained glass scrap MOSAIC.,"
            This is 10 pounds of opalescent (not see-through) scrap glass in every color of the rainbow by lots of different manufacturers. The boxes usually average more than 10 pounds of glass.
100% RECYCLED/UPCYCLED GLASS FROM OLD STAINED GLASS WINDOWS AND DISCARDS FROM WORKING STUDIOS.
I would consider this to be mosaic scrap. It also might be suitable for very small suncatchers or jewelry. Size of the pieces can vary from 1/2"" up to about 2 square inches (photo with ruler is the largest sized pieces.)
This glass is not fuseable.
Since most mosaic is applied to un-lit surfaces, there is no clear or see-through glass in this mix. I use stock photos, so the colors you receive will vary from the gallery photo, but I have made an attempt to give each box the widest range of colors available.
To save the buyer money, boxes are shipped Flat Rate. Flat rate is the cheapest method for shipping heavy boxes.  Boxes are generally shipped within 2 days of payment.
NOTE:  GLASS MAY NEED CLEANING ON ARRIVAL. SALVAGED GLASS MAY HAVE DUST, DEBRIS, SHARPIE MARKS OR OLD GLAZING. PIECES GENERALLY CLEAN UP EASILY WITH WATER OR WINDEX. 
 I AM VERY SORRY BUT IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO CLEAN EVERY SINGLE SHARD PRIOR TO SHIPPING.        ",28.95,4.9615,"Craft type: Mosaic making, Stained glass

8mm - slightly larger and fits more people. Possible sites include nostril, helix, daith, tragus, and second lobe.
10mm - good for a piercing farther away from the edge of the ear. Possible sites include lobe, helix, septum.

19954,"Carry On Luggage, Overnight Bag, Cabin Luggage, Carry On Bag, Cabin Bag, Overnight Luggage","
            I put a lot of time making this Carry On Luggage, but it worth it 1000%. I made it for two main purposes: when I go to gym and when I make short trips over the weekend by plane or by car. There's nothing I would add to make it better. It's perfect. It really is. Light, large enough for as many clothes as you need, but it will still fit as a  cabin luggage, very well structured, with a bottom made of thick leather. On the sides, the two pockets will carry your phone, the wallet or the keys, a book, a map, a kindle, your glasses and a small bottle of water.
This bag is also made of waxed canvas, because there's nothing worst then getting at the hotel with your clothes wet. 
The shades it gets over time make the waxed canvas a special fabric. And because of that, the saddle leather is the high class partner it deserves to have.
Both the waxed canvas and the saddle leather evolve and get better over time. Every scratch is recorded and the marks and the shades will remind you of all the journeys you took, to discover the world and to discover yourself. I see these two materials like a photographic film that captures the present for the future.
To preserve the character of the fabrics and to make them last longer, I waterproofed the leather and the lining. Together with the waxed canvas, they make an amazing weekender bag, ready for a long walk on a rainy day.
The height is aprox. 33 cm/ 13'', the deep is aprox. 28 cm/ 11"" and the length is aprox. 55 cm/ 21.5"".
