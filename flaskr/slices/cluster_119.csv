14732,Teal handmade silk cord (1mm) ‚Äì 1 yard/1 metre,"
            This is a hand made silk cord in teal blue, made from premium quality Regency silk thread. It is a little over 1 yard in length (or a little over 1 metre if you prefer metric) and 1mm thick. Lustrous and luxurious, 15 metres of silk thread goes into making 1 metre of this cord. This is not a mass produced cord either. The colours are chosen by me and the thread twisted by me. It is ideal for using in card making, fibre arts, multi media crafts and jewellery making. Use with crimps and jump rings to make simple bracelets or for stringing beads. Can be hand washed if necessary.
Please note: These cords are in 1 metre/1 yard lengths. If you order two or more cords they will be in two (or more) separate lengths, not a continuous length.
Please note: These items are NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS. Although Etsy and Etsy Studio have added them to the Kids' Craft section I do not make my products for kids to craft with. They are artisan materials for other creative adults to work with.

20485,Hot pink fascinator hat  Hot Pink Wedding Hat STAVVY PEON,"
            Each of my pieces is a one-of-a-kind fascinator. You can find something similar at other shops, but never the same , because each fascinator is designed and hand embellished by me. I pick matching colors of petals, flowers, netting and feathers very carefully in order to make my fascinators look really unique.
This hat features beautiful arrangement of pink peon  flowers, supporting feathers, beautiful fuchsia  arrow feathers and tulle . Made of sinamay (mesh) fuchsia  color material and attached to a very comfortable headband covered with satin ribbon.
Very stable and lightweight.
Looks perfect on any hair - short, long, black, blonde...
And it is priced REALLY very fairly ..Compare!
I offer customization of flowers/petals/netting colors FREE OF CHARGE.
Enjoy!
