            Welcome to kiki&gogo! 
This HANDMADE Boy's knit Cardigan Sweater is one of a kind.  It is size 3-4T and is made with a navy and cream/white striped heavy knit and a grass green collar, waist, and cuffs  and is partially up-cycled.  It has green buttons and a darling loop for the top button.  It can be worn with the top button open or closed.  There are orange accent stitches for a little ""extra"" and is a green loop inside the neck for hanging it on a hook.  It will look darling on your little guy!
This cardigan sweater is made using Brindille & Twig's super-cute ""Grandpa Cardigan"" pattern.
Note: my model is actually a size 2-3T so the cardigan will fit a little more snug on your boy size 3-4T.  It will look a little more retro, like Grandpa used to wear!
All of my items are lovingly made by me on my serger and sewing machine in my smoke-free, pet-free home.
I am new to etsy but not new to sewing; I have been sewing quality handmade clothing, housewares, decor, gifts, and baby items for more than 30 years.

            Vintage Crisloid Mah Jong set made in the USA. This set contains 164 tiles (including 8 jokers) and instructions. The set is complete with five racks and coins. The back of the tiles are plain, no pattern. No missing tiles.  No damage to any game pieces. Excellent condition.
The case does show some wear on the outside and corrosion on the latches. It is solid and strong however, the latches and hinges work well. The game set inside is in excellent condition, very little use. This Mah Jongg set belonged to my mother. I can't ever remember my mother actually playing it. It's still packed in the original tissue paper, which has yellowed.
The case appears to be covered in red leather cloth and the tiles appear to be bakelite or a similar plastic,  but I can't be 100% sure. This is truly a beautiful collectors set!
The Crisloid company is well known for making high quality board and tile games in the USA and is still in business today.

1695,ON SALE Antique styled federal loveseat/settee/sofa,"
            New Channel linen upholstery in ivory and black stripe. Goose down-filled cushion is super comfortable and this piece is sturdy and ready for everyday use! Walnut frame has no damage aside from minor surface scratches, no noted blemishes. I believe this piece may be a reproduction, it has all the traditional, classical stylings, but equipped with modern springs and foam. This love seat is casually elegant and will go beautifully with nearly any decor due to its neutral, yet sophisticated tones.
dimensions: 56""L 29""D 32""H
Shipping: 
Shipping charges seen on listing are a rough estimate only and are usually estimated on the higher side of average. Your individual shipping costs may be less, send me a message with your zip code for a more accurate quote. Shipping is out of my control, and delivery dates can not be guaranteed by me, but every attempt to deliver at your convenience will be made. 
The pieces I sell are vintage/preowned, and will show signs of wear and tear, this adds to the character and charm of the pieces. While I do inspect all the pieces I sell for structural/frame damages there may be some that are either not immediately evident, or other smaller blemishes that I miss. I work with antiques all day, so a blemish I may consider to be insignificant might be considered by another to be unsightly or more worrisome. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask for more pictures or information pertaining to the piece(s) you're interested in. 
We do have pricing plans available and can customize any order to nearly any specifications, just send me a message for information or with any requests. 
Thanks!

1756,"Lot de deux dessin de nus sous verre des années 60 - 70, Frenchvintagecharm","
            Lot de deux dessins de femmes nues sous verre.
L'un représente une danseuse de revue, l'autre une jeune fille.
A l'arrière, il y a un carton avec le tampon de l'encadreur et le tout est cerné d'un papier or et noir légèrement déchiré par endroits.
Je n'arrive pas à savoir si ce sont des originaux ou des reproductions, en touts cas elles ont un charme fou et trouveront facilement leur place dans une salle de bain ou une chambre.
Ils mesurent : 21 cm (8,19 inch) de haut par 16 cm (6,24 inch) de large.
Pour certain pays européens, je peux faire partir les objets par transporteur et non par la poste ce qui pourrait s'avérer moins cher, n'hésitez pas à me demander un devis. Pour le reste du monde on peut envisager des envois par la Poste mais sans suivi ce qui serait moins cher aussi, n'hésitez pas à me demander.
Cependant, si vous faites le choix du transporteur, sachez qu’il s’agit de Mondial Relay qui propose des prix attractif mais dont les services sont peu fiables, vous devez donc savoir que je ne ferai aucun remboursement en cas d’avarie ou de perte du colis. Pour la Grande Bretagne, je déconseille franchement ce mode de livraison.

1855,Vintage World Globe WW2 c1945 Regency Styled Illuminated Glass Crams with Bakelite Base,"
            A 12 inch diameter Illuminated Glass Unrivaled Terrestrial Globe by the George F. Cram Co. Indianapolis, IN
A unique and fine representation of the Hollywood Regency style!  Demanding attention not just with it's elegance and style, this commanding piece is a statuesque 25 inches tall.  When illuminated the globe does not just offer a wonderful, warm, golden ambience, but also shares the history of the lost art of globe production.  Meticulous craftsmanship was needed in the production of this illuminated wonder from the hand blown glass orb to the hand applied and perfectly aligned paper map gores to document the world of 1945.
Glass orbs had only been made for a short period, from the mid 1930s to late 1950's.  Eventually replaced by more economical, mass produced plastic models.  Nothing however can be compared to the patina and warm glow of an illuminated glass terrestrial globe. 
Mounted onto a fabulous brown colored Bakelite base, this model is exceptionally rare, offered only for a brief period of time for commercial use and not offered in the official Cram Co. catalog or sold directly to the general public.  The brass plate with the Art Deco detail could be engraved for any occasion or event.  
The map itself is of upmost interesting details, showing the close of World War 2 before borders are finalized.  The Japanese Manchukuo has regained it's original name (Manchuria) and has been returned to China, Thailand once again has become Siam and will remain so until 1949 when it becomes Thailand again.  The map display Baluchistan which will become Palestine in 1947.
This model is in excellent condition with only a minor lighter colored strip in Africa (this is not missing map but appears to be missing shellac).  The Bakelite base is free of any chips or cracks.  The brass plate has some tarnish or loss of the plating.
An unique and beautiful golden orb on a scarce Bakelite mount!

2024,Two Vintage Silhouette Pictures,"
            This is a darling set of two vintage silhouette pictures and frames. Although they are not a matching set, they are of a similar size and would look nice hung together. 
The first is a silhouette of a little girl watering her flowers. This is a very pretty frame, which measures  6 1/2"" by 5 3/4"". The name is ""Garden Pastime"" as is stamped on the back. It says ""A Silhouette of distinction from an old original hand cutting, uniquely transferred in enamels to glass preserving the full sharpness of detail"", and ""Another ""Reliance"" Product"" ""T-1"".
The second is a silhouette of a couple playing music, the boy on a violin, and the girl on a piano. The picture stands out in a lovely oval setting. The frame is a bit plainer than the other one, but still very nice. The original string to hang to picture is missing, but could easily be replaced with a bit of yarn or string. There are a few flakes of the paint that are scattered throughout the frame, but that just adds to the charm.
Thanks for looking!!        ",25.00,4.9333,"Vintage item

3161,Singer Model 99K With Tweed Carrying Case Works!,"
            This is Singer Model 99 Portable Sewing Machine, precursor to the Singer Feather Weight. This is also an all metal machine with a single straight backword/ forward stitch. It has the original foot pedal, silver chrome grille and bobbin winder. The bobbin compartment is accessed from the top of the plate. 
It weighs just under 30 pounds and is quite a bit heavier than the Featherweights but still portable. It does everything a Featherweight can do including leather, denim and heavy fabrics. 
The serial number is EK061176"" and has the ""99K"" and Singer Gold Badge. See fifth photo. 
It also says ""Made in Great Britain"" and ""The Singer Sewing Company"" in bright gold paint.
The machine is 3/4 size and measures 12"" X 9"". The case measures 15"" X 11 1/2"" X 8"" and the machine and the case together weigh 28 pounds. Local pick up is available. 
Condition: This is how I found it. I dusted it off, plugged it in and it runs like a dream-strong and steady. The cord is good, the case has a lot of wear and tear, it needs a new light bulb and to be cleaned and oiled. The instruction manual is available on line.

3164,Vintage Singer 222k Featherweight Sewing Machine - Serviced With New Parts,"
            Singer 222k Compact Free-arm Sewing Machine
 
A very well looked after 222k in excellent condition
 
Chrome and paintwork in good shape with some light signs of use
 
The machine is fully cleaned and serviced and ready to go. One picture shows some sewing done on this machine. It has the characteristic Singer smooth action and is a joy to use!
 
The machine comes with original box (in very good order), various feet, machine oil, foot control, large and small screwdrivers and spare bobbins.
 
It also has a brand new bulb, drive belt and new rubber feet.
 
I am experienced with careful packaging and will use plenty of bubble wrap, packing peanuts and a sturdy box to ensure the machine arrives in perfect condition. The reel holder will also be taken off for transport, this is just held on by one screw so easy to re-attach.
 
Thanks for looking!!!        ",928.63,5.0,"Vintage Supply from the 1950s

3165,Singer Sewing Machine ED188995 // Vintage cast iron working sewing machine // Hand Crank sewing machine with original case //,"
            This is a rather stunning vintage singer sewing machine in its original case. The Serial Number is ED 188995 which dates this machine to 1941. It is a heavy cast Iron black machine with a hand crank mechanism. This means that the machine works by turning the handle at the back. 
The artwork on this machine is still really good and not too worn, the gold paint is still vivid and complete. 
The machine mechanism is really smooth, i did a small service but overall it didnt need it, it is working really smoothly. 
Condition: There are some condition notes with this machine: the cover for the accessories box at the back is enamel and the black enamel is flaked off. This can be seen in the pictures.
there are two areas of woodworm also - one at the front of the base and one on the cover. I have treated the whole machine although it looked like it was not an active patch of woodworm. the damage can be seen as a close up in the photos.
The cover fits on perfectly but does not lock so the machine cannot be lifted using the handle on the lid. 
Overall if you want to use this machine it is in really good nick. these machines were built to last! with minor tweaks to the tension gauge it should sew perfectly. It would also be an incredible display piece. 
If you have any questions or would like any additional photos please get in touch and i would be happy to help.

3172,"Empty Carry Case for Elna Supermatic Sewing Machine- Metal Sewing Machine Case Bed Extender for Elna Supermatics with Foot Pedal, CASE ONLY","
            The Swiss-made Elna sewing machines were wonderful little pieces of engineering, and the case was part of the appeal. The cases can be converted into bed extenders so the sewing machine can be used without being installed into a table. This case is for the later Supermatic models. It has a couple of spots on the walls that can be used to hold accessories, including a foot pedal holder. It has a dark gray crinkle paint exterior and a bright bronze interior.
The case is in great shape. It's clean, aside from some flecks of white paint on the outside. There's a small dent in one of the top corners. It opens and closes exactly as it's intended to, and it latches securely. There are a few small patches of rust on the bottom, which I've treated with a rust sealant.
The serial number on the bottom of the case shows that it was made for a 1964 Star Series Elna Supermatic, so it will probably fit best for a machine with a serial number ending in B, but as far as I can tell it should work just fine for any machine with a serial number ending in any of the letters B-L (Production dates 1964-71). It's intended for a machine with a foot pedal, so I can't promise that a free arm sewing machine would fit correctly. Please check your machine against the measurements for this case.

            This is Singer Model 99K Portable Sewing Machine is similar to the Singer Featherweight, but is a bit heavier at 30 poounds.  It's an all metal machine with a single straight backward and forward stitch. It has the original foot pedal, silver chrome grille and bobbin winder. The bobbin compartment is accessed from the top of the plate.
This machine will do everything a Featherweight can do including leather, denim and heavy fabrics.
The serial number is EM512616 and has the ""99K"" and Singer Gold Badge.  This machine was manufactured in Canada.  Paint is in very nice condition and it is nice and shiny which is why there is so much glare in the pics.
The machine is 3/4 size and measures 12"" X 9"". The case measures 15"" X 11 1/2"" X 8"" and the machine and the case together weigh 28 pounds. Local pick up is available.
I have dusted this machine off, plugged it in and it runs like a dream-strong and steady. The cord is good, the case has a lot of wear and tear.  The lamp is working properly and I'm sure the machine needs to be cleaned and oiled.  I understand the instruction manual is available on line. 
I do not sew, so if you have any specific questions, I will give it my best shot at answering for you.  Of course, I'm happy to provide more pics if you need them.        ",150.00,4.9818,"Vintage item from the 1940s

3178,Antique Betsy Ross Child's Sewing Machine In Working Condition With Case,"
            This delightful child's Betsy Ross sewing machine, model 707, was made in the 1940s and early 50s by Gibraltar Manufacturing Co.  It's a heavy little machine, weighing over 6 pounds, with all metal parts, except for the belt.  It comes with a red alligator-like case that has a red plastic handle on top and brass latches on each end.  In its case, it measures 8"" x 8"" x 6-1/2"".
I plugged this sewing machine in and pressed the on switch and it appears to work perfectly.  It has been lovingly cared for through the years.  The paint is in near perfect condition, without scratches, and there's no rust on any of the parts. The only flaws I could find were some fleabite chips of paint loss on the wheel and some minor dings on the case.        ",158.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1940s

            Singer Featherweight, The Classic Portable, Sewing Machine, Quilters Machine, Featherweight 221, Japan Black Finish, Vintage 1952 Singer.
Singer Featherweight 221, the perfect portable. Perfect for taking to quilting classes, perfect for piecing quilts. Such a space saver. I had mine and used it in my tiny apartment in downtown San Francisco. My aunt takes her featherweight with her while traveling in her RV. I knew a teacher who ran a side business making pillows in her tiny apartment, all the sewing was done on her featherweight. The serial number on this wonderful machine indicates a manufacture date of August 11, 1952. This one was made in the Elizabethport, NJ.
This machine is ready to sew!  I had it professionally cleaned, lubed, oiled and adjusted and the belt replaced.   The gold decals are in beautiful shape with no thinning anywhere.  The machine also comes with all the accessories shown in the first picture. It has it's original instruction booklet!  So hard to find these days. The accessories box is in good shape and is original. The foot pedal is original.   It even has the original Singer oil can.  It's a bit banged up but it's the first one I've ever seen.  There's no oil in it and I wouldn't recommend filling it but it's a cool accessory and has it's own metal clip in the case.
The carrying case is original and in very good shape for the 60 years it's been around.  The snap closures work and the hinges and handle are in good working order.  The box itself smells clean and dry.  It looks as though a couple of the top corners were repaired or re-covered a long time ago but the repair works well.

            Hi and Welcome to my Place :-)
This is for a group of 5 Vintage Sewing Bobbins.

Interested buyers, e-mail for ship cost.
***********************************************************
General Note:
Aside from a lot of sewing, I do a lot of assorted crafting (making gift baskets, decoupaging gourds to make into birdhouses, recovering lampshades, dream catchers, etc.). I've acquired Boxes *many vintage fabrics and materials* at estate auctions up here in Wisconsin. 
If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to send me an e-mail :-)
I ship Immediately.

I actually owned this machine years ago! I gave it away but found the manuals the other day!! Oops!
It was solid metal in its own sewing table. Very heavy!! Probably still working.
I gave it up once I got my mothers older machine. Those little Kenmores sure run strong!
The manuals are in great condition no tears, rips or missing pages.
Great for the retro manual collector!

3199,222 Singer Featherweight Sewing Machine Freearm 222K EL68,"
            Please Note:  The textile art in the photographs is not for sale.  This listing is for the Singer 222K  Free Arm Featherweight I used to create the piece.  The machine sews perfect 1/4"" seams evenly with steady, precise strokes..  
This 222K is part of our Featherweight PSTA team.  
https://www.etsy.com/people/trumpetvine?ref=owner_profile_leftnav
 
Featherweight 222K Freearm:
110v. motor 
Condition: 9
Here’s a machine which almost made the ultimate 9 out of 10 on the Black Singer Featherweight condition chart. 
This fabulous freearm's  decals show little trace of wear or fading – and perfect chrome.   The paintwork has that deep gorgeous black Featherweight shine. 
The only reason we could not give this machine the ultimate accolade is that the machine has a few small scratches on the extension bed.  So here’s a near-perfect machine that would be at home on a collector’s shelf or in the hands of a discriminating seamstress.
Please remember that all our 222K Freearm machines come with 110 volt motors for North American electrical outlets. (unless otherwise requested)   The machine comes with a full range of attachments/feet  and 3 original Singer bobbins.
Fully cleaned inside and out, serviced and sew tested before leaving the workshop.  Both bobbin tension and upper thread tension have been adjusted to deliver a beautiful stitch.  Any bright marks are from the flash.  All flaws are always described.
This machine. as with all other Featherweights we sell, comes with three vital documents:. 
1)  A certificate giving a statement of Singer's original badge-issue date. 
2)  A guarantee that the machine contains no reproduction parts.
3)  An original Singer 222 manual.
Singer's records show that this machine, serial number prefix EL68,  was produced on September 17, 1956.

About ""Touch of Pink"": the textile art piece:  Comprised of 1008 pieces, each 15/16"" square.  This the second art piece I have completed with this 222K.     This particular machine sews precisely straight 1/4 "" seams, rolling over cross-seams absolutely effortlessly, and never racing on ahead.  Even, steady, straight, flawless.

3201,Vintage British Sewing Machines Ltd (BSM) Model 7000 Hand Crank Sewing Machine With Wooden Case,"
            Vintage British Sewing Machines Ltd Model 7000, made in the 1930's by Vickers 
This model is smaller than some of the other hand-cranked machines of the era, and some may argue that they have a more attractive look too
This machine is in mechanically working condition and the crank has a smooth, well cared-for motion. The wooden base and bentwood case both show signs of wear and tear that would be expected from an actively used machine. NOTE: The case has a hole in the top which isn't clear in the photos.
Interestingly this model was one of the last produced by Vickers, who by the 1930's had turned their attention to the War Effort, and were a large manufacturer of weapons, ships and aircraft.
This item is an eye catcher and could either be used by someone interested in sewing, or to add a focal piece to a room or venue

3523,"Pink baby jacket, baby coat, embroidered baby clothes, handmade baby jacket, wool felt, linen, teddy clothes, doll clothes, vintage baby","
            The sweetest vintage pink embroidered baby jacket. All hand stitched from wool felt and fully lined in white linen and the then embroidered with satin cotton threads to make beautiful flowers at the neckline and hem. All the edges are blanket stitched and this charming piece is finished with blush pink ribbons to tie it closed at the neck and in the middle. it doesn't look as if this piece has ever been worn which is such a shame as it is beautiful. It would make a charming doll/teddy jacket. Age wise I would date this piece to the 1960's it could be even earlier than that.
If I had to size this piece I would estimate it to be for a 0-3 month baby.
From the collar to the hem it is: 7 inches or 18 cm. There aren't shoulder/ arm seams it is one piece of wool felt so this is not a precise measurement, I estimate it to be: 11 inches or 28 cm these were taken when flat. 
From cuff to cuff straight across the chest it is: 19 inches or 48 cm. 
Teddy is just a model he is not included in the sale.        ",33.17,4.9762,"Vintage item from the 1960s

3651,Antique ballet costume enssemble,"
            Antique ballet costume from the 40's made from red velvet and metallic thread, 
This ensemble is an interesting mixture between traditional folkloric dress and a renaissance style, there are a few embroidered appliqués around the collar, the skirt used to be worn with a crinoline therefore needs to be adjusted to your waist. Keep in mind these clothes were made for the stage and therefore do not have proper finishings! 
A second top can be purchased and layered for an additional 25 euros or can be sold separately!
The back is closed with hooks

4211,Cartier Burgandy Vintage Collectible Cartier Burgundy Purse Hand Bag Made In Paris France,"
            This Cartier is in overall very good condition for its age of about 35 years. It has seam issues at the bottom of the flap (looks like it has been glued)? Also, a tear on the right side (as shown in the pics) and some discoloration from the sun when you open up the flap. Underneath the flap is darker than the purse that has been exposed to light. The last 24 years it has been stored away. There is no musty smell to it at all. 
POCKETS: There is one open pocket on the back of the purse that spans the entire length. On the inside of the purse is a main open area the entire length of the purse, followed by a zippered pocket (in the middle) that spans the entire length of the purse, followed by another “main” part, followed by a 6 inch zippered pocket. The purse measures 9.25 inches in length, 6.5 inches in height and is about 3 inches wide (depth) at the bottom of the purse. The drop is about 8 inches. The closure snaps into place. On the inside of the flap (right side) it reads “Made In France For Cartier.” On the right side it reads “Cartier  Paris.” NOTE: This is not a new purse! There are obvious issues. It is also a VERY RARE purse. An extremely small amount of this style was produced. I couldn’t imagine that ANYONE would use this purse. It would be considered a collector’s dream. Any questions prior to purchase please don’t hesitate to ask. Also, if you would like any additional pics I would be glad to send them. 
Thanks for looking!        ",79.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1980s

SHIPPING NOTES
*Vintage and retro items as we know have been preowned/preloved. I do my best to describe accurately and honestly the condition of every item with pictures of flaws or issues if there are any. But there will probably be a bit of wear on most items. I always recommend that you hand wash anything vintage as the harsh dishwasher chemicals can erode shine, lustre and patterns. I apply a food grade beeswax to all my kitchen wood products, to help protect the finish and keep the wood from drying out.
Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions regarding anything.*
 
Shipping cost is an ESTIMATE, please contact me PRIOR TO PURCHASE with your postal code for a more accurate and precise price and will adjust the shipping price so that the total is accurate at time of checkout. 
I do ship to the USA, however due to the cost of shipping from Canada it is best that we discuss the cost PRIOR TO PURCHASE. I can give you an exact price upon request.
Shipping is done by weight and box size, it may be less then listed or slightly more depending on what you are purchasing, but I would be happy to give you the most accurate and economical price.
If you are purchasing more than one item shipping can be combined.
 
Delivery available for customers in Toronto at a minimal charge (10), please contact prior to purchase for details.        ",42.41,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1970s

5200,Vintage Patchwork Feed Sack Print circa 1950,"
            This listing is for a pastel patchwork quilt printed feed sack c. 1950.  The colors are bright and cheerful. The bag has been opened, washed and pressed.  I don't find any holes or stains.   It is large; it measures 52 x 36. The bagging fabric was nearly always 36 inches selvage to selvage. It is better quality than most feed sack fabrics and I was starting to doubt that it was a feed sack until I located the holes where it was stitched.  They are hard to find in this one.
Please see my other listings. I have a number of feed sacks listed. My mother collected them to use in quilting and also collected advertising feed sacks. When I was a child we lived near one of my sets of grandparents. Grandpa was a railroad engineer but he also raised turkeys and chickens. My mom made many items from feedbags--dishtowels, our clothes, her own ""house dresses"" and used them in quilts, doll clothes and other crafts. The ragged ones became dad's towels in the garage or our cleaning cloths and dust rags. My mom frequently asked my grandpa to try to get 3 bags of the same design so she would have enough to make herself a dress or make kitchen curtains.
note: if you buy more than one item I will refund any postage overage.        ",23.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1950s

5370,Jürgen Reipka 'Op Art' Serigraph -- signed and numbered,"
            Jürgen Reipka's (German, 1936-2013) distinctive work is widely collected. This 1960-70s signed and numbered colored silkscreen-like Op-Art composition of his unique style and use of bright colors gives the piece an optical effect of motion. The estimated value of similar works by Reipka ranges from the mid-300s to over 500 in today's market.
The artwork is pencil signed in the lower right ‘Reipka’ and numbered in the lower left (81/100). There are a few small paint losses extending through the image but nothing that detracts from the overall visual and artistic impact of the unframed piece, which you can see in the photos. The outer margins of the sheet have with some wear and there is some paper discoloration around the image (probably from sunlight). The price reflects these issues, however. 
The sheet measures 23.5 x 16.5 inches. and the image is 15 x 14.5 inches. The sheet is embossed at the lower left FR and there is, what looks like a catalogue/inventory number (1--43-81) and a dollar amount of 18 in the center bottom; a bargain originally!
Reipka attended Art School Bremen (1960-63) and from 1963-68 at Art Academy of Fine Arts in Munich (1973) and its president from 1976-79. He was also a Member of the German Association of Artists and the New Group in Munich.        ",245.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1980s

5375,Original Acrylic Painting Rabbits,"
            This is the most precious original Acrylic painting of three little bunnies in nature. It is signed A. Benda. I have not been able to find any information on the artist. That said, the artist is obviously accomplished as the painting comes alive and draws you into a sweet story. The painting was done on a flat canvas, not stretched on a frame. The canvas is 13 x 11 and the painted portion is 8.75 x 10.75. It is in very good condition. 
I acquired this painting from an auction house in Northern Virginia. However, it originated from Oakridge Auction Gallery in Vienna, VA, as there is an inventory label on the back of the canvas from the gallery.  This gallery offers distinctive, unique, and beautiful items to selective museums and discerning collectors globally. 
This painting would be so perfect framed in a nursery or young childs room.

5581,Vintage Hair Barrette - Faux Tortoiseshell Hair Clasp - Rhinestones - Diamantes - 1960s Hair Clasp - Vintage Hair Slide - Hair Ornament,"
            This is a very pretty little hair barrette from the 1960s, or possibly a bit older.
It is made of moulded plastic made to look like tortoiseshell, and is studded with little rhinestones.
It is in good condition, with all rhinestones present and still sparkly (in some of the photos it may look like there are stones missing near the centre but it's the roots of the little spikes on the rear side showing through).
It measures approx. 2 1/2"" in length; the metal fixture at the back has lost some of its gold tone but it is in good working order.
Please note that I do not charge additional postage if you purchase more than one item.

            Nice Eddie Bauer Wool Men's Hat. This hat has a wool band around it. It is 100% wool. It measures 23 1/2"" in circumference, the brim is 2"", 5"" from the brim to the top, 11 1/2"" brim to brim. There is no tag inside the hat as to the size. The hat is in very good vintage condition. I do not detect any holes or tears. This is a nice hat. Great for the winter!

Here at Big Wave Clothing Co I am inspired by the ""Aloha"" spirit and want to bring fun and creative designs to the masses. Custom one of a kind designs created by me (Jeff) here in Las Vegas the (9th Island). lol. I aim to please your heart and soul with my designs. I really enjoy the Sand-n-Surf side of life, so you will see that the Hawaiian inspired culture of surfing,beach,ocean and floral designs will reflect in many of the shirts and bedding and bath items I have created.
With every sale I receive I will be donating 1.00 towards the Saving the Green Sea turtle Organization. So come on, wear a cool shirt and help save the Green Sea turtle and the same time. Mahalo!

The printing process is call Dye Sublimation. its a cool technology that takes a solid and turns it into a gas with high heat than adheres to the fabric leaving the product with a very soft feel with no cracking or fading. just machine wash with cold water and normal dry.

Size: 12x24
This set is made entirely of cabinetry scraps.  I have finally gotten around to using the chunky pieces of maple, alder, and poplar wood scraps that I salvaged from my little brother's cabinetry shop many moons ago.  I used warm colors with a transparent paint technique.... 
I love the simplicity of this set, and intend to create many more pieces in this series - keep a look out.  
Your made to order piece will be very similar to the example shown. No two pieces are exactly alike...each is beautiful and unique in its own right. For my lead time on completing this piece or to discuss your ideas for customizing it, just click the ""contact the shop owner"" hyperlink below and I'll get back with you soon
This piece is so earthy, yet bold and modern, and would add such a special touch to any space.  
Please contact me for a shipping quote for international orders, as well as shipping to Alaska and Hawaii.

            Are you tired of putting your hard earned money into playmats that wear out and split after just a few months of use? Looking for a mat that's as unique as you are?
Thick oily tan leather top and chrome tan brown bottom. One of a kind.
All our playmats are made by hand from unique real leather hides and measures 13.78x23.63 inches (60x35 centimeters). These hides are made in limited numbers and when these mats are gone, they're gone forever.
If you are looking for specific colors, let us know and we will see what we have in stock.

Our leather is made to last a lifetime. It's 100% hide, no vinyl, no pleather, nothing fake. There is nothing to compare to the look and feel real leather goods.
There may be scratches, scars, or blemishes in the leather. This is nothing which will affect durability. It is merely a characteristic inherent in all leathers.

10004,Cribbage board | walnut Cribbage board | personalized Cribbage board,"
            Cribbage is a fun card game in which players keep score by moving pegs around a track on the board. This full size 121-hole board has tracks for two players, and the hinged lid opens to allow storage for pegs and a standard deck of cards. 
The board is made from solid local Missouri walnut. It comes with six metal pegs for scoring (three silver, three gold, giving you a spare of each); cards not included.

10428,"DIY ""Platinum"" ST Style Electric Guitar Kit","
            Solid body six string electric guitar kit with beautiful alder body, maple neck, and upgraded locking tuners, bridge and pickups. This is a fantastic quality, easy to build, dual single-coil electric guitar kit.
These kits go together easily, all the parts work together well, and the instrument can be assembled without a lot of experience with woodworking or instrument building.
Every hole is drilled for each component, including neck, bridge, pickguard and strap button mounting holes. No soldering is required; all electronics connect together with easy to attach connectors. We have done most of the hard work for you! The body needs finish sanding only but should require no filling.
The guitar kit comes with chrome hardware, an upgraded tremolo bridge, a white 3-ply pickguard, three single coil pickups, and all necessary hardware. A set of Fender strings is even included.
This is not a cheap Chinese manufactured kit of questionable quality where the parts simply don’t work together (like most of the other kits that you will find on Ebay, Etsy and Amazon). We proudly manufacture these kits in our shop in Portland, Oregon. We are a family-owned company building products and traditions that we expect to last for a long, long time.

            SHIPPING COSTS VARIES DEPENDING ON YOUR LOCATION.
CONTACT US WITH YOUR ADDRESS FOR SHIPPING COSTS.
Jose G. Ahumada, owner at Exceptional Craft, has 20 years of experience working in recording/production/live sound/recording studios. 
At  1250.00 dollars, this table is built  out of the highest quality materials to ensure no sagging. 
There is not a single piece made out of compressed wood or MDF. Our tables are 100% solid wood and birch plywood, we have added torsion bars on the piano tray and desktop bottom to ensure no warping down due to gear weight.
The top of this desktop is also strengthened with a 4"" depth frame of maple at the front. Maple is a very high quality, hardwood. This addition ensures there will be no warping and sagging throughout the years.
The piano tray is built out of strong birch plywood and has even more added stability due to a iron torsion bar placed at the back of the tray. This is another addition to ensure the piano tray will not sag over many years of use.
The finishes are the highest quality stains and lacquers, applied in multiple layers. 
One of the coolest features about our desks and racks: the Racks are not attached to the desk, they easily slide on the top surface of the desk making it really comfortable to have access to your  gear (moving the racks back and forward) specially in those times when you are tracking a voice and you need quick access to the pre-amp, the guitar POD, Compressor, interface Preamp, etc. also the amount of space left on top of the desk is significantly more than other desks on the market. 
Our goal for each customer is that you never have to worry about your desk again. We have created a product that is a pleasure to use and will look absolutely terrific. 
1250.00 is the price for a desk as seen in the picture. It includes a roll out piano tray and two 4 space racks. 
Customization is available, any color and size  (there might be price adjustment) (some customization might reduce/increase price) send us a message with your  questions.
The Standard piano tray (as shown) is 6 7/8"" height by 57 1/2"" width. This Piano tray (as shown) fits an 88-weighted keys keyboard, like a motif XS8/XF8.
Desk-top is 65-in wide by 30-in depth. (we can a fit any size keyboard to this piano tray in case you have something like a Rhodes MK80 or kORG 01W PRO FD or any other keyboard! )
The two 4 space rack units included have a depth of 15"" giving you plenty of room to place your studio monitors.
Thanks.

10950,Pop-up Phone Grip in iPhone colours | selfie handgrip stand | Free car mount,"
            Keep a grip on your Phone with the Pop-Up Phone Grip.
The Pop-Up Phone grip is an innovative Phone accessory which uses an expanding rubber concertina construction to provide a mobile phone grip with three use positions;
 (1)   The flat position allows you to use your phone unhindered by the phone grip as it lies flat against the back of your phone (only a few millimeters thick). 
 (2)   The middle position allows a good grip on your phone while you are calling and a stand with a low viewing angle for watching video.
 (3)   The fully out position gives you a firm grip on the phone for action selfies and video shooting. The fully out position also gives you a stand with a steeper viewing angle.
The phone grip is also an easy and convenient way to store your ear buds, simply leave the buds plugged in and wrap the cord around the Pop-Up grip, pop the grip down and you capture the cable so it can't come loose. You can add one or two grips to your phone depending on your need. Offered in 5 colours, Silver, Rose Gold, White, Black and Space Grey, perfectly matching the iPhone colours.
The Pop-Up Grip can be very useful for larger phones and Tablets which because of their size are not easy to grip (especially with one handed holding and the other on the touch screen
the Pop-Up Phone grip comes with a free car mount making handsfree calling and navigation easy. The car mount can also be used in the house to hold you phone by your charging position, or next to your bed as an easy alarm clock.        ",6.65,5.0,"Handmade item

            Un beau cadeau pour homme, femme, mamie, papie, enfants, amis et même votre chef. Et pourquoi pas pour vous-même?
Réalisé à la main dans du chêne français issu du développement durable, c'est un objet qui n'a pas de fin de vie. Il est chaleureux, il se marie bien avec le métallique des gadgets, on peut y mettre aussi bien son smartphone que sa tablette (et si on n'a plus on peut l'utiliser comme bougeoir ou support pour un petit pot de fleurs!).
Avant de vous donner les dimensions, regardez un peu la forme. Les angles, la rainure et les trou pour laisser le doigt appuyer sur le buton central. Tout est étudié pour faire un objet unique. Vous pouvez également coucher le téléphone, le support sera tout aussi agréable.
La forme unique lui permet de recevoir même une tablette mini, la surface de la base étant la plus grande possible pour une meilleure stabilité, sans augmenter le poids.
Réalisé sur commande spécialement pour votre téléphone. Avec ou sans protection, avec ou sans coque. A vous de me donner, lors de votre commande, l'épaisseur de votre smartphone (avec ou sans la protection, en fonction de comment vous l'utiliserez sur cet support).
Vient ensemble avec un petit sac en coton (non-traité, Westford Mill ou autre marque équivalente), pour une présentation originale de cadeau. Le téléphone et l'éléphant en bois qui sont présents dans les photos ne sont pas inclus dans le prix.
Eléphant: 
https://www.etsy.com/fr/listing/461294360/decoration-murale-chambre-enfant-jouet
Dimensions approximative base 92 x 73 mm. Epaisseur bois 28 mm.
Poids approx. 150g.
Je livre en France et partout dans le monde, par La Poste. 
Livraison gratuite à Strasbourg, me contacter avant de commander.
Attention: ne laissez pas l'objet dans les mains des petits enfants ou bébés.
Note importante: 
Le bois est un matériau dont les veines ne sont jamais identiques. Donc, le produit que vous allez recevoir peut ne pas être identique aux photos. Le matériau reste le même, les dimensions aussi.
Etant donné que tous mes objets sont réalisés à la main (avec un minimum d'utilisation des machines électriques), ils pourraient avoir des petits défauts de fabrication (petits éclatements dans les coins, rainure non-parfaite, ponçage non-uniforme etc). Ceux-ci ne changent pas l'esthétique de l'objet. Au contraire même, ces petits défauts éventuels lui donnent une âme et rappellent que c'est un humain qui l'a réalisé. Si vous êtes à la recherche d'un objet ""IKEA"", parfaitement coupé avec une machine numérique sans aucune intervention humaine, vous n'êtes pas sur le bon site.

The ring consists of many layers that create a cute puff to the ring, creating a shape of a daisy flower in a full bloom.
This ring is created using a special material that you wouldn't believe its qualities! You can drop it in the purse, squeeze it, get under water with it and will have no effect on the flower you are wearing. Isn't that something?
This resistant material will ensure a long lasting quality and looks of your new jewelry. 
Ring color - Antique bronze. Ring size - adjustable.
Base ring size - US 6 1/4, ring size can be adjusted to be slightly bigger.
Flower size is about 1.75  inches (45 mm) in diameter. 
You receive your jewelry in a nice box.
Notice - a gift box design might vary.
Remember that each flower is made by hand without using any special pattern tool! So each flower is completely unique and can slightly differ from one on a photo. But nevertheless each detail is made with care and love, so your earrings will be as great as they possibly can be.
If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me! 
Due to differences in screens and set ups colors might slightly vary.

The vintage-inspired, housed within a modern design, takes you to another time and place not quite sure when or where. I am sure you have seen a huge variety of engagement rings and many of them probably look the same.  My motto is ""forever"".   I want you to be even happier with your unique piece of jewelry ten or twenty years after you buy it.  I garner inspiration from all around me, knowing that my work will be a piece of jewelry for life, something which will never be taken off and will be passed on for generations. 
Due to the many unethical methods and dangers of mining gold in this day and age as well as its scarcity, I believe in using only high quality recycled materials and conflict free stones in my store. Not only is it less harmful and wasteful, it is practical and inspiring.

11670,Let's dance: illustrated book of poems about dancing,"
            This is a book for dance-lovers. It’s a book for everyone who catches their breath at the ballet or in front of Strictly Come Dancing, or who can’t look away when someone magnificent takes to the floor in a club. 
Beautifully produced on fine cream paper and with sunflower yellow endpapers, this is a gorgeous collection of new poems by modern poets, assembled by Emma Wright (me!) and Rachel Piercey as a celebration of the joy and magic of dance. There are poems about everything from sloppy kitchen shuffles, strict ballet teachers and underwater waltzes.
The poems are accompanied by 8 line-drawings I've drawn of Northern soul dancers, because I feel I really learned to dance just for myself, without self-consciousness, when I found out about Northern soul a few years ago.

This flower is created using a special material that you wouldn't believe its qualities! You can drop it in the purse, squeeze it, get under water with it and will have no effect on the flower you are wearing. Isn't that something?
This resistant material will ensure a long lasting quality and looks of your new jewelry. 
Flower is securely attached to a silver colored brooch/alligator hair clip, just choose where to wear this flower today.
Flower size is about 5 inches (12 cm) in diameter. 
Remember that each flower is made by hand without using any special pattern tool! So each flower is completely unique and can slightly differ from one on a photo. But nevertheless each detail is made with care and love, so your earrings will be as great as they possibly can be.
If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me! 
Due to differences in screens and set ups colors might slightly vary.

            blue star necklace terrarium gifts for mom blue weddings flower pendants for her minimalist jewelry resin flower girl gift silver spoon Р86
This is a little charming pendant necklace with natural floral components.
All flowers are carefully selected and dried by hand without use of any chemicals. 
Those are nice blue flowers.
Bright blue natural components preserved in a spoon pendant that is about 2.25 inches long(~6 cm).
Or choose a color you like more.
Flowers preserved in high-quality french jewelry resin. This resin is resistant to environmental conditions and safe to skin. Also even though it meant to imitate glass it is much lighter in weight.
The chain is silver colored with a comfortable crab claw clasp. 
The length is 18 inches (46 cm). If you would like another length please let me know in a convo or a message to the seller.
This will be great to wear both with open chest clothes and neck high ones. Vibrant colors will always be in contrast and stand out even with your natural skin color.
Your jewelry will arrive in a neat rustic looking bag.
Packing will be perfect for gifting this jewelry or storing it in the future.
Each jewelry piece is created by hand with unique floral components, so there are no two identical works.
Modern jewelry with both rustic and romantic twist.

12707,Lavender Wands,"
            Beautiful Lavender Wands hand made by my husband Jim. He makes the wands when the stems are green.. You can only make wands when the lavender is still green so this is a once a year gift.
You can occasionally roll the woven end gently between your hands to refresh the release of the wonderful scent of the flowers inside. The wand itself will last for many years, the scent can be refreshed with a few drops of essential oils. I have even seen a photo of a 40 year old wand with the caption that it still held the aroma of lavender.
Each wand is 6"" to 8"" in length. The largest in each size group is sent first, each one is different. It is very unusual for this size to be less that 8"" until the end of the season.
A beautiful addition to any of your gift baskets. Wonderful wedding and party favors.
.
Place in a sunny window, on your desk, your tote, closet, sneak one into a gift bag, even put one on the dashboard of your vehicle to fill your space with this wonderful scent.        ",10.00,4.9091,"Handmade item

Peel the wine label from its back sheet.
Line the edge of the wine label alongside the seam of the bottle.
Slowly rub your finger back and forth along the wine label as you affix it to the bottle.
*If you make a mistake and it’s crooked - it’s okay! You can slowly peel the label off and try again!

THE CANON A-1:
Top model of the A-series Canons - the most advanced and modern SLR in the ""A"" series 
Has “Program” mode, aperture-priority, shutter priority to freeze or blur motion , and full manual. This combination of shooting modes set the A-1 apart from the other A-series cameras.
Single finger control through a tiny selector wheel on the front of the top plate for shooting in aperture-priority to shutter-priority to Program mode, adjusting the settings in each of these modes, and taking a photo.
A retractable cover protects the selector wheel from accidental movement, and a viewfinder shutter prevents accidental light from spilling onto the film when shooting when not using the viewfinder.
An exceptional selection of slow shutter speeds (2,4,8,15, and 30 sec.) 
Choose your shooting mode, and just shoot. This camera creates exacting exposures in every mode, with every shot. The exposure compensation is there to help things along manually, but most say they've never needed it. 
When shooting in manual mode the camera viewfinder shows the shutter speed and the aperture that it thinks should be used.
Build quality of the A-1 is really good, certainly better than any other A-series camera. The A-1 is stronger, faster, better, than any other A-series machine, and you can feel that fact when you hold and shoot it.
A-1s come with the standard 50mm ƒ/1.8, an extremely capable lens.
This camera is perfect for anyone, from the new student to the highly-advanced photographer. It can do everything any shooter will ask of it.        ",165.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1980s

Note - listing is for 2 shoe/purse clips.
Let us present you a sweet medium sized flower shoe/purse clip in an ivory color. Those colors would be perfect for weddings, summer and romantic occasions as a cute decoration for your lovely pair for shoes or a purse.
The flower consists of many layers that create a cute puff, creating a shape of a daisy flower in a full bloom.   
This flower is created using a special material that you wouldn't believe its qualities! You can drop it in the purse, squeeze it, get under water with it and will have no effect on the flower you are wearing. Isn't that something?
This resistant material will ensure a long lasting quality and looks of your new jewelry. 
Flower is securely attached to a silver colored clip.
Flower size is about 1.75  inches (45 mm) in diameter. 
Remember that each flower is made by hand without using any special pattern tool! So each flower is completely unique and can slightly differ from one on a photo. But nevertheless each detail is made with care and love, so your earrings will be as great as they possibly can be.
If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me! 
Due to differences in screens and set ups colors might slightly vary.

Let us present you a sweet medium sized ring in a nice mint-green color. Those colors would be perfect for everyday summer wear as a cute decoration for your lovely fingers.
The ring consists of many layers that create a cute puff to the ring, creating a shape of a daisy flower in a full bloom.
This ring is created using a special material that you wouldn't believe its qualities! You can drop it in the purse, squeeze it, get under water with it and will have no effect on the flower you are wearing. Isn't that something?
This resistant material will ensure a long lasting quality and looks of your new jewelry. 
Ring color - Antique bronze. Ring size - adjustable.
Base ring size - US 6 1/4, ring size can be adjusted to be slightly bigger.
Flower size is about 1.75  inches (45 mm) in diameter. 
You receive your jewelry in a nice box.
Notice - a gift box design might vary.
Remember that each flower is made by hand without using any special pattern tool! So each flower is completely unique and can slightly differ from one on a photo. But nevertheless each detail is made with care and love, so your earrings will be as great as they possibly can be.
If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me!

            Medium DOORKNOCKER EARRINGS 18K Gold and Oxidized Sterling Silver Signed JM 16 grams
These smaller size are just as magnificent earrings as the larger ones and signed JM for what once was Jammis Inc. by the designer and maker Jerry Madison. They were for pierced ears, but the pierced stems were removed to be just clip-ons, an easy fix back to being for pierced ears. These measure 1-5/8""H x 1-1/4""W at the widest point. They are extremely light weight.  
I just had to polish one earring to show the beauty of these earrings, as you can see they were extremely tarnished. They move with your movements. Notice that even with polishing the oxidized silver portions have a fabulous patina. They are signed STERLING JM 18K on both. They weigh 0.5 ounces or 16 grams. Please let me know if you want the other polished.

17811,Alexander the Great - A necklace of the Macedonian king. Ancient Greece,"
            Alexander the Great necklace
Diameter of amulet - 3.8 cm / 1-1/2 inches
 
This handsome necklace features one of the greatest and most famous figures of the ancient world. From the Mediterranean cities and provinces, to Egypt and India, Alexander the Great had an explorative mind that wished to see the depth and breadth of the unknown world.  
Vast distances were travelled with a loyal entourage, an army of soldiers and thousands of horses. Alexander brought many established civilisations under the influence of Macedonian culture, opening trade routes and maintaining others. From the Nile to the Oxus river, outposts were established in the name of Alexander but native customs were allowed to continue.
In Egypt he took on the role of Pharaoh and ushered in a new renaissance of Egyptian culture that would be eventually known as the Ptolemaic dynasty. 
Made of a composition stone using quartzite and limestone, this replica amuletic necklace has an aged earthy patina. It has been given a light polish which adds great contrasting highlights in the decorative patterns of this highly detailed piece. A 48 cm / 19-1/4 inch length of plaited leather with silver clasps completes the style.
* Included with this necklace is a small collector card featuring  an outstanding relief carving of Alexander his horse and a wild boar.        ",27.16,5.0,"Handmade item

            purple hair accessory for bride purple hair jewelry for women gifts purple flower jewelry for hair purple gifts for girlfriend birthday D4
Let us present you a sweet medium sized flower hair jewelry in a bright color. Those colors would be perfect for summer occasions as a cute decoration for your lovely hair style.
The flower consists of many layers that create a cute puff, creating a shape of a daisy flower in a full bloom. The flower is decorated with few curling strings.  
This flower is created using a special material that you wouldn't believe its qualities! You can drop it in the purse, squeeze it, get under water with it and will have no effect on the flower you are wearing. Isn't that something?
This resistant material will ensure a long lasting quality and looks of your new jewelry. 
Flower is securely attached to a gold colored hair stick.
Hair stick length is about 5 inches (13 cm) including the flower.
Flower size is about 1.75  inches (45 mm) in diameter. 
Remember that each flower is made by hand without using any special pattern tool! So each flower is completely unique and can slightly differ from one on a photo. But nevertheless each detail is made with care and love, so your earrings will be as great as they possibly can be.
If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me! 
Due to differences in screens and set ups colors might slightly vary.

In the collection there will always be two colourways per style: one black, and one ‘alternative’ colour. Your shoes will always be Limited Edition. 
The dustbag and the info label are made using wastage materials from Scrap, Centre of Creative Reuse, Play and Learning: A social enterprise based in Leeds, focused on helping the environment by reusing waste materials from businesses as resources for art and play.

If you'd like a customization, please leave me a note with the customization in the ""additional notes"" box at check out. 
Due to the fact that these are handpainted, and made to order, please allow 2-3 weeks before they ship. However, they usually do not take that long for me to finish.
Shoes are sealed, and can be gotten wet. Wipe dirt and water off lightly with a wash cloth. I would not machine wash, just to keep the shoe preserved.        ",20.00,5.0,"Handmade item

CRAFTMANSHIP
We dedicated true craftsmanship on making this toiletry bag, from dying, cutting, stitching to edge polishing. It’s a made to order piece, not mass produced! A precious gift for boyfriend, husband, farther, brothers in occasion of the Birthday, Anniversary, Father's day or Valentines.
100% HANDMADE
1. The most important in terms of quality is that we use full grain vegetable tanned leather for all our items which make them delightful to touch and to smell. As leather is a natural material, each toiletry bag varies slightly in texture and color and has a character all its own. This bag will wear beautifully over time which will give every bag that vintage character and their unique patina.
2. The leather is hand-dying, hand-cut, hand-punched and hand-stitched. The color is patiently applied with a pad so I can give to the leather wonderful nuances and a beautiful antique effect thereby making each creation unique in its kind.
3. The edges are hand smoothed, rounded and patiently polished with a brush for a longer life and make them more pleasant to the touch.
4. The sturdy waxed cotton thread used for the stitching and the manual sewing method ensures maximum durability of the bag. 
5. COMPARTMENT: With 1 huge compartment to hold all the toilet requisites, this cosmetic bag is definitely designed for your needs. It was fully lined in a water resistant fabric and equipped with genuine leather zipper pull and brass zipper closure. Because of its dimensions, it fits easily in your tote or luggage and exactly a perfect companion on your travel trip.
6. DIMENSION:
Length: 9”(22.86cm), Width: 4""(10cm) , Height: 4"" (10cm)
 
NOTE
We can personalize this bag for you with monogram, initials or name engraved on the exterior. We engrave everything for free! You can choose the font of the initials (see the fifth picture) and the size of them. Just write me the initials or name in “add notes to the seller” part during the checkout or send me an e-mail. Please pay attention that the right format of monogram is that the last initial is in the middle place, enlarged, and the middle initial will be put in the last place.

            Bag for laptop
Leatherette thick, it is doubled with a cotton polyester velvet appearance so that your computer or Tablet is well protected.

The bag closes with a closing zip. The two handles are short for a better grip.
