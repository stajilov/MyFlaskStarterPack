750,"Open Back Flower Girl Dress, Lace Rustic Flower Girl Dress, Country Flower Girl Dress, Tulle Tutu Flower Girl Dress, Sweetheart Dress","
            Open back with sweetheart cut top in off white. Stunning sweetheart cut top with lace floral overlay. Pearls adorn the closure of the open back. Our signature handcrafted attached burlap rose chest embellishment adorns the chest of this gown. If you prefer another style embellishment let us know, we can create something for you!
Skirt is made from chic off white tulle & lined through skirt with satin white slip.
Handcrafted attached tulle sash boosts a tulle bow, sash can be tied around the back so bow falls under the open back, or can be tied around the front so bow sits under sweetheart neckline, can even be worn to the side of hip. If you prefer another color tulle or a satin sash instead we can do that!
We are working on a more ivory tone for this design but it will not release until mid spring, the current off-white tone is perfect and falls between both white & light ivory in certain lighting
All measurements are given in inches and are approximate due to material being hand cut during production.

            A boxed set of 2 vintage ladies handkerchiefs - box measures approximately 17cm square with a depth of approximately 4cm
The handkerchiefs are as new; they were only removed from the box so that I could photograph them.  As I do not want to unfold the hankies I am unable to provide measurements so please take this into account.
The first 'lower' handkerchief is a plain pale pink whilst the top one is white with a pretty lace trim of nylon.  A pale pink material rose with green leaves makes a pretty visual addition and ties in the two colours.
Although the handkerchiefs are unused the box is showing quite a lot of wear;  it has considerable  'crushing' and is out of shape, there is also wear to the edges and marks to the base. 
The base of the box has a small paper label which reads '2 All Cotton Made In UK'
The handkerchiefs would look lovely removed from the box and gift wrapped. An ideal bridal wedding accessory, gift or they would make a pretty addition to a handbag. 
I will refund any overcharge on p&p costs for this item less, depending on the size of the item and the packaging materials used, 40p-80p.

It has line drawings of famous London sights such as the Tower of London, Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. It's very apparent how modern day designers such as Cath Kidston have been inspired by these types of mid century print. The handkerchief measures approx. 11""  (28cm) x 11"" (28cm).

this phone is a brownish-pink in colour with tan, black, and red parts on the bottom.
this phone has the handset and dial all in one, there is a rotary dial and ""hang up"" button set into the bottom of the phone.
this phone is UNTESTED, I cannot be sure it works as it is a WIRED phone. I have opened it up, and there are wires inside, but they have been snipped brutally short, up near the top of the handset. 
it may be repairable if you have the skills, but i can't guarantee it, and can't guarantee it works. This handset is being sold as-is, for display/excellent conversation piece!! 
handset is about 8 3/8"" tall, and is in very good condition, no chips or cracks to the plastic, just a few small scuffs and very minor surface scratches here and there. 
please ask any questions you may have! thanks!

(ââââ For ALL FAQ,please checkhttps://www.etsy.com/teams/20454/renzbridal ââââ) 
â I have 5 flower girls who would order dress from you, is it better for this many dresses to be placed in one same order or separate . 
1. If you want to make all the dresses in a same color, I suggest one of you would organize the information and place the order to avoid any color difference due to different dye lot. 
Honestly it's MUCH better for this many dresses to reserve a place in my schedule just for your wedding. If they order individually, then they'll get inserted in my schedule here and there, in-between other weddings I'm doing. 
2. If you want the dresses in different colors(each one has a special color), You can order the dresses separately (one by one). 
â Whatâs the difference of âStandardSize Length 1â VS âStandardSize Length 2â under the drop down menu of ""length&custom"" ?
1. Each Standard size has two different length, Length 1 and Length 2(length 1 is shorter than length 2), for example, if you want to choose Size 5T, length 1 based on my size chart. Then choose ""standardSize Length 1"" when you check out. 
Please check my size chart to see different length for different size. 
For Standard Size, please check the size chart below for details.
https://img0.etsystatic.com/126/0/6300657/il_fullxfull.926930450_f477.jpg
â Can this dress be made without rosette, can we add straps, flowers, sleeves, can we combine designs from two different dresses?
Yes, we're very flexible. But please double-check with me first. There will be an extra fee for a style change.
The better way is:
If the dress is not exactly what you want, then send me a dress design with the exact final look you want (it doesn't matter if it's from other source or an edited photo), and we can confirm if we can make it or not.
â How do I indicate the size and color information, etc.? 
You can add an optional message (size, color, or other custom) to me in the ""Note to Etsy Store"" section.
If you do not know where this section is, then please check Step 2 in the following link: 
http://www.etsy.com/help/article/339
â Can this dress be made in a different color?
For our flower girl dresses, some can be made in a difference color, but some only available in one color as pictured. Please check the possibility from âTEM INFORMATIONâ
â How long will it take to make my dress(es)-?
Normally 4-6 weeks, varies by season. If itâs the busy season, then the turnaround time will be longer. Check the following link for updated turnaround times (please check âShipping Timeâ) 
https://www.etsy.com/your/shops/RenzRags/policies
â Are your dresses able to be tailored/altered once I receive them?
Yes, I make the dresses with extra fabric inside so they can be easily let out. We have created a PDF file for this, with exact instructions. Feel free to request the PDF if you want to see it. 
â Can you supply any kind of swatch? Such as chiffon, sequin, Soft Tulle and lace.
Please check the possibility as follows:
