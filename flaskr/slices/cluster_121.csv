845,Crystal Rhinestone Open Bezel Set Necklace Dangle Earrings,"
            Gorgeous vintage dangling rhinestone necklace and dangling earring set. The open bezel set crystals really give this set an extra touch of glamour! It's an unsigned piece, though similar have been labeled Juliana or D & E. I have not confirmed this. The set is well made.
There is no loss to the gold tone on the earrings or the necklace. The earring's rhinestones are crystal clear and bright. The front of the necklace is also crystal clear and bright. Towards the back of the necklace there are some darker rhinestones. They are in the first 3 inches of on the ends. It's not a focal point, but please look at the photos before buying to see if it will bother you. I have taken this into consideration on the pricing.
The necklace measures approximately 15 1/2 inches from end to end. The drop is approximately 1  1/2 inches wide, depending on how the dangles fall by approximately 3 inches tall.
Your beautiful set will be well wrapped and shipped with insurance and tracking.

1885,Florida Map Florida Railroad Antique State Original 1920s,"
            A beautifully detailed map of Florida taken from a 1923 atlas. This map includes the layout of the railroads around Florida, which are shown in red. The entire map page is approximately 10"" x 13-1/8"" and the map image is about 8-5/8"" x 10"".
This is an ORIGINAL and not a reproduction.
* There is some light waviness in the paper along the bottom left border of this map page.  There is some light creasing in the top left corner of this map page.  There are some light impressions in some of the paper of this map page.  There is some light browning to this map page from age.  Please note that the map image on this map page is very slightly offset with the edges of the paper which can be concealed with matting before framing.  There is some text along the right edge of the map image which can be concealed with matting before framing.  The colors in the photos are close but not exact.  
On the reverse side of this map page is a map of Connecticut.
________________________________________________________________________________
Please note that I am selling other maps, including

This map was carefully removed from the atlas, and trimmed square with a sharp, heavy duty paper trimmer.
Until shipping, this map is laying flat in a large drawer. Upon shipping, this map will be carefully rolled and wrapped and placed in a stiff tube.
Please see the zooms of all of the photos for more information on this specific map.

3591,Vintage Fishbone Lollapalooza 1993 Concert T  FREE SHIPPING,"
            Great Vintage Fishbone T shirt from the 1993 Lollapalooza Tour,  what an awesome show, with other great bands like Concrete Blond, who didn't last.
  Fishbone was formed in L.A. in 1979 as an Alternative Rock Fusion band.  Original members John Norwood Fisher on bass, and his brother Phillip ""Fish"" Fisher on drums along with Angelo Moore, also known
as ""Dr. Madd Vibe"" doing vocals, sax, and theramin, Kendall Jones on guitar, ""Dirty"" Walter Kibby II vocals and trumpet. Christopher Dowd,  who used the pseudonym ""Charlie Down"" was on keyboards, trombone,and vocals.   John Norwood Fisher, Angelo Moore and 
and Kibby still exist in today's 2014 Fishbone.  
Although Fishbone had a cult following established in the L.A. area clubs, and were  signed by such giants as Sony, they never acheived superstardom but continue to have a faithful following.  They are termed ska, punk, fusion, alternative, hard rockand soul.  Their varied identifiers may be the reason why, hard to pin down but -they don't care!  
With the Monkey as the Sun,  ""Center of the Universe""  - at least, our Universe- he shines brightly as the focal point, on the blackness of space background- with planets, stars, and comets, and moon  swirling  by.  And don't miss the Fishbone logo on the bottom R, of the
front-  fish skeleton in a half darkened planet, guess it's the moon.  Saturn floats on the lower hem as well. 
  This T shirt was mine, only one owner and not worn much as only to yoga occasionally as it's really too big for me.  More like a knee length shirt on me.  
Fishbone's 1993 Album was titled that:  Give a Monkey a Brain and He'll Swear He's the Center of the Universe.

3941,"Dooney and Bourke Handbag - Vintage Dooney and Bourke, Leather Purse, Dooney and Bourke Purse, All Weather Leather, Cream and Tan Purse","
            Dooney and Bourke Handbag - Nice cream and tan colored vintage Dooney and Bourke Handbag.  I believe the bag is all-weather leather and is primarily a cream colored with a pebble texture and has light brown/tan accents.  There are 4 brass feet on the bottom and it comes with a brass hang tag.  This handbag measures approximately 12"" across X 10"" tall X 3.5"" deep.
This purse can be used as either a shoulder or crossbody purse as it has a removable crossbody strap.  The exterior of the purse is in good condition, with a few marks and scuffs consummate with age and use. The interior has a zipper pocket with credit card holders on the side, which is in good condition, but the bottom of the bag is in rather more worn/used condition and is very stained (see photo 3).  I have not tried to clean it, so I do not know if this would clean up or not.  The bottom of the bag is also split (this is only in the suede lining and I am not sure if this is normal).  This is still a very usable bag and the neutral colors will make it a suitable accessory for many outfits.
Processing time is 1-2 business days.  Please remember that colors vary slightly between computer monitors so the actual product may have a slightly different coloring than what you see on your screen.  The listing is for the Dooney and Bourke Handbag only.  Any other items seen in the photos are for display or size reference purposes only and not included in the Listing.

BAG DIMENSIONS:
Length, 12"" / Height, 8.5"" / Width, 3.5"" / Strap Drop, 13-15""
Beautiful vintage Dooney And Bourke Hobo bag - made in USA!  This is a small bag, in near mint condition.  Black and British Tan color combination, solid brass hardware, original duck fob attached, zipper top opening, brass feet, and classic good looks!
Exterior leather is in near perfect condition.  Minor wear present on bottom piping, showing some darkening to the corners of the leather.  Some surface marks on the very bottom of the bag.  Underneath of strap shows minor darkening to leather.  The rest of the bag shows no wear.  Brass hardware in great shape.
Interior of bag is clean, with an organization pocket and the red, white and blue serial number tag in tact inside.  
This is a smaller hobo, but can still fit all your essentials and a little bit more.  Shoulder strap is adjustable for a custom fit, and the brass feet protect the bottom, and keep the bag stable so you can find what you need with ease.  This would be a great every day bag, and can be dressed up or down.  Love it!

5641,"Vintage Dobbs Shantung Woven Fedora, Steel Blue Fedora, 7 3/8","
            This Dobbs Shantung woven fedora is a beautiful steel blue with a black band. It is in perfect condition! There is a white paper tag inside that shows no evidence of wear.
I bought this from another Etsy shop in my early days of hat collecting, when I wasn't quite sure of my size. I fell hard in love wit the color. Imagine my disappointment when the box came and this beauty was too big. *sigh* I know someone out there will feel the same way, and perhaps know their hat size better!
This comes with the original shop storage box. The box has a few spots on it and is a bit worn here and there, but it's still great for storage. If you can ever take the hat off, that is! It was stored in a closet with linens and scented candles, and has a bit of a candle scent. So do the linens, for that matter. Not bad it you like that kind of thing, but I'm airing it out in case you don't.

Tag reads size 7 3/8 
*Please note that the hat band has come off the seam.*
India Shriners of Oklahoma City was chartered in 1894 – not long after the parent organization was founded. The history of the Shriners goes back to the 1870s when a group of Masons gathered frequently for lunch at the Knickerbocker Cottage on Sixth Avenue in New York City. A particularly fun-loving group of men who gathered regularly for lunch. The group frequently talked about starting a new fraternity for Masons – one centered on fun and fellowship, more than ritual.
One of the founding members had been to France, and had been invited to a party given by an Arabian diplomat. The exotic style, flavors and music of the Arabian-themed party inspired him to suggest this as a theme for the new fraternity. The group drafted the ritual, designed the emblem and costumes, formulated a salutation and declared that members would wear the red fez, the hat synonymous with the Shriners today.

15752,"Organic Kombucha SCOBY kombucha culture ""Scoby / Mushroom"" fresh with strong starter tea. Includes directions! Make your own kombucha","
            *****If you purchase 3 SCOBYs I’ll give you a fourth SCOBY free ***
I'm an avid home Kombucha brewer; we sell our Kombucha locally.  (If you happen to live between Central Pennsylvania and Philadelphia and are interested in Kombucha, please contact me - we deliver to your doorstep) 
Included in our carefully packaged starter kit is:
-One live, organic, health SCOBY (Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast) 3 to 4 inches in diameter
-½ cup of starter tea
-Instructions on how to make your own Kumbucha
-I am passionate about Kombucha and will be more than happy to answer any questions you have along your brewing process.  
We only use organic ingredients – organic sugar, organic tea and non-fluorinated chlorine-free structured water.  
We grow our SCOBYs in glass containers.
All SCOBYs look a little different – each SCOBY will be about 3 to 4 inches in diameter.  The pictures of the SCOBYs are our ‘perfect’ looking ones.  All healthy organic SCOBYs work just the same whether perfect looking or ‘ugly.’ 
One 3 to 4 inch SCOBY is enough if you plan to brew ½ gallon.
If you are going to brew a gallon container I’d recommend 2 of our SCOBYs and if a 2 gallon container I’d recommend 4. 
Some sellers say one SCOBY is enough for a 2 gallon container, but most costumers find it takes a really long time to brew Kombucha if you start with only one SCOBY.
 
 *****If you purchase 3 I’ll give you a fourth one free ***
As SCOBY’s are perishable, we only ship on Monday and Tuesdays to make sure they aren’t stuck in the mail over the weekend.
Kombucha is an ancient fermented, probiotic tea beverage. Kombucha has been revered as a healing tonic for millennia. It is believed to provide healthful micronutrients and bacteria beneficial to digestion, detoxification and immunity. Worldwide, people make and drink kombucha for the way it makes them feel, alive, healed and replenished.
Ancient Chinese called it the “Immortal Health Elixir"". Kombucha has been around for more than 2,000 years and has a rich history of health benefits like preventing and fighting cancer, arthritis, and other degenerative diseases. In the first half of the 20th century, extensive scientific research was done on Kombucha’s health benefits in Russia and Germany, mostly because of a push to find a cure for rising cancer rates. Russian scientists discovered that entire regions of their vast country were seemingly immune to cancer and hypothesized that the kombucha, called “tea kvass” there, was the cause. So, they began a series of experiments which not only verified the hypothesis, but began to pinpoint exactly what it is within kombucha which was so beneficial.
Some of Kombucha health benefits:
- liver detoxification
- improved pancreas function
- increased energy
- better digestion
- improved mood (helps with anxiety/depression)
- kills Candida (yeast)
- helps nutrient assimilation
- weight loss
Shipping is 6 for one, but if you purchase more than one shipping is only 3 additional each.
