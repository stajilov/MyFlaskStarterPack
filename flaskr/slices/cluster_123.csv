4951,"Josef Originals ENGLAND Doll, from the Little Internationals series","
            Sweet little Miss England, from the Josef Originals Little Internationals series of highly collectible figurines, wears a lovely full-skirted dress in brown and green with gold accents. Her green bonnet has gold trim on the edges (slightly faded but this does not detract from the overall look of the piece). Always up for a bit of fun, she carries a golden hoop, ready to play. 
This charming figurine has many of the sought-after characteristics of the early designs of Muriel Joseph George, the founder of Josef Originals: black eyes, delicate features including one hand that is separate from the body (the other hand is holding the hoop), and a sweet demure expression on the face. 
Missing is the Josef Originals sticker and a hang tag. There is no sticker identifying the country, as some dolls have. On the bottom the company mark is stamped, not incised. 
Size: Just shy of 4 inches tall; 3 inches in diameter across the widest part of the skirt.
Condition: Excellent vintage condition with no chips, cracks, repairs, or visible flaws. She could perhaps use a little gentle cleaning, but I will leave that to the new owner.
Please contact me with any questions and thank you for looking!

6487,"Blue Flower Garden Adult Bib Clothes Protector Shirt Saver Dignity Wear, Nursing Home, Special Needs, Messy Eater, Pregnancy Bib","
            For someone in the nursing homes, people with special needs, our beloved elderly friends and family members, pregnant ladies, to wear while applying make-up, or for messy eaters.
I will put my best into producing the highest quality, be it in materials or craftsmanship. ""Blue Flower Garden"" bib features 100% cotton top backed with terry cloth, or comes as 3-layer construction, backed with complimentary cotton fabric of my choice, and interlined with low loft quilt batting. 3-ply will be the thickest.
My bibs come in two sizes, Regular and Large.
REGULAR size offers coverage and protection of the chest area and down. It measures 23 1/2"" long from top to bottom, 15"" from the bottom of the neck to the bottom of the bib, and 14-15"" wide.
LARGE size bib offers complete coverage and protection. It will go down onto your lap. It measures 30"" long from top to bottom, 21"" from the bottom of the neck to the bottom of the bib, and is 16"" wide.
You get to choose whether it will be closed with 1 or 2 sets of large plastic snaps (like metal ones, but do not rust or bang in the dryer), or a strip of soft non-scratchy velcro. If you choose velcro -- IT IS VERY IMPORTANT -- velcro needs to be closed for laundering and when not in use.
My bibs are unique because of the one-of-a-kind designed by me velcro protection. Given a chance, velcro will catch on terry cloth. Not in my bibs! You will see in photo 4 that the under side of the shoulder that goes over the hooked part of the velcro is protected with cotton fabric, so no snags as you are trying to close your bib.
Will comfortably will fit teen to adult, unless you are buying for a very large person, but you could request to customize the size. 
You can also purchase the add-on of a crumb catcher for extra protection here:
