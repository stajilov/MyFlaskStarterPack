1966,Vintage 4 Ft. Fairy Land Aluminum Christmas Tree with Vintage On-A-Lite Color Wheel (Inventory CH537),"
            Cute little 4 ft. aluminum Christmas tree! This is the ""Fairy Land"" tree made by Craft House Trees of Chicago. Tree has 28 limbs that measure 17"" long, has a 2 piece slender wood center pole, and tri-pod type base. Aluminum is straight needle type and does not have pom ends. 
The color wheel is a ""Magic, Revolving Color Ball"" and was made by On-A-Lite Corporation of Peoria, Illinois. Somewhat unusual color wheel. Works fine with small amount of rotation noise (normal for this type wheel).
Tree has original box with honeycomb type storage unit, wheel also has original box. 
Please note: These items will be shipped in two boxes and the listed shipping cost is a best guess estimate. I refund any overage above 2.00 whether it is a single item purchase or multiple items in a single transaction. 
If we are unable to locate a shipping box of the needed size, we will construct/build a shipping box for our aluminum trees -- these boxes are not especially pretty but are designed to protect the integrity of the original boxes (they are also suitable for storage of your tree).

- Country of Origin: South America
- Plant Part: Balsam
- Method of Extraction: Steam Distilled
- Color/Consistency: Yellow to Brown Color with Medium Consistency
Copaiba essential oil is distilled from trees in the Copaifera genus, commonly found in the Amazon rainforest of South America. The Copaifera trees secrete a sticky, vicious, transparent resin called Oleoresin, which is steam distilled to create copaiba essential oil.
Copaiba essential oil is known as one of the world's most powerful anti-inflammatory substances. Copaiba essential oil is unique in its composition and properties and contains many micro-nutrients. Copaiba is safe to be taken internally and is often used for pain relief, internally and externally.
Copaiba contains about 55-60% B-Caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene found in many essential oils, however mostly with a much smaller percentage. Sesquiterpenes recode fault information in cellular memory that can cause disease. Sesquiterpenes also cross the blood brain barrier. When substances are able to cross the blood brain barrier, they become beneficial to the brain as well as the rest of the body.
Uses: Antibacterial, Anti-inflammatory, Disinfectant, Diuretic, Expectorant, Stimulant

13711,Lucky sixpence bridal gift something blue traditional good luck charm,"
            A lucky sixpence to present to a bride to be.
Something old, something new,
Something borrowed, something blue,
And a silver sixpence for her shoe.
It was customary for the brides father to present his daughter with a sixpence to put in her shoe on her wedding day. Now, wonderful as fathers are on their daughter's wedding day, I think this custom passes many of them by these days!
This is a gorgeous gift to present to a bride before her wedding day and ensure that she will have the lucky sixpence (perhaps not in her shoe!) to go along with her old, new, borrowed, blue items. The ivory organza bag contains a genuine British sixpence along with a heart shaped sequin (blue, of course!) and the traditional verse printed on ivory card.
It is gift wrapped and ready to present. Gift wrap is a cello bag with white flowers
I presented one of these to a friend recently and she tied it to the inside of her dress.  The bag can also be used to carry any other (small) items to complete the verse above.
Please convo for larger quantities and I will set up a custom listing.
For a more personalised gift option, please have a look at the framed sixpence keepsake gift.
http://www.etsy.com/listing/76579400/sixpence-keepsake-gift-personalised
The sixpence comes with a frame that can be used to mount the sixpence after the wedding day and is printed with the bride and groom's names and the date of their wedding.
It is also possible to purchase an upgrade option for this sixpence:

            Turkish Spindle Club membership - Standard Edition Spindles (annual subscription, four spindles)
My Standard Edition Turkish Spindle subscription club is your opportunity to build a collection of some unique and beautiful spindles. You can join at any time and your subscription will run from the next 3 monthly spindle issue. 
The first photo is of Edition #4 mailed Dec 2016, made in Tulip Oak. Photos 2&3 show issue #3, photo 4 is Issue 2 made in lace Blackheart Teatree on a Gidgee shaft, photo 5 shows issue #1 made in spalted Native Tamarind and Mulga.
Balancing is an aspect of my spindles I take care and pride in, and each spindle is individually tested for balance and adjusted for best spin by carefully removing wood from the heavier side of the cross arms. The fit of the cross arms to the shaft is another area where I take special care. All spindles are tested for spin with and without fibre.
The whorls are hand finished with extra fine abrasive and all edges smoothed. The whorls are finished with two coats of ""Organoil"" - a tung oil blended with several citrus oils that protects the wood, leaves a silk finish and a slight fragrance of citrus.
The club commenced in December 2015.  Weights will vary but I plan the range to be broadly in the 0.5 to 1.25 oz range.
Many of the woods selected for the club issues will be rare or have especially attractive figure. The club releases will be in December (starting with issue #1 in 2015), February, May, and September.  I will attempt to ensure each club release is sent out by around the middle of the month.
There will also be special offers from time to time available only to spindle club members, visit the members area of my website at www.thespindleshop.net  to find these. As a club member you can register on my website for privileged access to the Spindle Club area on that website.
Spindle club members have special and valued role in my business. Your support allows me the time and funds to develop new designs, and allows also me to find unusual and high quality materials that may not be common from other suppliers. As a club member, in return for your annual subscription and the support this gives my work, you will receive periodic deliveries which will build into a special collection of unique work. 
Airmail postage and packing are added by the Etsy shopping cart and vary with country of residence. Deliveries will commence immediately if the current issue is still available or up to about a couple of months later if you have just missed a model issue.        ",250.00,4.9966,"Handmade item

15020,4 Four Fiber Artist Supply Company Top Whorl Drop Spindle,"
            Welcome to the etsy home of Fiber Artist Supply Company! We're a small manufacturer of handcrafted knitting and weaving supplies located in Cincinnati, OH. Founded in 2007 in Chicago, IL, we have been working hard ever since to bring high-quality, yet reasonably priced solid hardwood supplies to our customers.
 
These are very popular among spinning instructors in search of an inexpensive beginner spindle. We take care ensuring these spindles spin true, giving every spindle a test spin prior to shipment. The conical shape of the maple whorl puts additional weight around the rim, helping the spindle spin longer and stay more stable. A notch in the whorl helps keep your spun yarn in place. The spindles are individually crafted in our Cincinnati, OH workshop of maple and beech from domestic and international sources.  The spindle is 10"" long, rounded on both tips, has a 2.5"" whorl, and weighs 1.8 ounces. 
This item is individually handcrafted in our Cincinnati, OH workshop.
Yarn shop owners and spinning instructors: The Fiber Artist Supply Company sells many of these spindles wholesale. Look for our larger bulk packs in our store or at our website.        ",17.99,4.9696,"Handmade Supply
