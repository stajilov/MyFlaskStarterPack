918,Antique Victorian Silver Locket with Assyrian Winged Lamassu Lion in Relief,"
            Antique Victorian sterling silver locket with a winged Assyrian lion on the front, dating to the later 1800's.
This is a highly unusual and stunning large locket, perfect for anyone with an interest in history!  The applied engraved relief on the front of the locket is an Assyrian Winged Lion with a human face, known as a Lamassu and possibly based on the example in the British museum.  In this case though the head is turned to face the viewer rather than being in profile, which is more usual for this figure.     The Lamassu was traditionally placed in a pair near or at the entrance to a throne room or other important location where it was viewed as being a protective figure.
The rear cover is plain, while inside both frames are intact (though degraded) with one glass window intact, as well as the original silk lining, which is a little worse for wear and could be replaced.  There are no dents or damage to the silver, only a slight 'dint' in one place on the rear cover.   The hinge is sound and works fine and the locket closes with a good click, holding securely.  The applied Lamassu on the front is held in place by three 'studs' which protrude through the front locket cover and are fixed in place by wire (recently replaced and secure).  Not hallmarked but tested as sterling silver.
Size:  Height including bale: 2 2/8"" or 60mm, excluding bale:  1 2/8"" or 45mm.  Width: 1 3/8"" or 35mm

History
This piece was made circa 1880 during the Victorian era, a period in English history defined by the reign of Queen Victoria, from 1837 to 1901. Posy rings, on which a romantic verse was engraved within the band, are first seen in the 12th century but were highly popular as betrothal or wedding rings in the 17th and 18th centuries. This Victorian wedding ring borrows from this tradition with a truly romantic message of requited love, a classic antique wedding ring with a romantic history.

This incredible panel has exquisite crochet lace and embroidered cutwork plus an extravagant swagged hemline with more lace and tassel fringes. It is a stunning drape that probably dates to the early 1900s, circa 1910s - 1930s.
This breathtaking panel would make a really lovely addition to your French country or rustic interior dÃ©cor scheme. 
Dimensions: It is 57.5 inches long at the longest point including the tassel (146 cm)  and 59 inches (150 cm) wide 
The oval panels are 17.5 x 10.5 inches (44.5 x 26.5 cm)
The tassels are 4.5 inches long (11.5 cm) 
Weight 210g
Condition: it is an old, delicate textile and has some signs of use. It is a little yellowed and has a number of small holes and 2 short tears (less than 1 inch long) which, in my opinion, do not detract from its beauty or useability. There are small holes in the lightweight cotton and some breaks in the ""chasse"" and ""peche"" panels.
The shipping quoted includes tracking, insurance and delivery.

2375,Victorian Hand Brooch Bog Oak Hand Holding Wreath of Roses and Wheat Symbolic Brooch,"
            Victorian hand brooch made of bog oak which originates from the peat bogs in Ireland. The hand image was very popular in Victorian jewelry from approx 1860-1890.  Depending on what images are with it, would often determine it's meaning.  This one has the hand holding a wreath of roses. The roses symbolize love and the wreath was symbolic of hope and eternal life.  The hand is also holding wheat sheaves. Nicely detailed.
Bog oak was used as on of many black materials during the Victorian era. It is easier to tell because it has some brown coloring and has a bit of a woody texture. 
This one is a bit larger in size than some. It measures 3"" x 1 1/4"".
The condition is good - it has survived the past century very well. There are no chips, cracks or problems. The brooch has a C-style pin clasp which is sturdy and in working order.
A wonderful piece to wear and a lovely addition for your collection...
Enjoy!        ",145.00,4.9792,"Vintage item from the 1800s

4797,Rhinestone Cat Eye Glasses Cateye Eyeglasses NOS Vintage Mink,"
            GENERAL
Beautiful New Old Stock Vintage Women's Cat eye glasses frames. They were never worn and are in mint condition. They are made in France by Selecta Optical. For more New Old Stock never used Vintage cat eye glasses, check out my Ebay store for a large selection.
CONDITION
These are New Old stock and were never worn. We have inspected them to make sure they are fully functional, can take your prescription lenses in them and are suitable for daily wear. They have been sitting in a box all these years and may need some adjustment by an optician before use.
SIZE
Width, between hinges: 4 7/8 inches
Temple Length: 5 1/2 inches
Lens Width: 44mm
Bridge: 22mm
This is a medium vintage size.
Most Vintage frames tend to run small. They were worn much closer to the face than today's frames. Cat eye glasses are no exception. While there are many factors affecting the size, the lens width is a good way to get a general idea. Lens size 42 and lower is considered small, 44 and 46 medium, 48 and above are large. Please make sure this size will work for you before ordering.
STYLE
Cat-eye glasses are a form of eyewear for women that were mainly popular in the 1950's and 1960's among fashionable women. Out of the small amount that were originally made, most are not around today and they are becoming harder to find. When you buy a pair of vintage cat eye glasses, you are not just getting something made yesterday and shipped overseas. You are wearing something that has been through life, an age different than our own, and survived till this day. Wearing vintage cat eye glasses assures that youâll stand out from the masses in a pair of glasses that brings out your individuality. 
PAYMENT

Returns are accepted within 14 days of delivery. We offer a money back guarantee if there was a mistake on our part or something was described wrong. Otherwise, store credit will be given for the purchase of any pair we sell of similar or lesser value.

            Mr. Prawn is an aqua brand and makes only hand-made products which are made of clay. 
Our brand concept is a coexistence of human and environment, so we only use environment-friendly material when we make our products.
Making products would take about one and two weeks since all are hand-made. 
We choose the color and size based on fishâs nature(habit), also we try that product in person after making it.
Corydoras are bottom dwelling catfish, so for them, i created holes everywhere to not disturb their movement.
As for cichlids, they fight aggressively for territory, therefore, i created individual spaces for them.

10594,Clair de Lune by Claude Debussy Handwritten Sheet Music: Classical Print,"
            Claude Debussyâs Clair de Lune has a stunning melody evoking images of summer moonlit nights.  I tried to create a classical look of a first manuscript, with hastily penned notes, uneven bars, blotted staff lines, and even mistakes.  The beauty of this sheet music is not in its perfection, but in its originality.  This piece contains Debussyâs original music written to fill 1 sheet of parchment paper.  
This listing is a high quality print.  The template, like all my sheet music, is hand drawn with a dip pen and acrylic ink.  This sheet music is then scanned into a high resolution image and printed on various materials for a more authentic look and feel.  I created an original template which I use only for these prints.  Read more about my process in my about page.
The sheet music is wrapped in acid-free vellum and sealed with my signature black and champagne treble clef for the perfect gift.  Treat yourself or a loved one to a remarkably unique decoration, perfect for any home.
Available on white cardstock, cream cardstock, or classic parchment paper.
DIMENSIONS:
8.5 x 11 parchment paper
0.3 oz.
This frame can be purchased as an option.  To purchase another frame shown with a different piece please contact me.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

            Designed to be stylish and eye catching, but not too flashy.  I wanted it to be a handsome everyday ring that a guy would want to wear.  It's now become my most popular ring.
The Black Walnut contrasts nicely with the Wild Cherry, and the polished brass gives it just a little flash.  
The band is 8.5mm wide, or about 5 US Quarters. The band has a very comfortable rounded face, and rounded edges. The inside of the ring is slightly rounded for comfort. The band is approximately 2.5mm thick. (about two US dimes) 
BEAUTIFUL RING - EXCELLENT SERVICE - DELIVERED ON TIME - GUARANTEED
HOW WOOD RINGS ARE MADE
The two sides of the ring are bonded through the brass insert. This locks all the pieces together, and makes a very strong ring.
Each ring is finished with a tough acrylic, and polished to a brilliant shine. This makes the rings waterproof and suitable for daily wear.
CUSTOMIZED WOOD RINGS
If you have a custom request, just send me a message. I'll be glad to work with you.
SIZING YOUR WOOD RING
The wood rings are slightly rounded on the inside for a ""comfort fit"". They tend to run about a half size larger than standard rings. So if you prefer a nice snug fit, subtract a half size from your normal size.
SHIPPING 
Shipping is free worldwide. When shipping outside the United States, you are responsible for any duties or taxes your country may charge.
WOOD RING WARRANTY
When your wood ring arrives, I hope you love it. And, I hope you're glad you chose my shop. If not, let me know! I'll make you happy. Won't fit; no problem. Clashes with your eye color; no problem. Allergic to wood; no problem. I'll make you happy, or refund your money. Period        ",145.00,4.8462,"Handmade item

How to clean the shawl:
Clean by gently placing in cool water and a specialist delicate soap such as SOAK or Eucalan and allow to soak for 30 minutes, no vigorous rubbing is needed. Gently squeeze out the excess water (do not wring), place on a clean towel and roll it up then press down gently on the towel to soak up as much as possible. Lay out flat on a clean surface, using pins and/or blocking wires to gently stretch the shawl out to shape and maintain its beauty.
Want to buy as a gift?
All my shawls are sent out in a brand new sturdy white cardboard box with tissue paper surrounding the shawl for protection and a couple of other special little packaging details that you only get when buying handmade. The box is then placed in a shower proof mail bag prior to dispatch. This is my standard packaging and I don't charge extra for this. If you're buying as a gift you won't need to gift wrap and they won't guess what it is until they open the box.        ",39.80,5.0,"Handmade item

American Button MachinesÂ® in an Authorized distributor for Tecre Co, Inc button machines and supplies. Over the years, we have sold to thousands of Etsy customers from our main website, www.AmericanButtonMachines.com.  We are huge fans of the Etsy marketplace and due to popular demand, decided to open our own Etsy store to give our customers one more avenue to purchase button making supplies. 
We only sell brand new authentic Tecre button machines and paper cutters. All of our pinback button making supplies are proudly âMade in the USAâ and conform to the strictest US industry standard sizes. 
PLEASE NOTE: There are a lot of manufacturers that make proprietary sized buttons or they are manufactured outside the USA and do not conform to the US industry standard sizes. If you are unsure of what button machine you have or if our parts will work, please contact us before ordering. We are happy to help you (thatâs what makes our day complete!) find the correct sized buttons for your equipment.
We do NOT sell 1.25â, 2.25â or 3â Badge-a-Minit (BAM) sized button machines and their parts will not fit Tecre brand button makers that are made in the USA. Likewise, our button supplies will not work with BAM button machines or button machines that are made in China. 
Unless you have a photo button machine or photo punch, we recommend using a 24lb bond paper with a brightness of at least 100. If you use a thicker paper, you run the risk of jamming your machine or slightly deforming the buttons on the smaller sized buttons. 
VERY IMPORTANT: You must cut your graphic circle to a very specific size that will change depending on the diameter of the button you are making. The paper circle is always larger than the finished button because the paper wraps and crimps around the back of the button. For example, you cannot use a cheap 1â craft punch to cut graphics for your 1â buttons as the correct cut size is actually 1.313â. Not to worry, all of our paper cutters are made to the correct size and make it effortless to cut properly sized circles.        ",205.00,5.0,"Only ships within  United States .

16180,Prosthetic zombie jaw set,"
            This pack contains 1 zombie jaw and left/right cheek appliances.
These pieces are created using Fake-Up superior gelatine in flesh tone colour.
These pieces can be painted using alcohol activated paint or simply coat with fake blood for a realistic effect.  
Use fake-up adhesive (or pros-aide) and fake-up blender to apply the prosthetic piece. Latex can also be used, but will not bond the piece as well or as long the adhesive will.  
Third image shows the jaw used on a recent short zombie film.
Flesh colour may vary slightly from piece to piece. 
For more information, adhesives, blood and blenders, plus 'how to' guides, please visit: www.fake-up.co.uk
Disclaimer:
A patch test is required to ensure there is no reaction with the skin before a prosthetic is applied. Some people are allergic to latex so we advise using a water based adhesive such as 
pro-aide or fake-up adhesive. Should a reaction occur then discontinue application. Fake-Up will not be held responsible for any allergic reactions. Please read our application sheet that
is available to download on our website.        ",7.95,5.0,"Handmade item

18681,Black Men's Gilly Shoe,"
            This men's Gilly shoe is the perfect addition to any kilt wearer's wardrobe. No more combat boots for you! Really become authentic with this comfortable, American made, 100% leather shoe.
We only do full sizes so we recommend that you purchase a size up if you need a half size. For example, if you wear a 9.5, we suggest you order a 10. Also, these shoes run wide, but due to the lacing can be sinched down for a narrower foot as well. This design is very accommodating for all foot shapes. The shoes are completely leather so they are built to fit snug for the first few wears. They will stretch and contour with several hours of wear and body heat. Again, they should be tight (especially around the big toe) the first few times you wear them!
These shoes are able to be re-soled by any local cobbler and we guarantee them against manufacturer defects.        ",89.00,5.0,"Handmade item
