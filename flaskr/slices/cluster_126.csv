0,American Girl Doll Pleasant Company  ... Pre-Mattel Doll,"
            I'm not sure if this American Girl doll by Pleasant company is Samantha or possibly Just Like You #2 if anybody can clarify from the pictures please let me know.
This doll has the fuller face, softer eyelashes and lighter facial coloring compared to the Mattel dolls.
Her body is clean and limbs are tight. She has beautiful brown eyes and dark brown hair. The hair is in good condition but could use some TLC.        ",85.00,5.0,"Vintage item

4,SALE Pretty in Pink Sterling Co. Boudoir Doll,"
            This doll is 28"" tall and is one of the rare Sterling Co dolls from the 20's or early 30's. This one is very unusual because Sterling dolls have arm sockets and movable composition arms, but this one has hollow celluloid hands and cotton arms which go through the arm holes.The celluloid hands are very rare, I have only seen a couple of others. This looks to be this way originally from the factory, as she is wearing her original dress and it is nailed on to her. She has a wonderful costume with no holes and only a couple of slight water spots. Her composition is pretty good with splitting at the sides of her neck. She has some crazing on her chest and a very slight amount on her face. She has a couple of cracks at the corner of her eyes and slight restoration eyes and eyeshadow. She is also missing some of her eyelashes, but overall, she shows very well and none of these things detract, She has curley mohair and composition feet with black high heeled shoes, with her original pantaloons.
Was 235, Now 200.

7,"Bahr & Proschild doll, bru doll, antique doll, vintage doll, german doll, french doll, jumeau doll, Antique Reproduction, bisque doll","
            This is a truly beautiful doll that I have enjoyed having on display in my home.
She is an antique reproduction of a Bahr & Proschild doll mold 224 (dimples).  This doll is superbly done.  Bahr & Proschild  was a porcelain factory in Ohrdruf Thuringia Germany and made heads for Bruno Schmidt, Heinrich Stiers, Kley & Hahn and others from 1871 on.  These beautiful dolls were made in the similar style to the ever popular french dolls, and were very highly desired, esp. the closed mouth dolls.
Bahr & Proschild dolls produced before 1910 were marked with just their mold numbers.  This particular reproduction doll is created as such with a simple stamp of 224 on the back of her neck under her hair.  Also on her neck is her artist's name and date, stamped 1985.
This gorgeous doll is 16"" tall (minus hat/hair), features beautiful bright clear blue eyes, a wonderful full curly wig, a flawless bisque head and all bisque body, beautiful painting from face down to toes.
Her clothes, pantaloons, slip dress, hat, and lace dress are all handmade and are in beautiful condition.  She is wearing stockings but lacks some shoes.
Damage:  No significant damage or marking is on this doll.  Her arms are a bit loose.  The cording attaching her arms is in fine conditions, but seems to be strung just a bit too big for her.

1423,"Vintage Toy Klik It Poosh-M-Up Toy Pin Game, Marble Game, Vintage Game, Vintage Toy, WITH ORIGINAL BOX","
            DETAILS:
You have found a very cool vintage pin/marble game!  I invite you to take a good closer look at the photos to see the condition...it's incredible how great of shape it is in for its age. The white marbles you see in the photo are also included.  The playing surface from a heavy fiberboard material.  This is surrounded by a steel band.  There are Indians, numbers, and other figures displayed on the board.  There is a spring arm on the right side which shoots the marble into the main playing area...similar to a pinball machine.  However, this isn't a pinball game.  There are no levers on the side like a pinball game.  There is another metal piece at the bottom, in the middle of the game.  If the marble ends up in this area, the metal lever can shoot the marble straight back through the middle of the game.
The directions on the game read:
""Each player shoots all the marbles, one at a time. When a marble rolls into one of the ""Klickers"" it is replayed from that point until it gets into a scoring pocket.""
CONDITION:
There is some mild rust, which you can see in one of the photos.  It looks like this is the only part with rust (this is the end that has been sticking out of the box all these years.)
This game does come with the original box.  However, the box has seen better days, but perhaps since the game has been in it all these years, that is probably why the game is in great shape. 
APPROX MEASUREMENTS:
Without the box, the game itself measures 24"" long and 13"" wide.        ",85.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1930s

5798,Vintage Wide Brim Cartwheel Hat Avant Garde Art Deco Hat Navy with Blue Velvet Henry Ross Paris Designer Pancake Hat,"
            1950s revival of the cart wheel hat - or cartwheel hat. This one is amazing in navy blue straw with two tone blue velvet twisted trim and a rhinestone garnish. This hat is by new york/Paris designer, Henry Ross. A cartwheel hat (also cart wheel hat) is a wide brimmed circular or saucer-shaped design.  Typically, it is worn at an angle to show off the curve of the brim, rather than being worn at the back of the head in the manner of a halo hat. This one comes with a hat pin to help you keep it in place. 
Because these work into the hair style, they are designed to fit all head sizes. This measures 15 1/4 inches from front to back of brim. The back brim is narrower than the front. Condition is very, very good, with the slightest bit of soil to the ribbon (no more than what you can see in photo) and a pin hole in the ribbon from hat pin use. 
Enjoy... this is an amazing hat.        ",85.00,4.7874,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            ***PRIMP YOUR RIDE WITH OUR CAR SCENT AIR FRESHNERS***
Our car scents/aroma bead air fresheners are FABULOUS for your car or about anywhere you want to hang them. They have so many uses for them, hang them in your closet, bathroom, office, locker, camper, pantry, trashcan, by that stinky diaper pail, on your exercise equipment, cabinets, ooh and even a stinky gym bag! They work best in small areas. 
Common Q & A's~~
- What is it made of? They are a unique design made with small, plastic beads that absorb color and fragrance. Made with the maximum fragrance oil the bead can hold. The beads are not hollow, but absorb the scent & color.
-How long does the fragrance last? Well that actually depends on the fragrance itself. Softer scents will not last as long as stronger scents. On average the scent will last on average from 30-90 days. Comparable to the Little Tree car air fresheners. You will get used to the fragrance and not smell it anymore but others will. They will be stronger in the summer than the winter months as heat helps to dissipate the aroma.        ",7.00,4.8,"Handmade item

9583,Carnival Cruise Light Card® card key switch activator,"
            Several Carnival cruise ships use card key switches to conserve energy in guest cabins.
The Carnival suggestion is to use one of your room keys - which often results in a forgotten key when leaving the room.
So I have created the Light Card® card key switch activator!
It consists of a PVC card with artwork printed directly on the card (making it waterproof & long-lasting!) and a magnet on the back. 
Put it in the slot while you're in the room, and then pull it out and use the attached magnet to hang it on the wall above the slot while you're out. 
No more forgotten room keys!
~~Important! Be sure to remove completely when you leave, as stateroom hosts are in the habit of grabbing the card in the slot on the way out and in their haste may inadvertently take yours!
~~Also, be sure to hang on the wall above the card slot and not on the door - the motion of the door can cause the cards to slide and possibly fall off.
Can be used over and over for all your cruises using card key switch technology, and hung on your fridge as a memento in between!
Please note - ""How Many?"" will be multiplied by ""Quantity"" selected to give final amount of cards ordered. For example, if you select 2 under ""Quantity"" and then ""Set of 4 cards"" under ""How Many?"" you will be ordering 8 cards (2 x 4).
And don't forget luggage tags and lanyards!

15602,"Small Orgonite® generator Pyramid ""Price Reduced"" (Free small Pyramid with order)","
            Free small pyramid with order.  1 small chakra pyramid=1 free small pyramid.  2 small chakra pyramids =2 small pyramids etc!
For the month of April Pyramids are all reduced!
The small pyramid will consist of Quartz, Rose Quartz, Black Tourmaline, Stainless steel metal and copper bb's.   I will also be adding a charm to the pyramid.  Best place for this generator would be work desk, bedroom, computer, wifi router, smart meter, or even gifting to a friend.  The pyramids are made with quartz, rose quartz, black tourmaline, mixed  chakra crystals and stainless steel metal. 2.2 x 2.2 x 1.5 inches
The pyramids are hands down the most powerful Orgonite you can buy. They are a completely different energy then the pucks and any flat Orgonite pieces. The pyramids are potent because of the point; this focuses all of the energy into a tiny point.  This makes for an extremely precise flowing energy versus the flat shapes, that are know where near as focused, all work great though!  Any Orgonite works great, but the pyramids lead the way in every category of transmuting energy.  The pointer the Orognite the more the ability to work multidimensional. If yourself healing, the pyramids are for you because they focus on connection to all aspects of your being, precisely and focused.  The energy is incredibly calmer then any other shape which of course is amazing for mediation and any healing work.   The range of the pyramids are huge, they will cover your whole house, even a medium one.  The large pyramids are just an amazing energy tool to have in your house.  I would consider a large pyramid the most powerful tool I’ve ever worked with.  
Feeling better, both physically and spiritually. As energy blockages are healed and the energy around you starts to flow unobstructed, life feels more joyful and harmonious.
Relationships improve – for example, many people have gifted their homes or workplaces with Orgonite® , and they find that their relationships with family and co-workers improve.
Vivid dreams. This is an effect that many people I know, including skeptics, have experienced – although I haven’t experienced this myself. I suppose my dreams are already vivid enough as they are 🙂
Better sleep. Some people find trouble sleeping if they have in the room, as it might take some time to get used to the energised environment. In the long run though, it promotes good sleep, and many have reported that they have been cured of chronic insomnia with the help of orgonite. If you do find that Orgonite® makes it difficult for you to sleep in the beginning, keep it out of the bedroom until you are used to the energy.
Spiritual growth. This goes hand in hand with cleaner energy. An Orgonite® generaor house can be like a permanent spiritual retreat!
Protects from EMFs. This is one of the main benefits that draws people to it. It seems tha tOrgonite® generators does not reduce EMF per se, but instead protects your body from its harmful effects. Many people have felt instant relief from a simple pendant, although if you are very sensitive to electro-magnetic radiation, you may need to place more pieces of Orgonite®  generators around EMF-emitting devices (your fridge, computer, tv, clock radio, etc).
Accelerates plant growth. This is onebenefit which is pretty evident when tested. Check out my Orgonite®  plant growth experiments post for more info.
Cleaner water. Water which has rested on top of an prana generator harging plate tastes better and feels healthier too.
Purifies the atmosphere. Hence the popular practice of gifting Orgonite® generator to areas affected by EMF pollution.
Orgonite is a powerhouse as a spiritual tool and is a multidimensional tool that’s able to transcend anything of low vibration.  This includes a vast spectrum from electronics, wifi, cell phones, etc.  These devices also have the capacity to transcend old stuck stagnant energy from your physical and energy body that is not serving you.  Orgonite is an organic technology that has infinite potential.  An organic technology means it’s infinite like you.  This means it’s extremely compatible with you.  The technology we have today is extremely finite and has a threshold of limitations for a spiritual being.  
I call Orgonite the ultimate personal trainer because they work24/7 and you never need to clear them unless you feel the need too.  If you’re willing to work thru your journey, Orgonite can push you like no other tool I’ve ever come across by miles and miles and miles.  They create an ultimate channel to yourself eliminating anything that’s disrupting your connection to yourself.  
I have spent over eight years 24/7 researching the causes of why the disconnection has been disrupted from our higher selves.  Electronics on all spectrums from the scene to the unseen play an immense role.  Never have I had an actual solution to clear these frequencies until I discovered Orgonite.  Orgonite is uncommon for a reason!! They work like nothing I have ever come across by light-years.        ",13.00,5.0,"Handmade item

***IMPORTANT READ ABOUT:
Our Strict Disclaimer And Design Limitations Regarding Industry Standard Woven Labels. 
Please Note that woven labels are not like printed labels so it is not possible to do lots of stuff like giving shadow effect . Another issue is color matching, it is not possible to match the Pantone or other color matching,
we always try to match the best possible shade (if we don't find one then we will contact you before taking any step) This is industry standard for woven labels.
With weaving, it is impossible to have 100% detail to match your graphic art, as these are literally stitched/woven labels and NOT printed labels.  
The size after cut and folded finished both have -2mm tolerances. The colors of yarn can have tolerances of up to 15%.   please note that vertical line, horizontal line  circles, curves and slants are very tough with weaving, it will have a step to the next stitch line in the weaving process.
Also, some letters may be larger, etc.   
If you need 100% matching of fine detail, no color of yarn ""peeking"" through a white background from yarn, you need printed labels instead of premium woven. The yarn/threads of woven labels may have different thicknesses hence limitations to some fine detail.
By ordering woven labels you understand and agree with these industry standard tolerances and are approved by you the customer upon placing this order. The method of weaving labels involves moving parts and moving loom machinery and therefore the possibility of the above variances These are NOT printed labels!  While we try our best to avoid any tolerance, these tolerances above are industry standard for all woven labels.
We always carefully check all items before shipping. If you see any problem after receiving goods, please contact us first.  Please contact us before leaving any negative or neutral feedback. We will do our best to solve any problems.        ",85.00,4.9016,"Handmade Supply

Celtic Dogs.
Traditionally the dog was a symbol of courage, persistence, loyalty and friendship, as well as good luck and health, in Celtic culture.
A traditional Celtic design of two dogs (or hounds) intertwined. Celtic symbols honor the spirit of the Irish, the Scottish, the Welsh, the British, and anyone with Celtic heritage. The Celts looked to the beasts of the earth, sky, and sea to find teachers, friends, and healers. They believed the animals were there to teach them how to live in harmony with Nature itself. Through animal symbols, the Celts sought to commune with both the seen and the Unseen. Hounds were sacred to the faeries of Ireland and Scotland and thus were held in very high regard in both Celtic lands. These faithful protectors were the Celtic animal symbols of loyalty, devotion, and unwavering faith and love.        ",85.00,4.8896,"Handmade item

17435,"WOODS AND WILLOW!  Fine Silver Earrings Made from Real Weeping Willow Leaves, Artisan Earrings, Botannical Earrings","
            Finally!  I designed and handmade a piece of jewelry from one of my favorite leaves, the Weeping Willow (hence the name of my Etsy Shop - Woods and Willow).  These fingerlike leaves are so graceful and airy as they skim the surface of the lake or river from which they thrive.  The earrings are made of Fine .999% Silver and were traced perfectly from the actual Weeping Willow leaves I used.  They hang approximately 2 3/4"" from the Sterling Silver earwire.  They sway off the ear and have lots of movement.  I left them with a highly hand-polished, shiny finish, so they flash in the sunlight!
There are three Weeping Willow leaves on each earring and are so light in feel, just like the Willow leaf.
The Weeping Willow leaves give us the ability to express ourselves and is believed to put us in touch with our feelings and deep emotions.
Enjoy the design of these Fine Silver earrings and when wearing them, feel the strength they just may provide!

Which shoe size should I order?
Know Your ""True"" Size
If you're not really sure about your ""true"" shoe size, it's a good idea to find out before you order. The next time you're out shopping, stop by a specialty shoe store and have your feet measured by a professional. Get measured in the afternoon or evening since feet tend to swell throughout the day.
In-between Sizes
If you find you tend to be in-between sizes and you are going to order a shoe with a pointed toe, choose the bigger size. Then use a shoe pad under the ball of your foot for a snug, comfortable fit.
They are luxuriously created with quality materials and include satin, delicate lace and appliques by Pink2Blue. Please leave me your shoe size during check-out, thank you.

18775,Men's Gladiator Sandals / Chocolate Brown Handmade Sandal Greek Roman Medieval Viking Renaissance Flat Leather Lace Up Shoes,"
            This is the footwear you want to be wearing when you find yourself in an ancient Roman arena with a Lion!  Or maybe even when you just step out your front door to face the world and all of it's terrifying beasts. Our model *please see the last photo* broke in his new Gladiator sandals in the mud at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival! These sandals are durable enough for mud, sand, water, and anything else you can think of trudging though!
Our Chocolate Brown Gladiator Sandal is built with three tabs which run in between the leather base and Vibram sole, they then wrap around to cradle both sides of each foot. The lace is threaded through the tabs, crisscrossed over the top of the foot and can be tied several times around the ankle with a double knot, or laced up your leg and tied. The laces are fully adjustable for a comfortable fit.
The 1/4"" Vibram sole is a plastic/rubber blend and one of the best sole options on the market. Vibram is extremely soft and flexible and designed to mimic a barefoot feeling when you walk. During your first adventure with your new Maori sandal the Vibram sole will begin to mold to the shape of your foot for a naturally born custom fit.

      An evergreen classic!
  This is a truly premium sandal not only based on the incorporated materials, but also based on its build and design. We built in an orthopedic insert foam, which after using it a week or two
shapes itself after your footprint, gives a better lap for your feet dividing your body weight more evenly, so it is very cozy.
  The sole-leather part of this sandal is sewn to the rubber sole. In between the two, hid from our eyes run the strap-channels; this is not a fixed-strap sandal, but the straps run through these channels.
This gives the adjustable feature of the sandal. Not only the part around your toe and around your ankle, but the strap is adjustable everywhere, because a single strap runs around your feet.
  We recommend this model for both men and women. I wear this model for years now every summer. It looks great on men’s feet and women’s feet also.
This model doesn’t have heels. If you’d like a similar one with heels, please visit

  Every sandal made by us according to the motto of our shop is created from the most attentively selected materials investing the best quality handwork into it.
  We hope you’ll enjoy as much as we enjoy creating and making them!

(This is only a guideline, all babies feet are different length...If you could, to make sure these little shoes fit... take a piece of paper, press baby's foot down, and make a mark from heel to biggest toe... then add 1/4 inch for a little room to grow, and order based on the size of your baby's foot. Please measure, do not guess... as i do not do refunds for incorrect sizes unless the item is faulty. Thank you!!!
***********************************************************
Please be aware: all products are handmade and have small buttons, beads, or ribbon/felt flowers that are sewn/ glued to the best of my ability, little babies love to grab their feet, so always be AWARE of your baby when they are wearing these shoes/ clothes/ accessories... Never leave them unattended while wearing Little Posh Bebe.

            Handmade to order, handsewn Native American Short Moccasins with Handcut Fringe, Plains Style with Leather Lace Tie
Traditional short moccasins, handmade by Lakota artist, Crowwolf. Each pair is custom made to order. Soles are made of sturdy buffalo hide, hold up great for daily wear and are ultra comfortable on the feet. Uppers are made of quality, natural color elk hide and handsewn with sinew. Fringe is handcut.
Moccasins are unisex and custom made to order (Size options are listed above, childrens sizes also available upon request). If possible, please send measurement of foot legnth and width as well. This helps Crowwolf custom fit moccasin as close as possible.
Moccasins are made traditionally to be worn without socks and fit the foot snug. Moccasins will stretch some once worn and will mold to your foot shape. If you would like to wear your moccasins with socks, please let us know so we may allow for the extra room.
Beading designs are available at an extra charge.
Various leather options also available. Pair pictured is made from buttery soft, natural/tan color elk hide.
*Please note, all of our items are handmade and one of a kind. The pictures of our moccasins and other custom made to order pieces are to show the workmanship and quality. Leather texture and finish varies from hide to hide. Leather color varies some from hide to hide, one gold elk hide may be a bit lighter or darker than another, for example. We use quality hides from animals humanely treated and DO NOT support factory farming of any animal. Each order is handmade, moccasins are handsewn one stitch at a time and no machine is involved in the creation process. Crowwolf honors the ancient traditions of the Lakota in his handcrafted leather designs.
Each design handcrafted by Crowwolf and/or Katy is cleansed within the sacred smoke with prayer.
