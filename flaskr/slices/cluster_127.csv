5364,"Stunning French antique still life painting, nature morte, signed Baumat, 1913.","
            Stunning French antique still life painting, nature morte, signed Baumat, 1913.
A very striking, well executed still life painting dating from 1913. It is signed on the bottom left for J Baumat and the year.
The painting has a real feel of autumn with the figs and grapes and the warm earthy colours. It is very atmospheric. I think it has some real charm and artistic merit.
In good condition considering its great age, there are signs of wear and age. The canvas is a little uneven in places and there are two tiny chips off the paint on the pear, visible on the right of photo 4.
On the back of the frame are some words stamped and an address in Paris where the canvas appears to have been purchased and stretched.
A wonderful French still life composition that would add some amazing antique style to your home.

6946,Lost Baby Sympathy Card - Miscarriage Card - Baby Bereavement Card,"
            A thoughtfully written sympathy card for those who have suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth.
Our unique bereavement card is intended to offer comfort to friends and family who have lost a baby. It could also be used as a reading at a funeral or memorial service.
It is hard to know what to say at such a difficult time. Poet Joanna Miller created this card after hearing that there were few suitable cards available which acknowledge the loss of a baby, whether through miscarriage or still birth.
The wording is the copyright of Bespoke Verse.
The card is square - the inside is blank for your message. The card is printed on FSC accredited 300gsm card. The quality is beautiful! The envelope is kraft (recycled brown). Card and envelope are presented in a cellophane sleeve and posted in a hard-backed envelope.
Card 148 x 148 mm Envelope 155 x 155 mm
Make this or any of our square cards a lovely gift by adding a card frame to your basket. See this page for further details:

8128,"Green Ivy leaf garland 2m with mini led fairy string lights rustic wedding decoration, woodland, enchanted forest","
            This is a beautiful Ivy leaf garland, made from artificial ivy leaves in two tones of green.  All along the garland is twisted a copper wire containing tiny mirco LEDs in a warm white colour, which make the garland appear to glow and twinkle.  In low light these look really magical.  Because of the copper wire, they can also be 'moulded' into position quite nicely.
Create that enchanted forest look at your wedding or in a bedroom.  Or use them as a stunning unique Christmas decoration.  They would be fantastic as part of a table centerpiece, just hide the battery pack, no need for plugs! Or they would be lovely hanging in a nursery, or draped over a mirror, or on a mantlepiece - they even come in really handy for subtle lighting when camping. The potential for this is limitless.
Because they are LEDs, they are very safe and don't get hot, and because they are battery operated, you can use them almost anywhere!
LED colour is warm white.  
Each garland is 2 metres long.  Requires 3 x AA batteries which are not included.
The lights will be sent via Royal Mail.  If you require tracked postage, please contact me for a price as this will be more expensive.
All my lights come gift wrapped in tissue paper.
Disclaimer:  As with all electrical items, these lights should not be left on unattended.        ",18.56,4.8405,"Handmade item

*****Please note due to high volume of orders the completion time is between 10-12 days for orders under 500 petals, larger orders 500 petals please allow 2-3 weeks.*****
I hand cut and singe each flower petal.  The petals will have an appearance of burnt singed edges, so please understand this is how they will look.  I singe some a little longer to give the wilting look as that is what real life petals look like.  
Various sizes range from 1"" (2.5400 cm) up to 3"" (7.6200 cm) in diameter.
Conversion from inches to cm:
1"" = 2.5400 cm
2"" = 5.0800 cm
3"" = 7.6200 cm
Prices/amount of petals:
Sample of petals =3
25 petals =7

Please message me if you are in need of a different color and I will do my best to match your color.  
For Special Orders: Please allow ample time for finding your special order fabric color and time for completion, some could take 15 days to complete your special order.
