13779,"Bachelorette Party Veil, Hen Party Veil, Bridal Shower Veil - White Tulle Veil with Bow","
            Perfect accessory for your favorite bride-to-be for her bachelorette party or bridal shower!
This party veil has six layers of soft bridal illusion tulle gathered and clean finished at the top with a ribbon.
The top is finished with a ribbon bow in your choice of colors.  All bows are made from grosgrain ribbon except the Gold Glitter, Iridescent, Pink Glitter and Silver Glitter which are made from a sparkly glitter ribbon.
Choose between a French barrette or a clear plastic hair comb.
Veil measures 18"" (45.5 cm) long.
Current make time is 3-5 business days plus shipping time. Standard shipping within the United States is USPS First Class and  generally takes 2-5 business days (but does not have a guaranteed delivery date and can take longer). Standard international shipping can take anywhere from 10 days to 4 weeks. There are faster shipping options available - you'll need to add the item to your cart and put in your zip or country to see all shipping options and prices.
***If you need the veil by a certain date, PLEASE add a note to your order with your need-by-date!***
Looking for a different color tulle or bow?  Click ""Request a custom order"" and let us know what you  need!
When you receive it, your veil will be a bit wrinkled from shipping. Hang it up to relax the fabric and then if necessary, steam with a fabric steamer or steam iron - hold iron 2” away from fabric - keeping heat away from the bow.  Or easier yet, hang it in the bathroom while running a hot shower.        ",17.00,4.9514,"Handmade item
