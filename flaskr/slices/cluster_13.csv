If you need your order expedited send us a note. 
About Bramble… 
Office employee by day. 
Leather Crafter by night. 
Daydreamer by necessity. 
All of our products are handmade in the United States (more specifically in my workshop). All of our leather is hand dyed and sourced from various locations; local and national. Your business supports a small American family and is sincerely appreciated. 
This listing is for ONE luggage tag (even if you see more than one pictured). 
If you want to purchase more that one tag choose the quantity you need during check out. 
THIS LISTING INCLUDES
Front :  And so the Adventure begins.  The font is Adventure. 
Please include the initials you want in the heart.. 
If you need to modify the quote for some reason please include your customization details in the notes to seller box.  If you choose a different font the layout might appear differently than what you see pictured above. 
Graphic design layout varies from by font.  
We can customize the back:
1. Back of the tag Font will always be in Times New Roman or 1940s typewriter. It is better to have a legible not too fancy font so it can be easily read ( when your bag is lost) . It will look like picture number two. Sometimes the text will be center justified. Depends on the length of the text.
Maybe include :    
If lost please return too : 
Name
phone number 
email
The Back of the tag is less smooth and looks semi unfinished but that is just the texture of the leather. The dye on the back a bit lighter so the text is more visible ( so the tag can actually be functional). 
Please include any information you want on the back of the tag during check out. 
We will not confirm your information. We will just cut, paste, and then engrave ( so please double check). 
Luggage Tag Specs.
1. All our tags are made by hand ( in my workshop). We are located in the United States. 
2. Both sides can be personalized. The back of the tag is not as smooth and a bit more rustic looking. Please look at picture number two and make sure that you like the look because it cant be changed.  
3. Hardware is provided 
4.  Measures 3.5 "" long x 2 "" wide. 
5.  Color is saddle brown but may vary slightly from picture. All of our tags are hand dyed so please allow for variation.
Luggage tag passport sets are below… If you buy a luggage tag with a passport the price is less. 
 
IMPORTANT BRAMBE FACTS
1. We can engrave any quote that you want. There are no character or word limits. 
2. We do not STAMP or Letterpress our customizations. Our personalizations are burned into the leather. This means that your quote will not disappear or wear down.
3. We can also do any font size but we have a set formula that we tend to use as a guide. Sometimes the size font that you may like might not translate well.. Meaning the font could look quite large on your computer screen but will actually look small on the surface of the leather. 
4. Double check the information you give us for your personalization. We will simply cut and paste your note. If it is incorrect or misspelled that will be what you see on your passport. So please take a couple of minutes and read your quote out loud ( to yourself) to make sure there are no mistakes.
5. Sometimes the leather may have a nick or a slight dye imperfection. This is because we hand make all of our items. It is not considered a flaw. We just don't produce assembly line things. We process all of our leather and try to use every possible part. 
We are starting to list full hides. So if you are looking for something hide oriented send us a note.

261,Mid Century Suitcase Set // Vintage Avocado Green Retro Mod Luggage Set of Three Hard Shell Suitcases with Gold Interiors Storage Travel,"
            In a retro avocado green, this is a vintage set of three mid-century suitcases. Each has a green plastic/rubber handle with silver latches and a gold vinyl interior. The smallest case has a mirror inset in the lid. No keys are included. Theses cases nest neatly inside one another for easy storage.
CONDITION: Pretty good vintage condition, still ready to be put to use. The largest case shows the most wear. The edging is a bit bent at the front left corner, making it difficult to close. The case has a fair amount of scuffs and light stains on the exterior with some chew marks along one of the edges (see closeup). The latches and hinges have some light rusty tarnish. The other cases have some light exterior wear -- a few small stains and some little scuffed patches. The interiors are all in pretty good shape with a yellowed stain and small tear inside the large case (see closeup) and a slightly detached section inside the medium case.
MEASUREMENTS:
Large - 23 inches long by 15 1/2 inches wide and 7 1/2 inches deep
Medium - 20 1/2 inches long by 14 inches wide and 6 1/2 inches deep
Small - 16 1/2 inches long by 12 inches wide and 6 inches deep
SHIPPING is the best estimated price through USPS. Depending on your location, FedEx may provide a better rate. If this is the case, I will switch and issue you a refund. Any overage of 2 or more will be refunded on the day of shipment.

1208,SALE Van Eyck Emerald RIng: 18K Yellow Gold Emerald And Diamond,"
            The true embodiment of Jan Van Eyck's famous painting, the Arnolfini Portrait. This natural emerald cloaks itself in the richest enigmatic green-iconic to not only fine emeralds, but revered by painters. The emerald is quite fittingly cut in an emerald-cut, and is lovingly cradled by minimal yet tasteful 18K yellow gold prongs, and dusted with a sprinkling of small accent diamonds. 
Ring is a size 7. Marked ""750"" (European hallmarks for 18K gold) Can be re-sized. The emerald measures 9.85x6.98x4.3mm. We guestimate that the weight of the emerald is between 1.75-2.00ct (we have not removed the emerald from the setting so this is an approximation.)
*As this is a vintage piece, we are unsure of the emerald's origin. 
*The Arnolfini portrait is not included

1526,"Mid Century Home-made Camping Kitchen - Camping Chest - Portable Table ""Lots of Character""","
            WOODEN CAMP KITCHEN - TRUNK - CHUCK BOX
We acquired this unique, home-made camp kitchen from a women who owned it told us her husband built it in the early 1960s. She said it was used extensively by their family on their camping adventures for many, many years. This cleverly designed cabinet measures 23.5"" X 15"" X 23"" tall and the sides fold up to make a 48"" X 23.5"" table/work surface. It is constructed out of 1/2"" plywood with aluminum edge guards on top and table top edges. The table leafs are held in place by two wooden dowels. Inside there are five compartments (shelves) in the main compartment and there is a 5"" tall compartment underneath with flaps on each side--perfect for storing camp stove and fuel (the table dowels are also stored in the bottom hatch). All the flaps and sides are secured for transport with flip latches and there are thick rope handles on each end for carrying (weighs approx. 30 lbs.) The exterior has distressed red paint while the interior shelving has its original clear varnish. The rope handles are glued and stapled to the interior walls (you can see in last photo). This old piece has still has some life left in it for the vintage camper but would also make for a unique side table, bar, porch table, etc. NOTE- the chairs and/or props in the main photo are not included.
CONDITION:
This piece is structurally sound but has some distressing from over fifty years of service and storage. The red exterior paint is chippy and worn revealing some white paint and wood underneath. The plywood has some chips and fatigue mainly along the bottom edges. The metal latches has rust and pitting but still operate. The piano hinges on the table top leafs and bottom hatches have some rust and pitting as well but all still operate. The interior vanish is fairly clean but the original varnish is worn and there as some stains and a few remnants of paper in spots.

It will probably ship via FedEx Ground so please provide a physical shipping address if different than your mailing address (no PO Boxes).

4225,Rare Vintage Lucite Purse With Rhinestones By Patricia Of Miami,"
            Rare Vintage Lucite Purse With Rhinestones Made in the 50's By Patricia Of Miami. 
In the late 1940s, various New York handbag companies released lines of Lucite purses. 
By 1950, Miami Beach had become the happening spot for wealthy American vacationers; its fun-in-the-sun, holiday appeal made it the perfect spot to sell Lucite purses. Many Florida-based manufacturers sprung up in the early ‘50s one of them was, Patricia of Miami.
This purse has a very unique design. The color is a mix of beige black and dark green. 
The lucite is in excellent condition. However , this purse has lost some of its rhinestones over the years. 
Please make sure to look at the pictures for further details.

4648,Vintage Bolo Tie with Crystal Cabochon **FREE SHIPPING**,"
            Vintage bolo tie made by an artisan in the 1960's in Memphis, TN.  
The bolo tie measures about 38"" long and is made of textured black leather with silver tips.
The crystal cabochon is green with black veins and it's variety is a bit of a mystery.  I have visited with other crystal experts and we are fairly sure it is one of the following:
 - Green Aventurite (most likely)
 - Malachite 
 - Seraphinite
Although its true origin and variety are a mystery, it is a beautiful stone that looks to be hand polished.  It measures about 1.75"" circle.  The total measurement with the setting is about a 2"" circle.        ",39.00,,"Vintage item from the 1960s

This gorgeous eerie doll is  Elizabeth
. Her Spirit is 27 years old. For those of you who follow me or have purchased from me than you know about Lindy, She like Lindy was in an abusive relationship but hers started from when she was a baby. Her mother was a drug addict and would not feed her, or take care of her. She was taken away by the state and in and out of foster cares for most of her life. She met a man by the name of Michael , he was a knight and shining armor at first. He treated like she had never been treated in a good way. She was the happiest woman. As soon as they were to start planning their wedding on the beach in California he started to become very controlling and abusive. He got into cocaine, and it made him very violent. She held on to the man she met and could not leave him, praying everyday the man she fell in love with would be that man again. They went to the Beach to talk and find the area they were to be wed at , and he ended up taking her life right then and there. She is a free white light Spirit. She has finally been freed of the bad tormented life she was handed to at birth. Elizabeth had only two years of happiness when Michael was her knight and shining armor. Her Spirit is one of the strongest I have come across. She is a fighter, a protector, and a loyal Spirit. 
 She does not want to hurt or harm you. She wants to fulfill what she could not in her life. She does require love and attention. She is powerful Spirit. She would love to have other Spirit Children around her. I have had her evp tested and she did measure very high activity. I have had her for some time. I must let her tend to another family. I have an over abundance of them myself. I had her in my room, and I had a vision and she was holding a card with hearts on it. I then felt a warm hand grab my hand. And I heard clear as day "" Please find me a family, there is someone special who is thinking about me. "" I must abide by her request. I have felt her energy I have seen her little shadows on the wall. I have heard a little sweet voice from her when I have separated her from the others. Sometimes I Have to separate the dolls from the others so I can hear only them. 
If her heart is calling to you do not pass her up. The doll itself is a made of Porcelain , she has green eyes they turn blue sometimes. She has gorgeous gold curly locks, a mauroon velvet and white faux fur  dress, stockings, with adorable boots. She is dressed to impress and ready for her new home.    Below is more information regarding my collection.
She  Belonged to an older lady named Wichita Sophia, Sophia was a real Wicca  she was part of our paranormal group she had a very strong connection with me, and it is said that I was her favorite as we shared the same passion
She had never married and never had children, She has no family that we even know of
I have so much respect for Wichita  Sophia, as she was so powerful it was amazing,
I was devastated she passed away, Sophia had  a large doll collection,, She practiced Witchaca and was very good at it,She was very much into meditating and practiced many rituals and senescences .  Wichita Sophia passed away from and unexpected death, she left behind many treasures, her most favorite her dolls, I am proud that I have been given the estate over her dolls
I had a deep discussion with her a couple of weeks and she was just fine, she asked me to promise that if something were to happen (as if she  Knew) to sell her dolls, for her she told me specifically that they all have a purpose I have found little notes left by the dolls with their names and they are from a spririted collection.
She told me that it would be her greatest gift to all and it was to be followed
as I have been going through the dolls I have noticed pieces of jewelry oils, rocks  or pins, these either belonged to Sophia or the Spirits, It is quit intriguing
This doll is not a toy and is not recommended for children to play with. 
State law requires me to let the customer know when purchasing magikal items I will not be held responsible for what may occur.

Good condition.  
These Goebel collectibles have been lovingly cared for by my mother and grandmother who began collecting them in the late 1940's.
My uncle, stationed in Germany as part of the U.S. occupational forces at the close of WWII, discovered the lovely porcelain figurines created by the W. Goebel company based on the drawings of M.I. Hummel.
Knowing his sister and mother loved dolls, he mailed some back to them as gifts and ,thus began their life-long love affair with Hummels.
They continued to add to and enlarge their collection throughout the rest of their lives.

The name on the box is ""Marque De Fabrique"" and plays eight (8) different songs from the period, and the original handwritten list (Calligraphy) is posted on the inside cover (see photo). Facing the box, the outside dimensions are 19""W X 9.25""D X 6.50""H.
The comb-plate has sixty combs and all are in excellent condition. The cylinder is 9"" in length and has a diameter of 2.5"" and all of the thousands of pins are in excellent shape. The tone is great!
I have owned this Music Box for fifty-five (55) years. I see this same vintage Music Box advertised on the Internet for 8-10K in this condition. All of the serial number imprints are identical (# 52145). The original hand crank is included.
I will ship the Music Box for free just to insure it is packed properly and gets there with no damage. It can also be insured for the shipping. You will love to own this Music Box.  I am selling it because I am getting too old and I have no heirs left.

This awesome unique art is an awesome hand painted rock that would be a fabulous statement gift for husband. This spectacular one of a kind three dimensional art is the perfect gift for someone who has everything.  
This is Ishi Stone #13, of the Streamers series. It has the natural stone background, forming some of the ""streamers"", with the remainder of the streamers colored dark blue, turquoise, brown, and charcoal. There is a satin finish, blue band. The Stone is signed, numbered, and dated by me, artist Delores Malcomson. I sign my work ""DMIshi"" (DM are my initials, and the word"" Ishi"" means rock or stone, in Japanese), with the copyright symbol, the date, and the code for the name of the design, in this case ""ST"" for Streamers, and 13 for the number of the stone. The medium is acrylic paint, and satin acrylic varnish to seal the stone. This Ishi is, approximately, 3"" wide x 5 & 1/2"" long x 4"" at its' highest. It is self standing. The stone can be rotated in different directions to present a variety of faces, as your mood dictates. The photographs show the front side and the back side, of the stone, in the different positions that you can display it. This is OOAK, One-of-a-Kind, you will own the only one.
UNFAMILIAR WITH ISHI STONES? READ THE DESCRIPTION, BELOW:
Ishi Stones are common river and beach stones that have been transformed into works of fine art, by me, artist Delores Malcomson. Each Ishi Stone is signed, numbered, and dated by me. I work my designs all around the stones, enveloping them, incorporatating the stone and design together into multifaceted, 3 dimensional artworks. The whole of the design is not seen immediately, but is discovered as the stone is turned and viewed from different angles. The Stone can be rotated in different directions to present a variety of faces, as your mood dictates. The photographs show the front side and the back side, of the Stone, in the different positions that you can display it.
I have taken the art of painting on stone to a new level, with my original designs and color finishes. In the spirit of traditional Japanese art, Impressed by the fact that simplicity and essence of nature, combined with the elaborate are always reflected in Japanese art, the name of ""Ishi"" (which translates stone or rock, in Japanese) was chosen to represent my work. The challenge of taking an object, that is generally considered to be of little interest or value, and turning it into a work of art is what inspires me to bring life and beauty to an otherwise ignored element of nature.

6219,Extremely Rare- 4 Vintage One Of A Kind Dog Booties worn in the Famous Alaska Iditarod Race,"
            Vintage Dog Booties worn in the Iditarod Race!   Great Christmas gifts!  Very limited quantity.
These dog booties were worn by actual Iditarod Dogs racing to Nome, AK between 1990-2000
ONE OF A KIND ! Special friends of mine were part of the Follow Up Team.  They were responsible for making sure of the position of each team at night so no Team was left behind.  Their job was very important making sure that all the mushers and their teams were safe.  After 25 years my friends retired, therefore, the supply of booties has stopped.
You won't find these authentic Iditarod Dog Booties anywhere else!  Because of the rarity of these booties when they are sold out, unfortunately there won't be any more. 
Make your dog an Iditarod Dog!!
About the Iditarod:
The Iditarod is 1049 miles of the roughest, most beautiful terrain Mother Nature has to offer. She throws jagged mountain ranges, frozen river, dense forest, desolate tundra and miles of windswept coast at the mushers and their dog teams. Add to that temperatures far below zero, winds & hazards of overflow, long hours of darkness and treacherous climbs and side hills, and you have the Iditarod. A race extraordinaire, a race to save lives!
From Anchorage, in south central Alaska, to Nome on the western Bering Sea coast.
It’s not just a sled dog race, it’s a race in which unique men and woman compete. Mushers enter from all walks of life. Fishermen, lawyers, doctors, miners, artists, natives, Canadians, Swiss, French and others.  Men and women each with their own story, each with their own reasons for going the distance. Hundreds  of volunteers, men and women, students and village residents all help to organize and stage the event. They man headquarters at Wasilla, Anchorage, and Nome.  They fly volunteers, veterinarians, dog food and supplies. They act as checkers, coordinators, and family supporters of each musher.        ",50.00,,"Vintage item

6234,All Natural Fur Baby Paw Protector Wax,"
            Does your fur baby hate having booties on to protect their little (or large) paws? Do they look humiliated as soon as you get them all on? 
Well BRANCH: A New Beginning has just the thing for your fur child. We have an all natural wax that has all natural ingredients like beeswax, avocado oil, coconut and a natural oil so as not to harm your baby. There is no scent to this wax to distract your fur baby. This all natural wax just gets lightly rubbed on the pads of the paw before putting your pet outside. Keep your pets paws unclogged from mud, snow, ice and other outside elements while keeping their pads moisturized.
This product is just being rolled out and would love to hear your feedback. This is used on my German Shepherd puppy (5 months old) and keeps her pads from getting all clumpy. 
The size we are providing is a .5 ounce package. It is 1"" deep and an 1 ½"" in diameter for easy handling. We will be working on larger sizes later, but this is easily rubbed on for larger pets.
These are made to order. Orders received during the week, will be produced over the weekend and shipped out on Monday at the latest. You will receive a delivery confirmation with shipping details. Any questions, please ask before ordering.
All funds raised from this item will go to helping with the costs to send our organization's dog to school so she can learn how to work with victims of human trafficking.        ",2.50,,"Handmade item

6285,"BEST SELLING! Tiki Rope perches / parrot swings - 4' length x 1.5"" diameter. Outstanding toys for cockatoos, African Greys, Amazons, conures","
            Natural Manila Rope   
Non-toxic / Not treated      
304 Stainless steel Hardware
Indoor / Outdoor 
Long Lasting
Great for Pluckers
High Quality
Our parrot ropes are natural non-toxic manila and have stainless steel hardware to eliminate the danger of heavy metal toxicity and rusting.  They can be used indoors in cages or outdoors in aviaries, between play gyms, from the ceiling as a play area, or hung vertically or diagonal for enriching environmental variety!  The ropes are very durable, lasting well with daily use from large macaws and cockatoos and are used in zoos and aviaries across the country.  The manila is a brittle fiber rope, similar to sisal but with a much softer more natural texture, so toe nails do not get tangled in the fibers like cotton.  It needs very little trimming, if any, over the life of the rope.  This makes them a favorite for use in breeder cages and aviaries as the birds can enjoy rope perches without the need for constant intrusion from their caretakers.  They are also excellent for birds with plucking issues as they love to preen the fibers of the rope.  This holds true for the smaller birds as well - including cockatiels, budgies, poicephalus, psittacula (asiatic parakeets), african greys, amazons, conures, and australian grass parakeets.  We have received an amazing amount of feedback from our eclectus and cockatiel owners telling us how much their birds love picking at the fibers of these ropes!  For our African Greys, we recommend the larger 2"" diameter as they seem to enjoy the stability of the perch to the smaller, less rigid 1.5"" ropes.  And, of course, these are customer favorites for those who share their lives with the large macaws and cockatoos.  Read our Customer Reviews for more feedback about these best sellers.
Please allow for slight variations to the length of the rope as we hand make each one.  Clean with warm water and grape seed extract; dry in the sun. 
The Tiki Ropes comes in Two diameters - 1.5"" and 2""
The 1 1/2 inch rope is appropriate for all birds from budgies to large macaws and cockatoos.  To maintain healthy feet and add enrichment, it is beneficial to offer a variety of perch sizes in your parrot's cage and environment.  Observations of wild birds including parakeets, lories, pionus, conures, cockatoos, and macaws show that they comfortably perch on a wide variety of diameters and surfaces from very thick, fat, tree branches where their feet sit almost flat to teeny, tiny, twigs that can barely hold their weight.  So don't be afraid to 'branch out' from the ""recommended"" perch sizes!  However, from extensive observations of our own parrots on their ropes for the past decade, we can tell you that they like ""the big ones!""  It appears that they enjoy an ""oversize"" rope to one that is similar in size to their usual perches.  This holds true for the little birds as well.  The cockatiels prefer their big 1 1/2 inch rope to their 1/2"" rope, two feathers down!     The medium sized birds can go either way - 1 1/2 inch or 2 inch.  This includes amazons, african Greys, eclectus, small cockatoos, and mini macaws.  However, when given the choice, many African Greys choose the 2 inch rope, as it is more stable and supportive.  My goffins cockatoo, Halo, also prefers the larger 2"" rope over the 1.5"" size.  Our definite recommendations for the large macaws and cockatoos are the 2 inch rope.  These big birds LOVE big ropes.  If you have a Moluccan or Umbrella, get ready for some serious flapping fun!

6317,"Cat Toy Ball, Single Marbled Alpaca Wool Hand Felted Jingle Ball Cat Toys, Pet Gift with a Pinch of Catnip, Unique Handmade Pet Toy","
            It's love at first jingle! Your cats will get excited at the sound of these hand felted alpaca wool cat toys! It's also quite funny to watch them chase the toys across a room. 
This listing is for a single Marbled Felt Cat Toy. 
Each ball is handmade from natural alpaca wool (directly from a local Ontario farm) and contains a pinch of catnip. They have a hard plastic core which contains a small jingle bell and layers and layers of soft wool. 
Each toy has a really nice marble effect and colour varies by ball. You will receive a toy ball, hand selected by me. If you see a colour in the photos above that you really love or prefer not to receive, make sure you let me know at the time of purchase.
The balls are about the size of a ping pong ball, but can vary slightly in size since they are handmade. The toys are quite bouncy and are great for throwing around and playing fetch, or just for swatting around the room and eventually losing under the couch.
CUSTOMER FEEDBACK:
""My cat loves them! She plays with them every evening."" - Karen
""Our cat loves his toy and has suddenly started playing fetch, which is so weird."" -Steve
""My cats loved these balls the minute I opened the pkg. Thanks for the fast shipping and communication. They really are nice little toys."" - Roberta

6377,1 POUND of Deer and Elk Antler Dog Chew Toys- Pick your Size,"
            Cut from Real, Natural Deer  and Elk antlers.  These natural toys are great for dogs of all sizes, and especially loved by very heavy chewers. Also a great training aid for teaching your dog to find shed antlers!
This lot is ONE full pound of our Antler Dog Chews in your choice of the sizes listed below. 
All of our chews have the sharp points removed and are cut from good solid antler . Never cut from old, crumbling antler like those commercial chews sold in pet stores!  The larger the chew the larger the overall diameter,  minimum average diameter is 1/2"".  Larger chews up to 1-1/2"".  The number of pieces per pound varies with diameter and piece size.  Each mix is different.  We do not sand the edges on this particular lot of chews.  If you want your edges sanded, please contact us  and we will set up a listing just for you. 
Available Sizes:  Please select your choice from the drop down menu. 
1. Assorted Branched Pieces- Mixed Medium/Large pieces with forks, branches and other odd shapes
2. Assorted Straight Cut Pieces- Mixed Small to Large Pieces with no branches or forks
3. Small Only-  4 to 5.5 inches long on average - For Toy and Small dogs under 20 pounds (6-10 pieces per pound on average)
4. Medium Only- 5.5 to 7.5 inches long - For Medium dogs 20-50 pounds (2-5 pieces per pound on average)
5. Large Only- 7.5 to 9.5 inches long - For Large dogs 50-75 pounds (2-4 pieces per pound on average)
6. XL Only- 9.5 to 12 inches long - For all other Large breed dogs over 75 pounds (1-2 pieces per pound on average)
ALWAYS supervise your pet while chewing any toy!  Take the toy away when it becomes less than 1"" wider than the width of your dogs mouth as any small toy can be a choking hazard. 
Shipping:
First pound ships for 13.95.  Each additional pound ships for just 50 CENTS!
Custom requests for sizes, shapes and colors are always welcome!
Thanks for looking,

6750,Bulbasaur Planter - Aurora Blue - Pokemon,"
            ***Update (2/22): The old size is now listed as Small, and the new size will be Medium. The small Bulbasaur has a potting space of about 1.6"" diameter and .9"" depth which makes it only suitable for very small succulents or seedlings. The medium Bulbasaur has a potting space of about 1.9"" diameter and 1.1"" depth which is a lot more than it sounds (I'll post a picture soon). Processing time is 3 days.***
Introducing the Aurora Blue Bulbasaur. We came up with a new 3D printing technique which combines colors in a way that's never been done before. We call the technique ""Jelly Donut"" and this Bulbasaur is the result.
""Jelly Donut"" - A New Way for Printing Two Colors
We wanted to use Bulbasaur's original colors, but mix them in a way that only 3D printing can. We carefully printed the outer shell in green and the inner structure in blue. Both colors are translucent allowing them to blend naturally as light passes through. Shining brilliantly when viewed at various angles, the luster surface is a nod to the holographic rare cards. With its soft blend of blue green hues and reflected highlights, this Bulbasaur is our tribute to a beloved Pokemon.
Based on our market research surveys, we determined this size, 2.8"" length by 2.6"" width by 2.4"" height, to be the optimal balance of practicality and cuteness factor.
This technique maintains complete functionality like all other Bulbasaur planters: simply place a small succulent on his back.

            We make our premium fish tanks out of premium USA-Sourced Cell-cast Acrylic Material. This results in an edge-less design where the entire tank is perfectly clear. This material is scratch resistant and offers better optical clarity and lowers optical distortion than glass. 
Our tanks are diamond cut and the edges are polished to a mirror finish. They are structurally secure and the sides will not bow due to water pressure.
This tank is 40"" Long, 12"" Deep, and 12"" Tall; 1/2"" Thick. It is 5-sided with an open top. A sump or other structures can be added as required. It is approx. 24 Gallons in volume.
Acrylic Fish Tanks are 17x stronger, softer and more flexible than glass as well as far more impact resistant. Unlike glass, acrylic adds no color tint.
We are able to make tanks in any size/dimensions you may require, so be sure to ask us if you need a custom size!

7310,Blanket MILA crocheted,"
            Twenty crocheted squares have teamed up to this little blanket and looking forward to be cuddled. Donnegal Tweed from Ireland, virgin wool and cotton make this little piece of textile art to a rustic, yet warm and soft home accessory. Additionally applied motifs as the seagull or the sign ""Om mani pat me hum"" illustrate the loving hand that was applied in this case. The wool was not only finished by hand, but partly colored by hand, and that's not the main reason for which our cat and dog friends love them: the dimensions of approximately 42 x 52cm offer themselves as a sleeping place with ideal dimensions - this ceiling must simply be besieged. But also babys are happy to cuddle in this warm and handy blanket!
Either way, the blanket MILA is a real eye-catcher and fits in its rustic style ideal in any contemporary household that wants to come a little closer to the country style.

7335,Minimalist modern cat bed - Seafoam Blue,"
            This modern, minimalist cat bed was handmade in my Sydney studio. The bed is made all in one piece using a crochet stitch that produces a warm, flexible fabric that your kitty will love to cuddle against. 
The sides are floppy with a curved in rolled top edge. The stitch has a lovely texture on the outside, whilst the inside has a smoother feel against kitty's paws.
This bed is a seafoam or duck egg blue colour.
This is not a big bed. It is just the right size to hug a typical adult cat when they are curled up. 
Upon ordering, you will receive a brand new bed that hasn't been sat in by any cat.
Size: 38 cm / 15 inches diameter. The handsome cat model in the photos is an adult male who weighs 5 kg / 11 lb. If your cat is significantly larger then they might not fit. Please check before ordering.
Materials: 100% acrylic yarn
Weight: 300g / 10 oz

—— Bearing - Si3N4 SILICON NITRIDE CERAMIC BEARING - Silicon nitrided ceramic is one of the most hardest materials in the world. Though its price is the highest among all the bearings, but it’s the most suitable choice for the hand spinner bearing.

            *Improved accuracy*
These Bowtruckle companions are hand made and take a few days to finish so please allow up to 4/5 days before shipping. 
The best thing about these items is that they are slightly flexible! They will not break if dropped but I do not reccomend moving the limbs too much. Great for costumes or even just sitting on the shelf.
Each will be unique and made with a personal touch, but they will have a resemblance to Pickett the hero Bowtruckle from fantastic beasts.

9766,CUSTOM CHESS BOARDS,"
            We can create a custom chess board to your specifications.  You can choose from the following wood:  maple, walnut, cherry, mahogany, and hickory.  If you require a different type of wood, we will try to order that type of wood, but if it is more expensive, we will have pass on the cost to you in the price of the board.  PLEASE DO NOT JUST CLICK ""ADD TO CART""...WE HAVE TO GET THE DIMENSIONS AND MATERIALS FOR YOUR ORDER AND THEN WE WILL CREATE A CUSTOM LISTING JUST FOR YOU.
The first photo shows a maple and walnut board, the second one is maple and mahogany, the third one is maple and walnut (the picture does not show the correct color--it was more like the first picture); the fourth one is maple and cherry, and the last one is maple and walnut again.  The types of wood, dimensions, and finish can be adjusted to fit your needs.
Custom boards require a couple of weeks to be made and ground UPS shipping takes about a week, so allow for a few weeks for delivery of finished product. PLEASE DO NOT JUST CLICK ""ADD TO CART""...WE HAVE TO GET THE DIMENSIONS AND MATERIALS FOR YOUR ORDER AND THEN WE WILL CREATE A CUSTOM LISTING JUST FOR YOU.
OPTIONS: The third photo shows a custom board created for a customer with a wider border and raised lip around the edge since she was using it for a coffee table. The dimensions were 26"" x26"".  The cost of the shipping was more than the smaller ones we make because of added weight and packaging requirements, so if the board you order is a larger dimension, it may require extra shipping charges as well. The last photo shows an option of a two tone border that would cost 50 more, so the total cost of the board would be 250 (not including the shipping). It also shows an option of laser engraving, which would add another 30 to the cost.  You will need to specify in your message if you would like either of these options.  
NOTE:  The second photo is a board we currently have in stock and you can find that listing in our shop (however, the prices for our in-stock boards are only 150 instead of the custom board price of 200.).  
SHIPPING INFO:  Since this is a custom order, I have the shipping (for USA only) set to a pretty high amount of 70 and have estimated the dimensions for a typical board.  I do not want you to be surprised at shipping...usually it runs about 50 unless it is unusually large like the one in the 3rd photo.  I just want to cover myself on this.  I will NOT overcharge you for the shipping.  I do not charge a handling fee.  I only charge you what it costs me to ship it by UPS with guaranteed arrival with no damage.  Once I know the dimensions of your order, I will do a final shipping charge on your custom listing that will be accurate for your board's weight/dimensions and the location it is being shipped to.   
IMPORTANT!!!  For any board ordered, we have to know the dimensions and type of wood you want us to use.  Once we have that information, we will create a custom listing just for you. PLEASE DO NOT JUST CLICK ""BUY"".  THIS IS FOR A CUSTOM ORDER AND I WILL CREATE A CUSTOM LISTING ONCE YOU LET ME KNOW WHAT MATERIALS AND DIMENSIONS YOU WANT.        ",200.00,,"Handmade item

10107,Marble Puzzle - Walnut and Plexiglass,"
            Here's a little gem. The original designer must have been a woodworking physics teacher. You get to figure it out. The idea is to get the two marbles into their corresponding holes in the block at the same time. Simple.
Single American black walnut block with hardwood dowel, plexiglass sides and top. Brass nails.
6-1/4"" long x 1-3/16"" wide x 2"" tall
1/8"" thick plexiglass sides and top with brass nails
2 Pale Blue Cat's Eye ""Shooter"" Marbles
Hardwood dowel

            Just A Gleam Of Heaven In Her Eyes - Chas. K. Harris - 1904 -  Framed Sheet Music Cover
This is the cover from sheet music  - dated November 30, 1904
Just A Gleam Of Heaven In Her Eyes
""Published by Chas. K. Harris - New York/Chicago
Canadian American Music Co. Ltd, Toronto, Canada
Australia Office - Sydney""
Charles K. Harris lived 1835 to 1933.
-----------------------------------------------
I found this cover in an obscure little antique store in rural Wisconsin in the mid- 1990's and I framed it in oak with non-glare glass.  At the time my 8 year old daughter wanted to decorate her new bedroom with antiques - I think she was born with a decorator's eye -  and she loved the color purple!  Great find!
It is in very good condition for it's age, there are a few creases, folds and a few age spots on the paper, but those add to it's character and charm.  :-)
Size:  12.5 x 15.5    
The oak frame is not vintage.  
There is a hook on the back to hang.

Inspired by mid-century design, your hook will have its own unique pattern.  No two are exactly alike.  The unique stripes are made from wood shop cuts that would otherwise be wasted.
Comes with mounting hardware.

WHO, WHAT & WHY....
I’m JJ Miller, a website designer (and blogger at love-ondon.co.uk) who is  passionate about helping people shine online. 
Throughout my 9 years designing beautiful WordPress websites for clients of all sizes, I’ve come up against one major obstacle. Some people just don’t have the time, or budget, for a bespoke website design. However, they still want to have a web presence that not only looks professional – but looks GREAT too.
SO, I CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION.
A range of pre-designed, easily customisable website designs, that come with free hosting, fully installed onto a domain of your choice. Thanks to our easy to follow, foolproof user-guide, you can change the images and pictures to your own, swapping fonts and colours to suit your brands personality…for a unbelievably low price.

This Overbust Corset is ideal for a wedding, or just changing the colors, a unique, luxury and elegant corset for any especial occasion. It is made with satind, lining with organza, and flowers of lace brocade, fixed one by one in the corset.  It has a heartshaped bustline. It has a cut over the hip, which accentuates even more the female curves in the well known nineteenth-century-figure named after ""hourglass"". 
It is made with four layers of fabric, fully armed with steel spiral bones. The front and back of the corset have flat bones, which will reduce and constraint even more. The bones are coated with gross grain to give more durability and make it comfortable. It has also a waist reduction tape inside and a steel boned Modesty Panel or back panel. And, of course, satin interlining.
For any other modification, (for example, if you want it without busk) other colour or materials that are not listed in the tabs, do not hesitate to contact and ask us.
All our corsets are of the highest quality and are made one by one just for you. They have steel spiral bones, a boned back panel and reductive belt around the waist. We use materials, patterns and techniques of the highest category, so you get a perfect figure guaranteed by and with your corset.

Believe me when I say you have never seen anything as cool and beautiful as this stunning 60s trouser suit! As soon as I found this soft metallic gold beauty, in a freezing cold warehouse, I knew that it was an amazing find! Only when I realised that it was a beautiful original 1960s trouser suit did I fully comprehend how cool it really was. How amazing it would look worn as either an alternative to a vintage (of course) wedding dress or to change into to dance your wedding night away. Everything about this pant suit is perfect; from the dramatic bell sleeves, longer length silhouette on the top and the beautiful white crochet detailing around the neckline and arms really makes it extra special. The matching high waist trousers are flattering to wear and have this season must have kick flare design. The top has the original metal zip fastening still in it to the back and the trousers also have a zip fastening, this has been replaced. This vintage 60s boho co-ord is just so pretty and with wedding suits for women being a huge trend for this season you have no excuse not to wear this vintage beauty and show off just how really cool you are.

            ********** Vintage Evening Dresses **********
In the Edwardian era, women's day dresses and evening gowns had an S-curve silhouette. During the 1920s, the hems rose and decorations became more showy. This would lead to more conservative dresses during the Great Depression. After the end of World War II, in 1947, Christian Dior introduced his ""New Look"" of nipped-in waistlines and full skirts. Luxurious fabrics were used for these dresses, and the ball gown was re-introduced. The ball gown often has a strapless bodice, although short and long sleeves are common as long as the cut is off-the-shoulder. Ball gowns remain the most formal female attire to this day, and are worn exclusively to balls.
Florence Lace carefully selects and sources vintage evening gowns for ladies who want to create the above and for those who love feminine, elegant and delicately made dresses. Some of our dresses are vintage and have been previously owned so may have minor indications of their former life. These will be described as accurately as is possible, will be photographed and will be made available upon request. The photographs are an important part of the description and indicate the item you will receive, so please look at the photographs and read the description carefully. 
We also have a range of brand new vintage styled elegant dresses. Please view the following link : https://www.freewebstore.org/florence-lace

            As a bridalwear designer I realised there was a gap in the market for a waterproof cloak for brides which not only protects from falling rain but also holds the wedding dress and all its skirts from puddles and mud, allowing the bride to walk unaided and hands free.
Rainaway Bride was born!!!
This innovative item will ensure all brides arrive to their wedding day with their wedding dress and veil clean and dry whatever the weather.

13825,Dragon Corset,"
            Hand dyed silk with organza 'scales' and hand dyed silk lining. This can be made available in a choice of colours as the silk is custom dyed. Wide steel busk front opening with black metal hook closure. Modesty panel and satin ribbon laced eyelets at the back. 
Matching fabric based accessories can be made available at an additional time and cost.  
Matching skirts and bridal wear can also be made available at an additional time and cost. 
All my couture corsets contain an internal waist stay which reinforces the area for gentle waist reduction of 2"" - 4"", depending on how 'squishy' you are, and are constructed from the finest spiral and sprung steel boning and English cotton coutil to support, smooth, define and enhance your figure into an hourglass shape. It is only the waist area that should be cinched, the bust should not be squeezed or flattened.
All my front opening corsets have finest quality wide steel busks to further smooth the silhouette. Choose from traditional hooks and eyes or dramatic swing hooks, available in a choice of colours. If the corset has a closed front this area is re-enforced with multiple sprung steels to act in the same smoothing way.
Full length eyelet lacing to the back ensures that the waist can be comfortably pulled in. Eyelets are also available in a choice of colours. I have also learned as the years have passed that a modesty panel is a must to avoid the view of squeezed flesh behind the laces. This ensures that you look beautiful from the back as well as the front. I prefer to use high quality double sided satin ribbon for lacing for a luxurious, glamorous finish to the back of the corset. It will also preserve your hands when tightening!

15729,Milk Kefir Grains (2 heaping Tbsp),"
            Kefir is a fermented drink. It has a consistency that is between milk and yogurt. These kefir grains can be used in almost any type of milk (we put ours in whole milk). One heaping tablespoon of kefir grains in a quart jar of milk makes set kefir in 24-48 hours. Kefir has many strains of good bacteria and probiotics that colonize your digestive tract. Kefir also contains a more digestible form of calcium than milk. The kefir grains eat the lactose out of the milk, so kefir is virtually lactose free. 
To ship we double bag 2 heaping tablespoons of milk kefir grains with a little milk (so the grains don't starve in transit) in BPA free zip-lock bags. We will also include instructions on how to begin making kefir with your grains. To ensure that your kefir grains arrive quickly and alive, we only ship with USPS priority mail.

15775,Capeline Hood Millinery Supply Twisted Paper,"
            Here we are selling a capeline made from twisted paper and ramie. 
It is a sturdy material and opposed to general view paper is one of the rainsafest summer millinerymaterial, especially when stiffened. But even unstiffened the twist in the paper gives it quite a lot of strength.
These make quite casual summerhats or nice cloches or mens hats as well. The price is for one Capeline only. 
If you take ten pieces I would sell them for 10 Euros each, but I would have to open a new arctile ad for that, so you´d have to let me know wether that would be of interest.
The one photo is of a finsihed hat, that is obviously not the thing for sale here, it is just to show what can be done with it.
Some people might prefer to wear a capeline as a hat already, although then I suggest still to sew in a sweatband.        ",10.55,,"Craft type: Hat making & hair crafts

16465,Uel Brew 1000: DIY Cold Brew Coffee Maker,"
            Cold brew creates the strongest, smoothest, least acidic coffee you can put in your face. And now you can too!
Brew like the self-proclaimed pros (us) with our miniature version of the exact same device we use to cold brew all of our cold brew, sized just right for your fridge as a one gallon bucket. 
Our simple, 100% cotton filter yields the juiciest texture we've found (compared to metal or paper), and by draining out of the side (instead of the very bottom) we leave the silt behind.
To cold brew, just set up your filter, add coffee, water, and stir... then set it and forget it! We brew for 24 hours at refrigerated temperature, then drain and enjoy.
This kit includes: 
1 Uel Brew 1000
4 stainless steel hooks
1 reusable hand-sewn 100% cotton muslin filter
2 empty ZINGbolt bottles
1 16 oz bag of our signature ZINGblend beans (optional: whole bean or coarse ground)

17752,Niobium earrings: 18 gauge Marquise,"
            These are made from .99 mm (.039 inch) niobium wire, just a bit bigger than the standard 20 gauge wire (.032 inch). They are not just for people who are gauging their piercings – this wire will comfortably go through an average piercing, but with a bit more presence. The front straight part is hand forged to flatten. The hammer marks give a little extra sparkle. Overall 1 3/4 inches (45 mm) from top to bottom. Because these are individually handcrafted, the pair you get may not be exactly like the pair in the photos, but they will be carefully matched to each other. Simple, light and easy to wear.
If you would like them coloured (free of charge!), just make your selection using the pull down menu. If you would like them in a variegated or ombre colour blend, feel free to contact me and I'll make a special listing just for you. Niobium is notoriously difficult to photograph and your monitor's display may be very different from mine, so please, read the names of the colours in the colour chart. The anodized colours of niobium are rich, saturated and bright.
These are available in larger gauge wire here:
http://www.etsy.com/shop/Element41?section_id=6876789
*Niobium is as hypo-allergenic as pure gold so these earrings can be worn by anyone and everyone. It is about 20% lighter than sterling silver and less than half the weight of gold.        ",27.00,4.962,"Handmade item

A bit about 14k GOLD FILLED,
Gold Filled is not like gold plated as there is approx 100 times more gold in gold fill, than there is on plated. 
Gold filled looks and usually wears as well as karat gold. 
Gold fill is very hard wearing and should last under normal wear conditions for a lifetime.

            A sweet and simple bar charm, hangs on an elegant chain.
All our jewelry has extra coat of layer on it, so it will not tarnish easily.
Perfect for everyday wear and looks great with other bracelet.
We engrave out bars with the latest engraving CNC. 
Pick from 3 colors. Gold, White or rose gold color.
Bracelet will have one inch of extender going both ways. So if you order size 6, I can be worn anywhere in between 5~7 inches. We do this so that you can wear it tighter or looser.
Some of the first class international shipping will not be able to be tracked. Because of this, We recommend that you order it in priority shipping. If the package is lost during the international shipping, and it can't be tracked, we will not be held responsible.  
**instructions**
The longer you make the coordinates, smaller the letters will be. To make the letters legible, I will round up the decimal points in the coordinates.
Examples: N40°42'46.0214"" S74°0'21.3888"" should be: N40° 42' 46"", S47° 0' 21""
If you can't use the degree symbol (°) then use asterix (*) to mark where you'd like the (°) to be.
Let us know the GPS coordinate you would like us to engrave on it. 
Also let us know how long you'd like the bracelet to be. 
The fifth picture shows some of the symbols we can engrave. 
**We will engrave it, just the way you've type to us. We are not responsible for your typos.

*SIZING*
Listed in both UK and EUR sizes. 
See the chart in the photos above for US sizes.
If you are unsure about sizing, feel free to message me! 
*TURNAROUND TIME*
These are hand painted and made to order. Due to the large range of sizes I do not keep them all in stock. I purchase the shoes in your size when you order and paint them just for you, and post them to you as fast as I can. 
This is usually around TWO WEEKS from the date your order is placed, but can vary from 4-21 days depending on how many orders I have at that time.
If you need them for a special occasion, please let me know in advance.
*PERSONALISATION*
These are all painted to order, which leaves room for the customer to request extra details/colours etc. 
*CARE INSTRUCTIONS*
These shoes are painted with a mix of acrylic paint and fabric medium, meaning the paint is permanent and waterproof and is totally safe to wear out in the rain. For maximum longevity, try to keep them dry and clean as you would with any canvas shoe. I do not advise machine washing, but a damp cloth won't cause any damage.
*SHIPPING* 
See prices for your country in the tab above, or message me if you're unsure. If you fall in to the ""everywhere else"" category for shipping and think the price is a little steep for your country, just send me a message and I'll calculate the actual cost for you        ",66.33,4.9545,"Handmade item

19625,Cream and Pink Bow Mary Jane Moccasin,"
            This item is a CREAM & LIGHT PINK mary jane moccasin.
All moccasins are made with genuine cow-leather. These baby and toddler shoes are perfect for developing feet because they are supple and move with your baby’s feet. With the stretchy elastic openings, it makes getting those wiggly toes in much easier! Rain or shine, Our soft soled leather moccasin will have your babies feet safely and fashionably covered! These are handmade products so they will never be exactly the same.
SIZING:
0-6m (11.2cm/4.4in)

18-24m (13.6cm/5.35in)
---ALL SALES ARE FINAL!!--- 
Please be sure to measure your little ones feet according to our measurements, NOT by their age as every babies foot grows at its own pace and differs per little one.

Back : Font will always be in Times New Roman or 1940s typewriter. It is better to have a legible not too fancy font so it can be easily read ( when your bag is lost) . Less smooth and looks a tag unfinished but that is just the texture of the leather. We can customize the back with anything that you want. Sometimes we dye the back a bit lighter so the text is more visible. 
Please include any information you want on the back of the tag during check out. We will not confirm your information. We will just cut, paste, and then engrave ( so please double check).

Luggage Tag Specs.
1. All our tags are made by hand ( in my workshop). We are located in the United States. 
2. Both sides can be personalized. The back of the tag is not as smooth and a bit more rustic looking. Please look at picture number two and make sure that you like the look because it cant be changed.  
3. Hardware is provided 
4.  Measures 3.5 "" long x 2 "" wide. 
5.  Color is saddle brown but may vary slightly from picture. All of our tags are hand dyed so please allow for variation.
                          IMPORTANT BRAMBE FACTS                             
1. We can engrave any quote that you want. There are no character or word limits. 
2. We do not STAMP or Letterpress our customizations. Our personalizations are burned into the leather. This means that your quote will not disappear or wear down.
3. We can also do any font size but we have a set formula that we tend to use as a guide. Sometimes the size font that you may like might not translate well.. Meaning the font could look quite large on your computer screen but will actually look small on the surface of the leather. 
4. Double check the information you give us for your personalization. We will simply cut and paste your note. If it is incorrect or misspelled that will be what you see on your passport. So please take a couple of minutes and read your quote out loud ( to yourself) to make sure there are no mistakes.
5. Sometimes the leather may have a nick or a slight dye imperfection. This is because we hand make all of our items. It is not considered a flaw. We just don't produce assembly line things. We process all of our leather and try to use every possible part. 
We are starting to list full hides. So if you are looking for something hide oriented send us a note.
