926,Antique Victorian Heart Padlock Locket with Key Pendant Charm. Key to My Heart. Wedding Charm.,"
            SO RARE! A Victorian heart key padlock with its ORIGINAL KEY! Padlock heart charms were very popular during the Victorian Era...a very romantic piece of jewelry symbolizing that they unlocked your heart or that they have the key to your heart...but over time most of the keys are lost....NOT this one!! 
I have added a gold filled extender to keep these two together but it is not original to the piece. 
The heart has pretty hand etched engraving and the gold is a very pretty rose gold. 
Marked S & M for Sommer & Mills Company from North Attleboro, Massachusetts, they were around from only 1897 until 1904 (and then became JJ Sommer & Company (J.J.S.) who were around until 1931)
Circa 1897-1904
Gold is either gold filled or a low grade gold (lower than 10K), it was acid tested and the line held with 10K acid for about 10 seconds and then faded. 
CONDITION:
Some scratches to the gold and there is wear by the top of the padlock (see last pic) Some small dents to the padlock - see pictures. 
Turn the key counter clockwise to open the padlock
MEASUREMENTS:
Heart is 20.32mm North to South 13.77 mm East to West
Key is 15mm long

2334,Vintage Niello Silver Snake Bracelet with Arabic Mosque Minaret and Boats,"
            Stunning Niello etched silver snake bracelet.
This dates to around 1930. It is not hallmarked (that is normal for these bracelets) but tests positive for sterling silver.  Niello is a technique that dates back to the Roman period and uses a mixture of one or more metallic sulfides (silver, copper, and lead) to fill the surface of etched silver, producing a beautiful blue-black that contrasts with the silver background.
This bracelet was probably made by the marsh arabs in the area around Iraq in the first half of the 1900s, likely 1920s - 1930s.  The engraving is very detailed and depicts life on the river with sailing boats (Balam) and what appears to be a mosque with minaret on land.  This is very unusual as most snake bracelets feature camels with their riders or sheep with a shepherd and is very elegant as well as beautifully engraved.
The bracelet is a single twist that winds it way sinuously around your lower arm. It is in fantastic condition with no damage to the Niello aside from a couple of air bubbles from the original crafting, no dents and can be gently adjusted for any size, looking fantastic on.  If adjusted, gently warm the silver in your hand before gradually adjusting the circle size between head and tail.
Size:  Current diameter 60mm, widest point 8mm
