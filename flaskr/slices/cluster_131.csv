6715,GREEN GRAMMAR PENCILS Ombre Coloured Pencil Set Gift for School English Teacher Graduation Present Colourful Retro Hex Gold Type BuzzFeed Uk,"
            Quirky set of ombre green retro hex pencils each showing a commonly mistaken grammar rule. Great English graduation gift or present for teachers. Featured by BuzzFeed.
These five pencils are the traditional hex shape with gold ferrules and pink erasers for a retro look. They have gold foil phrases pressed by hand onto the side...
- THERE, THEIR & THEY'RE (black)
- YOUR & YOU'RE (dark green)
- TO, TWO & TOO (mid green)
- WHERE, WERE, WEAR & WE'RE (light green)
- WHO, THAT & WHICH (white)
We also have a set of red ombre pencils showing a set of grammar rules for grammar nerds such as 'KNOW YOUR ITS FROM YOUR IT'S'.
In the Newton and the Apple shop, we have other gold-foil pressed pencil sets in range of colours, each with their own set of phrases. We also have a variety of science themed notebooks that would go well with the pencils to make a complete stationery gift.
MADE FROM: Five wooden HB hex pencils, colour coated and gold foil pressed with the purposeful phrases. Each pencil has a gold ferrule and pink eraser. These are standard lead pencils so will draw in grey, not colour.
DIMENSIONS: Pencils are 19 cm long. Supplied unsharpened.        ",9.95,4.9274,"Handmade item

This creamy vegan lipstick formula is handcrafted with an emollient-rich blend of moisturizing butters (unrefined cocoa, shea, and mango) to keep your lips feeling supple and conditioned throughout the day. There is no added scent or flavor, so they just have a subtle cocoa butter scent to them. While these lipsticks are packed with great natural moisturizers, you may still want to use a balm prior to application if your lips are very dry or accustomed to using non-vegan or petrolatum based lip products. Lipsticks are packaged in a slim balm tube for smooth and easy application; these do not twist back down, so only twist up the amount you intend to use.

Clean, musky and woody iso e super combined with velvety soft woods and intoxicating sweet spicy notes from roasted tonka beans. So unique that is hard to describe.

            Our Face Moisturizer Is an Oil Free Moisturizer!
When we say oil free we mean oil free.   During our extensive research into Face Moisturizers we found some of the top brands who called themselves oil free but had shea butter, sunflower oil or some other oil or butter in them.  Now how is that oil free, when you actually have oils in it?  Didn't make any sense to us, let alone being false advertising.
My wife has sensitive skin and cannot use our goats milk lotion, it is to heavy for her and she breaks out if she uses it to often.  I on the other hand have no problem with our lotion and I use it on a daily basis and love it. We have bunch of other men and women cutomers that have oily or combination skin and they have been after Silly Goats Soap Co., for awhile now to make an oil free Moisturizer.
Introducing Our New Oil Free Face Moisturizer!
So, the first question is always how do you moisturizer without using oils and lotions?  Here is how.
We use 4 things to moisturize – Aloe Vera, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Oat Protein, & Cetyl Alcohol.
*Aloe Vera Juice – Regularly applying aloe Vera gel to your face can help make your complexion clearer and smoother and reduce inflammation.
*Glycerin is a humectant, which means it draws moisture from the air to your skin.
*Cetyl alcohol is a fatty alcohol that offers emolliency (it is not alcohol alcohol that dries out your skin).
*Hydrolyzed Oat Protein hydrolyzed oats retain significantly more moisture at all humidities, gaining up to 50% more moisture at relative low humidity.
We also use a natural, and organic preservative in this premium, oil less moisturizer.
The reviews are in and everyone that has tried it loves it.  
Sandy says""I have been using it for a month now and my face has never been so soft.  I also have not broken out since I  started using the Oil Less Moisturizer!"". 
 
Joan says ""Love it, my face and neck have never felt so smooth and soft!""
​Just a side note –  Our customers with sensitive skin who are looking for a gentle cleaning and moisturizing routine are using the Bastile Beauty Bar, along with the Face Moisturizer to keep their skin pampered, healthy and younger looking.  Both of them together make a great combination!
Ingredients: Water, Aloe Barbadensis Juice, Vegetable Glycerin, Goat Milk, Hydrolyzed Oats, Behentrimonium Methosulfate (and) Cetyl Alcohol (and) Butylene Glycol, (natural preservative) silver citrate, citric acid & potassium sorbate, vitamin E.

            ***Please read product description before ordering. Feel free to ask questions about our products.***
You will receive 1 (raw cast/ unpainted) Unicorn Horn and 2 (raw cast/ unpainted) pony ears. 
This set is cast in Smooth Cast 65D impact resistant white-urethane resin. They have had the flashing from the molding process removed; however sanding, painting, and finishing is required by you. Our pieces are handmade with care, however small imperfections may appear as they are raw casts. 
The original models are hand sculpted based on our own designs. These pieces are rigid and durable. They resist moisture, moderate heat, solvents, diluted acids, and can be machined, primed/painted or bonded to other surfaces. If machining (sanding, drilling, or dremeling) your piece, wear a dust mask or other apparatus to prevent inhalation of residual particles. Castings can be displayed outdoors after priming and painting. Unpainted castings will yellow over time - more quickly when exposed to ultraviolet light. We recommend filling small imperfections with glazing putty (follow manufactures instructions), sanding (wear respiratory protection), and painting with a quality spray paint or acrylic of your choice. 
We are happy to answer questions about finishing any of our casts.        ",14.00,4.9841,"Handmade Supply

            You get one package of 8-10"" African Porcupine Quills Needles for quillwork, art projects, costumes,hair picks, basketry, etc.  Choose package size to right of photos.  These longer quills tend to be on the thinner side and most are between 2mm and 4 mm wide at their thickest point.  Quills are a popular decorative items as shown in the 3rd photo (wooden bowl not included).  These needles are very sharp so be careful!  African porcupine quills have sharp tips but the sides are smooth.  They do not have the microscopic reverse barbs like the smaller North American porcupine quills have.  Porcupine quills are also popular for art projects and quillwork.  Photos are stock photos, you will not get these exact quills but ones very similar.  Other quills here: 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/EvasFeathers/search?search_query=quills&order=date_desc&view_type=gallery&ref=shop_search
 .  Other drilled natural items here: 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/EvasFeathers/search?search_query=drilled&order=date_desc&view_type=gallery&ref=shop_search
 .
Most quills are harvested from live porcupines with minimal effort.  They fall out easily and regrow quickly.  A typical method involves touching or draping the animal with a piece of fabric and then removing it.  Numerous quills come out easily into the fabric.  In some countries, porcupine is also a popular type of meat for eating and is considered a delicacy.  Porcupines have few natural predators and their population density can be quite high.  
Foreign customers, my apologies but US export law does not allow me to ship wild animal products out of country.

  How to clean brass and silver?
Brass and silver oxidize naturally with time and with contact to the skin. This is a beautiful and natural look of the metals, but it's possible with a bit of cleaning once in a while to maintain the new, shining, bright look of the metal. Use a bit of lemon or vinegar to soak the jewel, and a soft cloth to rub the jewel until it shines again. There are also special cloths (that contains a sort of gentle acid) for cleaning metals, usually sold in jewelry stores.
If you need any further help please feel free to contact us.

Abalone Shell meaning
""Shells are made up of calcium carbonate and grow in the ocean, forming part of a living ecosystem. Various types of shell have been used as gems for centuries. One of these types include those made up of pearly layers: mother of pearl, abalone and New Zealand paua.
Abalone shell has been used in many cultures as a decorative jewelry and for carvings. A disc of abalone shell is worn on the forehead of Apache girls as they greet the sun in the morning of their initiation into womanhood.
Abalone strengthens the structure of the body and the functions of the heart chakra. Both pearl and abalone shell hold the same divinatory meaning:
Intimately connected to the sea - represents the tides of emotion
An easy flow of feelings and sensitivities to others
Connected to family and particularly motherhood
Harmony in relationships
The play and variety of colors represent change as the beauty of existence.""

Taking care of your septum ring:
  How to use a septum ring-
In order of taking care of your new septum, it's important to open it side ways and never up. Just push gently the opening side away from you, while the other side stays in place. Insert the ring and then push the top gently back. opening and closing the septum ring in this way will keep it's original shape. If you need any further instructions you are welcome to contact us.
  How to clean brass and silver?
Brass and silver oxidize naturally with time and with contact to the skin. This is a beautiful and natural look of the metals, but it's possible with a bit of cleaning once in a while to maintain the new, shining, bright look of the metal. Use a bit of lemon or vinegar to soak the jewel, and a soft cloth to rub the jewel until it shines again. There are also special cloths (that contains a sort of gentle acid) for cleaning metals, usually sold in jewelry stores.
If you need any further help please feel free to contact us.

Created from my original moon cat illustration, these super cute enamel pins are perfect for any jacket, bag, hat, shirt collar or anywhere else you feel like pinning them! I love how glossy the hard enamel is, with the gold metal shining through. 
The cat face is a very pale blue enamel, with white enamel eyes and shiney gold metal moon detail.
The super cute pins measure around 2cm high and 3cm wide with a lapel pin back and yellow rubber clutch ready to pin wherever you like. Show the world just how much you like CATS!
