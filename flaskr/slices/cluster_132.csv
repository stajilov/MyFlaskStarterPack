            LOT 50 Sempervivum plants in assorted colors & textures (note: assorted colors only, customers cannot request a specific color). These will grow when you plant them in soil.
Assorted Sempervivum offsets. Plants are the size of a dime (0.75 inches in diameter). Varieties are growers choice only and do not have name labels. Selected from all categories for texture, color, and variety. All of the plants are shipped bare-root.
IDEAS for wedding/ event:
1. a beautiful small pot decoration (picture#5)
2. perfect centerpiece with votive candle glass with decorative colorful sand
3. guest name tag holder
4. gift favor
Handling time about 5 business days (plus USPS Priority 2-3 days)
How to get these sooner?
Select Ship OUT - departure ""Ship in 3 bus days"" with additional 20 will make arrival sooner.
I have a lot of 50 sempervivum in plug trays which include a tray and each plant has established roots in soil. Check here: 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/rainforestrosecom?ref=shopsection_shophome_leftnav&section_id=14835474
Do I need plants with plastic pots?
At formal events (wedding, party), most people use pretty containers for display. Bare-root or plugs are perfect for that purpose, just put sempervivum on top of your soil mix in a cute container.  
How to grow:
Sempervivum is in general hardy to zone 4. Fast draining soil medium is an absolute must for this plant to survive. It is extremely drought tolerant, but will succumb rapidly when allowed to languish in very damp soil. They do require some protection against very intense mid-day sun and heat.
