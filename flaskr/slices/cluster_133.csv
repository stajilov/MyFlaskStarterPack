676,Meme's Monster Pants - Multiple Sizes - Monster Bum Pants - Super Soft Yarns -Kids Clothing - Open Airy Stitching- Custom Colors at Request,"
            This is my version of the popular Monster Pants. The yarn I choose has a silky, soft feel. I used a crochet stitch that leaves the pants open and airy opposed to a more closed, knitted stitch that can be a little warmer. 
These trendy little Monsters are available in Multiple Sizes and I can do Custom Colors if you don't see the color you want. Just message me 1 main color and 2 accent colors.
Sizing (non-cinched waist):
0-3 month - 6"" inseam - 16"" waist
3-9 month - 7.5"" inseam - 18"" waist
9-15 month - 8.5"" inseam - 20"" waist
15-24 month - 9.5"" inseam - 22"" waist
2T-3T 11"" inseam - 22"" waist
additional sizes upon request, just need waist size and leg inseam
I use standard sizes, but if you can slow your little Monsters down long enough to get some measurements; waist (circumference) and leg measurement (inseam), we can get a custom fit. 
I have done many custom colors so don't hesitate to ask for your favorite colors.
These adorable Monster Pants have a drawstring waist which makes it adjustable and a ribbed ankle cuff that can be rolled up or down to add length.
Please contact me with any questions, I'd love to make a pair for your little monster.
Made with Love,

8593,Bicycle made from recycled bike chain.-you know you want one.,"
            This is a bicycle made from repurposed bicycle chain.  Each link is welded together on the back side to keep the shape.
Excellent gift for the bike enthusiast in your life.  Not only does it look like a bike, but it is made from recycled bicycle parts. 
Each item is hand made, so the specific size varies a bit, but they are approximately 8 inches long and 5 inches tall.  The finish also varies and is dependent on the type of chain I use.  Some chain has a rustic gray look , some chain rusts after the welding process, some has a bluish tint, some is shiny chrome, and some of the previously listed types get an iridescent effect.  If you have a preference, I will try to accommodate it if possible and will let you know if I have the chain to do it.  Please note that this item is a creation of the artist and my interpretation of a bicycle.  As I said, I will try to accommodate color preferences, but any request for a different size, shape, base, etc. will be charged a premium above my normal price (separate listing specific to request) and will be paid for before I make it.

            Custom house paintings in pen and ink with watercolor are very sweet and a fun gift!  The small 4 x 6 inch size is very affordable and also is very cute.  Go up in size and you get more of a painting but it is still charming!  I include lots of detail so the character of the house really comes through at any size. 
If you want more than one, each will be matted and you can have a nice set for a wall grouping.  Some people will get all the houses they've lived in as a couple, or as a house warming present.  I had a fun order that was a set for a wedding present that included the church, historic reception building, and a honeymoon hotel.  
Any kind of building is appropriate from tall apartments to a woodsy cottage, or perhaps a new business - a garage, a restaurant, a beauty parlor...  
All I need is a photo from you attached to the ""ask a question"" button on this page, and I will draw it in pen and ink, paint it with watercolor, and mat it, and send it back to you as soon as I can.  Also I can use the Google map street view photo.

9203,"1"" precision spinning top ""TriStripe Black Copper"" EDC made of copper over aluminium. Great gift. Spinning time up to 10min.","
            This precision spinning top is turned out of copper over aluminium on metal lathe. It has a ceramic ball contact point.
Dimensions: D=25mm H=30mm
Spinning time up to 10 min.
A spinning top is not just a child’s toy. It is also an adult toy, in the sense that it helps to figure out how it works. Besides, some adults DO play with spinning tops, and some make very elegant ones. A spinning top is remarkable because it tends to defy gravity while it is spinning. If spun fast enough, a spinning top will rise to a vertical position and happily stay there, despite the fact that it will fall over if it stops spinning.
Suppose a top is so perfectly fashioned that its principal rotation axis (spin axis) goes through its center of mass. (The center of mass, also known as the center of gravity, is the balance point of the object.) If we spin this top carefully, so that it remains perfectly upright while spinning (and gravity can't exert a torque on it about its point), it will spin at a steady angular velocity almost indefinitely. Sliding friction between its tip and the floor does slow it gradually. But if the point is very sharp, sliding friction there exerts very little torque on the top about its rotational axis. Because it's unable to exert a torque on the ground, the top can't exchange angular momentum with the earth. It spins on until it slowly gets rid of its angular momentum through sliding friction and air resistance.
In general, the world is not this accomodating. A slight mismatch between the spin axis and the center of mass will guarantee that gravity exerts a torque on the top about its tip. The rapidly spinning top will precess in a direction determined by the torque exerted by its weight. The precession angular velocity is inversely proportional to the spin angular velocity, so that the precession is faster and more pronounced as the top slows down.        ",27.76,5.0,"Handmade item

Tan Bunny Hand Puppet
This lifelike hand puppet is sure to entertain all ages, from baby to grandma. 
Hand puppets are great for purely creative play, unlike so many other toys on the market. Mine are designed to provide easy, realistic movement.   The head is partially stuffed, so your hand can go all the way to the nose.  All four legs are open, so the puppet can walk, scratch it's ears, rub it's eyes and nose, play peek-a-boo, etc.  The tummy has a little padded piece inside that rests comfortably right in the palm of your hand and gives each of my puppets a nice full shape, without hindering your capability to move the puppet.
My hand puppets are very durable. I started making these in 1981 and frequently hear stories from people who bought them 15-20 years ago, and still have them after many childhood years of use!
This puppet measures about 8 1/2"" from the nose to the opening for your hand.  It is constructed with high-quality American made faux fur.  
The eyes are securely attached with a special washer on the inside. 
Also available in white.
Machine washable.        ",25.00,5.0,"Handmade item

            This is Trinette (her name means 'little innocent'), she's a fully customised Takara Neo Blythe doll (base doll Simply Vanilla FBL).
Her stock Blythe body has been replaced with a genuine Pure Neemo body. 
Her pull cords are decorated with glass beads.  
I have spent many hours customising her. 
I hope you love her finished look as much as I loved creating it. 
Custom work carried out:
Sand matting.
Carving of nose, nostrils, philtrum, mouth, lip lines and chin.
Painted lips, eyeshadow and blush, using chalk pastels and watercolour pencils. 
All fully sealed with matte MSC UV Cut.
New eyelashes. 
Eyes boggled and gaze lifted.
Sleep eyes.
About the eye chips:
Two sets of Puppelina chips and two sets of my hand painted metallic chips.
Her lids have a floral pattern fabric.
About the Scalp:
Her scalp is from Urban Cowgirl so there is a small gap where the scalp is glued on at the back, but this is completely hidden by the hair.
About the body:
Her replacement Pure Neemo body is articulated and poseable with a tilty neck.
About the outfit: 
She will travel in the outfit in the last photo: overalls and t shirt, lace up boots, plus the furry bear hat.
Visit her Flickr page for more pics:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/75903964@N08/
She will be shipped in her ""Simply Vanilla"" Blythe box with its stock stand; sent tracked and insured for peace of mind of both buyer and seller.
Please bear in mind that this is a hand customised doll, therefore she is not ""factory perfect"".

This is a listing for ONE of the custom fan-sprites of Persona 3, created by Paul Robertson (the maker of the Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game sprites). Each sprite is over a foot tall and around 5-6 inches wide. Except Koromaru-san; he's a bit wider...seeing as he's a dog. Dogsona!
We are not limited by just the sprites in the picture! If you'd prefer ANY main character from the game, let us know! A reference sheet can be found here:
http://paulrobertson.mechafetus.com/persona3a.gif
You will need to let us know in the order which of these sprites you'd like.
For a limited time, we will also offer a discount: two for 55 (that's 5 off!). Please contact directly if you want to use this discount! What an un-bear-able discount! Wait, that's Persona 4.

10676,"Corkstone Cork Turntable Mat Custom Spot-mat, Vinyl Lp Record Mat, Audiophile","
            Specs:
1.) Total Thickness = 1/4"" inch or roughly 6.35 mm
2.) Total Diameter = 11 - 5/8"" inch or roughly 29.53 cm 
3.) The mat has 16 cork dots. The dots are designed to be equally placed around the mat giving proper and even support to the grooves!
4.) The mats are produced from ""PURE HIGH QUALITY CORK"" Not cheap gasket cork. This is the best quality cork we have to offer! 
5.) The spot-mat supports 12"", 10"", and 7"" records! 
6.) Due to the dense cork material, this mat offers the best improvements to bass and treble frequencies! 
7.) Helps absorb unwanted vibrations!
8.) Each Corkstone Mat will have its own characteristics. All of these mats are different from each other but they come from the same source of cork. The pictures are to give you an idea of what to expect. Each Corkstone Mat is unique and special!
Design Purpose
	This cork spot-mat is designed so that the record rests on the dots and leaves a small gap between the record and the actual cork mat base. This design helps absorb unwanted vibrations and boosts the highs and lows of the vinyl. The dots support the grooves of the vinyl, giving it the most support when the stylus comes in contact with the record. A vinyl record is naturally thicker at the center label and the outer groove. (or the lead in) The dots do not come in contact with the thicker parts of the record, the center label or the outer groove, so the vinyl lays level with cork mat.
Maintenance
	Please keep cork mat clean of any dirt and dust. Use a soft bristle brush, like a good new and unused paint brush, to clean/brush it every once in a while.        ",30.00,5.0,"Handmade item

We really love good London Blue Topaz... But that's not what this is -- this might even be better and it's called Neptune Garden Topaz. Created in response to some people's fears about the radiation used to create London Blue, this is a clear topaz that has been treated with Titanium on the back of the stone (where it can't be worn off...) and honestly, it throws far better color. Both Blue and Green flash around incessantly. 
This ring is a nice design; three CZ accents set around two 1 ct colored gemstones. A really pretty Sterling Silver ring -- very solid construction. This is one of those rings you'll pass down to your daughter..
Pretty enough to wear out in the evening.
Please notice the thickness of the silver in this mounting.  These are substantial, without being weighty.  I like my stones well protected, and I assume you do too!  At SylvaRocks, this is the way we make our jewelry.  We don't skimp on metal, and our stones are always hand picked.  
This ring just looks great!
____________________________________________________________________
BTW, Since we make this from scratch after you order it, we have a lot of flexibility.  We can also cast this in yellow, white or rose gold, and in any of 10k, 14k, or 18k.  Obviously, these choices will affect the price, but email us and let us know what you're interested in, and we'll give you the best price we can live with.  We enjoy a strong repeat business, and keep it by making good jewelry you'll want to wear at prices that we both can live with.        ",42.03,4.9372,"Handmade item
