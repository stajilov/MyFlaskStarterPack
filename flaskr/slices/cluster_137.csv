1279,"Vintage Soviet men's ""East"" ( ""VOSTOK"") automatic, Komandirskie watch , 21 jewels movement , great Vintage watch, new band. Amphibian!","
            Vintage men's Soviet wristwach ""Komandirskie ""  ""EAST""- ("" Vostok""). 21 jewels movement. Automatic! Amphibian!
This 1980's Vostok Komandirskie'  is a lovely civilian version of the Russian military watch. More information you can find here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_watches
The watch has been fully serviced,cleaned and oiled by a professional watch maker.The watch is working very accurately.
Vostok (Russian: Восток, meaning East*).The Vostok Company was founded in 1942 when one of the Moscow watch-making plants of the First Moscow Watch Factory was evacuated to Chistopol, a small town located on the Kama River in Tatarstan. Only defence equipment was produced during the war years, but as soon as the war was over the company started making mechanical wrist watches. However, the Company did not begin using the ""Vostok"" brand name until the 1960s. *Presumable ""Vostok"" brand was named after the Vostok space programme, which gave the initial advancement of the USSR in the Space race (as some others soviet watch brands, named to space topics in 1960s - Poljot and Raketa).

2860,French Vintage Wallpaper for Crafting and Projects. Lovely Selection of Patterns from 1920-1950.,"
            Lovely selection of vintage French wallpaper patterns from 1920-1950.
Would  be ideal for craft projects, scrapbooking, decoupage, and 
many more.
Ten pieces in total ranging in size from :-
7"" x 9""  to  8"" x 10""  (18 cm x 23 cm) to (23 cm x 25 cm)
If one or two are smaller I will add an extra piece, all genuine paper 
from the era and in good vintage condition. Some slight foxing and 
nibbles to one or two at the selvedge but all very usable.
Some of the older papers are a little fragile so care needed in handling, 
but some of the images are amazing and having been stored in an attic,
the colours are bright.
They will be packed in a padded envelope with card to keep them flat.

            Nice Gillette men's adjustable I-2 metal razor. This razor was an estate find and in very nice condition. After doing some research I found that the Gillette I-2 razor was made in 1963 and based off research it has a slimmer handle.
I did clean the razor but you may desire to further clean it as it was a previously used item.
I would imagine that these razors are the way to go for a closer shave and less disposable waste.
Nice condition-Opens and closes as it should, some light wear.

            Pictured here is a really nice vintage Marx wind-up tin 4 piece train set from the 1950's.
The 4 piece train set consists of a black locomotive engine which is 8 inches in length, a black New York Central #551 coal car which measures 6 inches in length, a yellow & red Baltimore & Ohio Hopper  #241708 which measures 6 inches in length and a  red & gray caboose #20102 which is 6 inches in length. It  also comes with 9 train track pieces and a homemade key (see picture).
The engine winds -up great & works but does not spark since the flint is missing. Three of the train pieces are marked with the symbol ""MAR"", Made In United States Of America, New York, N.Y. in a circle. It is missing 1 piece of curved train track & missing 5 pins. It shows wear to all of the pieces due to its advanced age but a really sharp looking train set from the past and still in great shape for a vintage train set made back in the 1950's.

9231,Vintage Wind Up Tin Race Car,"
            With real estate it's ""Location, Location, Location"", right?  With toys, though, it's ""Condition, Condition, Condition"".  To that end here is one of two absolutely beautiful wind up tin cars that I recently acquired.  Take a good look at the pictures and you'll see a car that lead a very sheltered life.  How long a life that has been is somewhat of a mystery, so we're going to call it pre-1997.  Given its classic wind up mechanism, simple paint scheme and mid-60's open wheel race car style, it seems reasonable that it dates roughly from the Kennedy administration.  There are no maker marks or other distinguishable characteristics that would shed some light on who made this car, unfortunately.  If someone more knowledgeable than me sees this and wants to let me know, I would definitely appreciate it.  
The wind up mechanism functions as it should and the car will roll across the floor, though it's unlikely to set any land speed records in your living room.  I spent exactly zero seconds cleaning this car as I like things that are ""barn fresh"", and am banking on you, dear potential customer, feeling the same way.  A careful cleaning will no doubt reveal an even more attractive patina than what's visible in the photographs.
If you have any questions about anything I sell or care to discuss which George Harrison solo songs should have been Beatles recordings, feel free to drop me a line anytime.  As I rarely sleep, I'll get back to you surprisingly fast.  There are many more yard sale, junk store and estate sale items on their way so check back often as I attempt to sell you neat stuff.        ",39.95,4.9074,"Vintage item

--- CUSTOMER SERVICE & SATISFACTION GUARANTEE ---
We take pride in the fact that CitivaCreationz has one of the best reputations within the hoop community for providing amazing customer service to thousands of hoopers over the last five years. We are all hoopers here at CitivaCreationz, so we understand that this is a special purchase and we want to make sure that you are satisfied with your purchase. If you aren't happy with your CitivaCreationz LED hoop, you have one week from the delivery date to return it for a refund, no questions asked!
--- CONSCIOUSLY CRAFTED ---
Every step is taken to ensure that we leave the smallest carbon footprint possible when creating your hoops! Most of our materials are custom made and sourced locally, all packaging we receive with materials is reused, hoop boxes and shipping bags are made from recycled post consumer waste, shipping labels are printed on recycled paper, 100% of the unusable waste created is recycled (torn boxes, ends of tubing rolls, etc), and supplies are ordered in large quantities so that the delivery trucks have to make fewer trips to our shop! We are constantly finding new ways to improve reduce our impact on the environment, and by supporting us you too are supporting that movement!
--- WORRY-FREE WARRANTY ---
This hoop comes with a one year worry-free warranty which covers labor costs, burned out LEDs and wiring problems caused by a defect in construction. If your hoop ever needs to be repaired, just send it in and we will have it returned to you in a jiffy!
--- LED SEQUENCE ---
This hoop contains solid strobe LEDs sequenced in rainbow order around the hoop. Choose to have the hoop made with 18 LEDs, 27 LEDs or 36 LEDs. With the 18 LED and 27 LED option, there is NO battery gap (the 36 LED option is spaced closer together so there is a 1"" battery gap/dark spot.)
--- TUBING ---
You can choose for this hoop to be made with either HDPE tubing or PolyPro tubing. With LED hoops, there is no noticeable difference in weight between the two types due to the extra weight of the components inside. We do not recommend one or the other, your decision should be made on what feels right to you...HDPE is more springy and PolyPro is more rigid. Keep in mind that PolyPro is more prone to cracking in colder temperatures, and is not available with 38"" hoops.
--- LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGN ---
Hoops in 3/4"" tubing weigh about 12 ounces, and hoops in 5/8"" tubing weigh about 8 ounces. The number of LEDs does not affect the weight. If you would like weight added to your hoop, just leave a note with your purchase and I will add extra weights for free!
--- COUNTER-BALANCED & RATTLE-FREE ---
Each hoop is counter-balanced for an even flow while hooping. The internal wires are also padded so that there is NO RATTLING during use, which ensures your hoop will have a long, happy life. 
--- COLLAPSIBLE ---
This hoop will collapse down to half its original size making it ideal for road trips, airplane travel, hiking excursions, bike rides and carrying around at festivals/events. You can take this hoop on any airline, and it is not counted as a carry-on! Protect your hoop and transport it easily with a custom handmade hoop bag ---  
https://www.etsy.com/listing/109482262
--- CONNECTION --- 
This hoop will turn on and off with a simple push button mechanism. This design is incredibly durable, and makes switching out batteries a cinch. Perfect for events where you don't have access to electricity! Choose between a standard 'outer' connection, or an upgraded 'inner' connection*. The inner connection has a smooth, sleek appearance and is slightly more balanced for the more advanced hooper. Please note that while the outer connector has an 'off' position, the inner connector does not (meaning you will have to remove the battery when you want to turn the hoop off.) Refer to photos for a comparison. *Inner connections are NOT available for 38"" hoops!
--- BATTERY & CHARGER ---
Each hoop requires only one battery to turn on. You will receive one wall charger and one rechargeable lithium-ion battery with your order. Each battery takes about 2 hours to charge and will give you 1-2 hours of glow time on a full charge. Extra batteries are recommended so that you're never left in the dark! Be sure that you purchase the correct size of battery for your hoop - all 5/8"" hoops will require the 'Featherweight (10440)"" size and all 3/4"" hoops will require the 'Normal (14500)"" size. Batteries ship for free when purchased with an LED hoop. Purchase for 5 each here ---  
www.etsy.com/listing/76712206
--- SIZING OPTIONS ---
You may choose from a variety of even-numbered sizes between 26"" and 38"". If you would prefer an in-between size (31"", 33"", etc) be sure to include that in the NOTE TO SELLER box at checkout along with what size tubing you prefer! CitivaCreationz LED hoops are measured by outside diameter, meaning from outside edge to outside edge. Not sure which size you need? Here are some recommendations...
~38"" OD (X-Large) : This size is great for beginner hoopers OR curvy body types OR tall body types (over 5'8"") OR hoopers who prefer a slower hooping style. *Inner connection NOT available for 38"" hoops!
~36"" OD (Large) : This size is the most popular and recommended for anyone who doesn't fit into any of the other size descriptions. Great for intermediate hoopers and children under 12.
~34"" OD (Medium) : This size is the second most popular and is perfect for those of you who have a smaller body frame, or prefer a faster style of hooping with intermediate/advanced skills.
~32"" OD (Small) : This size is primarily for hoopers who prefer off-body and advanced tricks, or who have a very small body type.
~30"" OD (X-Small) or 28"" OD (XX-Small): This size is for advanced and/or off-body hoopers. Also a great size for doubles. Not recommended for anyone who hasn't used this size hoop before!
--- GRIP OPTIONS ---
POLYPRO hoops will come BARE (no tape) with a piece of sandpaper which you can use to rough up the tubing enough to make it grippy. If you would like tape for your PolyPro hoop, you can purchase here: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/126174992
HDPE hoops will come with gaffers grip tape along the inner rim, just enough for grip but not so much that it blocks the lights. If you would prefer your HDPE hoop to come bare or with sandpaper instead, please leave a note with your purchase. 
--- SHIPPING OPTIONS --- 
Hoops ship standard with USPS Priority service, which takes about 2-5 days for delivery in addition to the turnaround/creation time listed under the 'Shipping' tab on this listing. At checkout, you may be offered the option to upgrade to USPS Priority Express (Next Day) service, which takes 1-2 days for delivery in addition to 1-2 days creation time, so your hoop will be guaranteed to arrive within 2-4 days of purchase! The expedited option is not available when the turnaround time is listed as being 3 weeks or longer. Before you check out, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ENTER THE CORRECT SHIPPING ADDRESS AT CHECKOUT, AND INCLUDE ANY APARTMENT/UNIT NUMBERS.

--- TRACKING AND INSURANCE ---

12691,Wedding Flower Preservation - Real Pressed Flower Anniversary Gift,"
            Wedding flowers. We think about the perfect look, we take all the photos, and then after the ceremony what happens? We throw them away? We attempt to preserve them in kitty litter? We send them off to be freeze dried only to spend the rest of our marriage dusting them off on a weekly basis?
Why not consider hanging them on your wall as a piece of botanical art?
By purchasing this listing before your wedding day, I can prepare for your bridal bouquet to arrive and get to work pressing it as soon as I receive it. You have the option of supplying me with sentimental text, your wedding invitation, or even your wedding photo, and I will use the actual flowers from your wedding day to decorate the page.
When you purchase this listing, I will contact you via etsy to work out the exact details of your order and give you the address to ship your bouquet to. This listing does not cover the postage of your bouquet, but I will send you detailed instructions for you to get it to me in the best condition. 
Alternatively, this makes a great wedding anniversary present. I can source the flowers used in your wedding (for an additional fee) or use symbolic wildflowers to make a meaningful gift. 
Please contact me if you have any questions before purchasing. I look forward to working with your ideas!
Like all my work, the flowers will be preserved with additional UV protection to resist color fade and deterioration, but care should be given to keep the piece out of direct sun. I ship these pieces unframed for you to pick a frame that best matches your decor. For best results, frame with UV resistant plexi.        ",75.00,5.0,"Handmade item

14919,"5m of Goldschild Linen Thread, non-waxed, 3-ply","
            This listing is for 5m of Goldschild's Linethread, NeL 18/3 linen (sold in the USA as Londonderry thread). It is made from the longest and most valuable line fibres of the flax plant.
This thread is good for a broad variety of textile works, most noteworthy embroidery, lace making, and crocheting. It is dyed using traditional techniques which give beautiful, natural looking results which are light and water resistant.
NeL 18/3 is one of the standard thicknesses for bookbinding, however, this thread is softer and not as tightly twisted as bookbinding thread usually is. It is an interesting addition to a bookbinder's repertoire of thread nonetheless. It can be used for binding light and small books (like one signature pamphlets), for Asian stab bindings, or for decorative stitches including headbands and embroidery on covers.
Satisfied customers have also used it for crocheting interesting jewellery like accessories, embroidery on leather and used it as a colourful string for packing merchandise. 
Generally the colors survive washing at 60°, but the thread might shrink. Pull in shape and dry under tension to prevent embroidered fabrics from warping and distorting.
PLEASE NOTE:
-----------------------
Colours viewed on a screen look different than the real thing, the photos in this listing are only for reference.
Furthermore the exact color varies from dye lot to dye lot. Therefore thread bought under the same name at different times may look different. Better order enough thread to last through your whole project.        ",4.18,4.9907,"Craft type: Bookbinding, Crewel, Crochet, Embroidery, Needlepoint, Tatting & lacemaking

15693,Napa Wine Barrel Staves set of 15,"
            These staves are reclaimed from a Northern California wine barrel.
The barrels were used in production housing wine for  years.
Each set of staves made of solid white oak, come from the same barrel, and are richly soaked red from the wine that was stored inside.  
The staves are 37"" long and range from 1"" -4"" in width.  Each set of fifteen will have a variety of different widths but all will be the same length.
If you are looking for larger quantities or need certain widths please contact me and I can get you a quote.
Feel good about doing business with The Winey Guys, re-inventing what we can, to help our environment.
All Winey Guys products are created from recycled wine barrels. Since all barrels are unique in size, character and color, there are slight differences among like products. These variations do not affect the function or durability of Winey Guys products, but do add a one of a kind touch to each piece we create. Enjoy!        ",75.00,4.974,"Handmade item

---------------------------------
MATERIALS
GOLD-FILLED JEWELRY:
- Under normal wearing conditions and with proper care, your gold filled jewelry should last at least 10 years.
- 14kt Gold-Filled jewelry is made by bonding a solid layer of 14kt gold on top of another metal, but this layer is 1000 - 10,000 times thicker than gold plating, resulting in a durable, long-lasting product that looks gorgeous like solid gold.
- Gold-Filled jewelry can also be worn by people with sensitive skin.
STERLING SILVER:
- We use .925 Sterling Silver, which requires polishing from time to time from oxidation. You can easily restore silver back to shine with a polishing cloth or use a polishing lotion for that extra shine.
---------------------------------
GIFT PURPOSES
- If this is a gift, we can also send the jewelry piece to the recipient. Please simply put down the recipient's address as the shipping address when you checkout.
- We can also include a little card with a message for you inside- Let us know in the ""Note to Seller"" section when you check out.
