            This is the well known style if wicks for any fire hoop...just add your own hoop!  Sold individually, they come with a nut driver tool for every purchase of 5 wicks.  No exceptions!! 5 wicks must be purchased to receive the tool.  
The banding is adjustable and will fit onto 5/8"" tubing (It's suggested that you tape down the ends to keep them from catching on your hands or clothing) , 3/4"" polypro or HDPE. It will also fit onto PE tubing that has an OD of 1"" max.  
**these wicks have a lifetime warranty on the hardware. Warranty does not carry over to the wicking, as normal wear and repeated use does limit the life of the wicks.  For wick longevity, read about methods used to prolong them.  Personally mine are three years old and going strong!        ",26.50,4.987,"Handmade item
