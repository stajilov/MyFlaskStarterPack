8428,Midwife or Doula Gift - New Mom Gift - Personalized Nursery Wall Art - Baby Shower Gift - Design #39,"
            This sweet mother & baby silhouette celebrates both where momma originated and where baby boy or girl was born! Made from professionally-printed maps, the entire silhouette can be one location, or the mother shape can be one location and the baby can be another ( - such as in the photos shown here). 
**For the map location you can choose either a U.S. state or a country and let me know if there is a specific city or cities you would like showing (For example - The cities of Westminster and Lexington showing in the photos). 
Although I can usually accommodate most locations, due to the larger size and shape of this silhouette it is occasionally a little more challenging as far as placement. However, I put these together so that they look the best that they possibly can and will let you know if I have any design concerns. 
I can leave the silhouette without any script or per your request add script either above or below the silhouette with any quote or sentiment you would like (See photo 4 for examples). The script comes printed black on light gray paper, layered over another color of your choice. Colors currently in stock for the bottom layer are matte metallic silver. shiny metallic in gold, silver or rose gold, deep cranberry red, black, deep teal blue, and for smaller/shorter phrases and wording a metallic bronze is also available.  Also, please see the fifth photo for script font choices.
Please indicate all of your preferences in the Note to Seller box when you order!
Specifics:
- Total paper size is 8 by 10 inches. 
- Materials: a mother & baby silhouette carefully hand-cut from professionally-printed maps, mounted on solid archival-quality art paper with somewhat of a mottled finish to add some visual interest to the piece. 
- The black ""stitching"" marks are hand drawn by me.
- Free optional gift-wrapping is available! Just indicate that you would like gift-wrapping when you order and any special message that you would like attached.
***Each piece of wall art will look a little different due to the personalized one-of-a-kind nature of the map heart locations & maps needed to find them. I make an effort to put these pieces together in such a way that they will look the best that they possibly can!
*** Art comes unframed but easily fits a standard 8x10 size art or photo frame.
-  -  -  This is a wonderful personalized gift for a mother-to-be, young family, midwife or doula, etc.!  <- <- <-
**When ordering, in the ""Note to Seller"" section please indicate your desired location (State or country. as well as any city you'd like featured.) 
*Turnaround time to create your art and have it shipped is usually 7 to 10 days. Rush orders are possible on a case by case basis.

Internally the book is clean with a few small marks. There is only a little foxing to the page edges. Book measures approx. 190x130cms (7.5x5.5in).

******************************************
TARNISH on Copper and Brass and MAY TURN YOUR SKIN GREEN..
Copper and brass do tarnish very quickly.  Once you put the Renaissance Paste on them this will slow that down the process.
OR YOU CAN ADD A LACQUER FINISH.
Your blanks may arrive with a slight bit of tarnish.  A quick solution for tarnished copper and brass blanks is to get a bowl full of soy sauce. I know it sounds weird, but it works.  Let the blanks soak for about 30 minutes.  Clean with dish soap and water.  Make sure they are completely dried when you finish so you don't get strange streaking.
You'll want clean dry blanks before you add Renaissance Wax.
******************************************
These are a great size for stamping!!
Enjoy creating!!!
Please convo me if you have any questions.
Thanks!
