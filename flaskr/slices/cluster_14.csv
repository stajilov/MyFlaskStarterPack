9,Nancy Ann Storybook Doll,"
            Bisque doll with pretty painted face, with movable legs, head and arms. Dressed in a striped pink and white satin dress with a row of lace and an attached underskirt. She wears pantaloons held together with tape. The dress is held closed with a gold snap in the middle of her back. I believe the dress was never removed. She dons a lace hat with pink ribbon tie and bow. She has painted on black shoes.
Her hair seems to be intact. She has a spot on her chin (pen mark?). She is a little dusty from standing on a display shelf for years. She stands 6 inches tall. She has the Storybook stamp on the middle of her back.
No tags or box!        ",15.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1940s

            Great version of Trivial Pursuit game based on the short-lived television game show. The  questions are taken directly from the show. This game has special Preliminary Rounds and Bonus Questions. Like the TV show, if the first player doesn’t answer correctly, you might can jump in with the right answer and earn a scoring wedge. The game ends with the Challenge Round, where everyone plays at once to gain control of the categories – and try to give the most right answers! Game is COMPLETE and the pie pieces haven't been broken from the plastic stem. Box has some shelf wear, but all four corners are intact.

2006,"Vintage Painted Wood Box with Handle, Wood Tote, Wood Tool Box","
            This vintage wood tool box was built by a woman for a man in 1977.  She added an inscription which I painted around which states “Made by Ma for Grody 1977”.  To honor her craftsmanship, I stenciled ‘77’ on one side of the box.  Very Fun Piece.

            Beautiful work of hand cut wooden flowers glued to a darker wood background. I purchased these two at a yard sale in the 1980s, they have been  away in a box in my basement. I tried to Google the artist but I found nothing. Anyway these are very beautiful pieces for wood work lovers.

2241,"Vintage New York city souvenir bracelet. Rockefeller Center, International Airport, Empire State Building, Coney Island, Statue of Liberty!","
            This listing is for a Charming Vintage New York City Souvenir Bracelet.  Vacation, Tourist and old Landmark sites are the theme of the bracelet. The bracelet is gold toned with black hand set imported stones and the graphics are set off in a gold tone.  It is very well done and each plate is special, I enjoy the graphics of each one of them.  The middle plate features the Statue of Liberty surrounded by New York's very tall buildings at that time.  The Empire State building is the first plate dwarfing other buildings in the background.  Coney Island is the second plate, this one is my favorite! It depicts rides at the amusement park and is charming indeed! The fourth notes the International Airport, possibly JFK Airport today but I am not sure. The last plate features The Rockefeller Center.  The detail work is well done on each of the plates. The bracelet is in excellent vintage condition. It has never been removed from the original packaging card, The package says Highlights of New York, City of Wonders, Hand Set Imported Stones. It measures approximately 8 inches long, including the clasp and the charms are about 3/4"". It belonged to my Great Aunt and I don't remember her traveling after 1970, I can't date it but would guess it was from the 1960's. Very classy and well done bracelet that would be a delight to own and wear for any New York City fan or resident!        ",25.00,5.0,"Vintage item

3758,Aristocraft by Superior Vintage White Full Slip 34,"
            Found folded in a box, this Aristocraft slip is a tailored and wearable one.  The only embellishment is the satin stitch along the hemline and the tops of the lightly shirred cups.  The 100% nylon is heavy and a sticker indicates “Shadowproof, with panel”.
Both sides of the embroidered tag are shown.  The 34 short appears to be true to size, if not a little more generous.  Shown modeled on a size 6 - 8 dress form, it is not pinned or affixed in any way.  Perhaps just a tad snug.  
Measurements when laying flat are:

            Foreplay - Original poster from the 1982 Adult film starring Ron Jeremy, Cara Lott and Blair Harris. 
Poster is in good shape & displays well. 
Black dots in the corners are magnets and do not show up on the actual poster! 
My one-sheet posters generally measure 27"" wide x 41"" high, although some may be larger or smaller by an inch or two - if you need an exact measurement, let me know! 
All posters are genuine, theater-used originals, not reproductions, sourced from years of searching and collecting. Posters are as shown, and may have minor wear that is not specifically listed in the description – any significant paper loss, tears or splits, marks, stains or tape residue will be listed to the best of my ability. If you have questions about condition or need a large picture, please ask! 
Posters that have been folded (which is standard for most posters earlier than the 1990's) will be shipped flat; posters that are rolled will be shipped rolled. If you order a lot containing mixed folded and rolled posters and combine shipping, all will be shipped rolled.

4582,Polaroid SX-70 Leather Carrier Case #116,"
            Stop throwing your incredibly expensive SX-70 Polaroid into ill-fitted bags! Tuck it away in thhis 1970s, genuine Polaroid leather carrying case with hand-strap. Leather is a beautiful, soft, warm caramel color. Case flap tucks into a front strap attached with metal rivets. Inner compartment fits an SX-70 Polaroid camera (not included). Could double up as a funky hippie handbag as it's definitely large enough to hold a phone, small notebook, makeup, and other on-the-go items.
The name ""POLAROID"" is embossed lightly into the leather underneath the flap. This case is in great condition with a few marks and scuffs on the exterior. Case is relatively sturdy: leather is 1/8th inch thick, but double-reinforced on the sides and bottom. Inside is beautiful buttery, soft suede - mocha latte tan, clean, no stains. Brass metal rivets show some patina.

4770,REDUCED Cateye Glasses  Black with Rhinestones (arms need replacing) True Vintage,"
            You are looking at a pair of VINTAGE Glasses from 50’s or 60’s.  All the glasses I have up for sale have been used, have some wear and have prescription lenses in them.  MOST of the glasses I sell can have the lenses swapped out with your prescription or dark lenses to turn into sunglasses.  Due to the age of the glasses some of the glasses might not hold up to the stress caused by swapping out the lenses.  It’s been my experience that most WILL hold up.  
So the next time you need a new pair of frames don’t go out and spend 200.00 plus on a new frame, give a old frame a whirl.  Just take your frames to your next eye exam and tell your doctor you want your lenses put in your vintage pair.  
You will be sure to get lots of looks (good looks) when you rock a pair of original vintage frames.
Thank you for your interest.  Please see below details for this particular pair of frames.
COLOR: Black with gold Inlay
BRAND:  Unknown
SIZE: 4 3/4""
DESCRIPTION: Black Plastic Frames with rinestones at temples and gold accent.  NOTE:  The arms need to be replaced.  The right arm is destroyed see above pictures.These have been priced accordingly.  These do not have any lenses in them.  Would be great for a photo shoot.

5620,Vintage Comb Case Florentine Leather Italy Tortoise Shell Comb from AllieEtCie,"
            Vintage Comb Case Florentine Leather Italy Tortoise Shell Comb from AllieEtCie 
This beautiful, vintage, comb case, from Italy, is made of black leather with a gorgeous Florentine white and gold gilding. The design is beautifully intricate, and very elegant. It has a fold-over flap with a black snap closure.  Inside the case is a wonderful, tortoise shell comb, made by Croiniet.  There is a slot for a nail file, but the file is gone.
This vintage comb case measures approximately 5 1/4"" L x 1 1/4"" W.
Condition: The leather feels soft and supple with some wear at the fold-over crease.  There is some loss to the gold gilding, (also at crease), and minor wear on one small spot on the edge of crease. The snap is secure and closes nicely. The comb has all ""teeth"" or ""tines"" intact.  However there are two teeth that are not perfectly straight, creating a small gap between teeth.
This great little comb case would be a perfect partner for this beautiful Florentine compact:

6088,Pearl Grey Ombre Dog Leash,"
            Are you looking for the perfect leash for your furry friend? 
We make 100% cotton rope leashes that are hand dyed and spliced. Leashes are dyed in an ombré style to create a unique look to each one.
There are different thicknesses to have for your furry friend:
1/4"" is perfect for toy sized dogs
3/8"" is perfect for small to medium dogs
1/2"" is perfect for medium to large dogs
5/8"" is perfect for extra large dogs
If your dog is a puller, I would suggest to go a size up. 
Every leash is handmade and unique. Therefore there might be some differences in the color and length from product to product. Please bear in mind that the product pictures are highly exposed to get the sharpest image, so there might be slight differences in the color depending on the light.

This proprietary blend is carefully combined with natural and organic ingredients and free from harsh chemicals that can be harmful to your pet.
I use this product on my boxer and my two chihuahuas. I only feed my dogs raw, organic food and only use natural products on them. These are my precious babies and they deserve the very best.

RE-APPLY every 2-3 days or as needed. Safe enough for daily use. For best results, apply before outdoor activities including walks in the woods and visits to the dog park. 
This blend has been specifically crafted for dogs and is not recommended for use on cats. Cats have very different needs and can have reactions to certain essential oils.
This product not intended to remove existing fleas and ticks. If you suspect your dog has fleas or ticks, consult a professional.

6173,"Santa Hat for Dogs, Dog Santa Hat, Holiday Dog Hat, Christmas Hat for Dogs, Large Breed Dog Hat, Christmas Dog Hat, Santa Dog Hat","
            Looking for a cute pet photo prop for your Christmas pictures?  Or maybe a fun way to let your four legged friend join in on your holiday celebrations?  This traditional colored red and white Santa dog hat makes a perfect Christmas pet accessory - or gift!
But let's be realistic, most dogs don't enjoy wearing hats and shake them off almost immediately.  I took this into account and designed my own *nearly* wiggle proof pattern for this hat.  This unique design makes it much harder for dog to sneak his way out of it before you click the shutter.  And of course treats help too.
---- Wearing Instructions ----
My Santa hat design goes all the way around your dog's head, allowing it to stay securely in place with no pesky ties or straps.  Simply hold the hat with the white part facing you, then slip the hat over your dog's face and up to the forehead.  Gently fit your dog's ears into the ear holes, and you are ready to snap some adorable photos.
---- Measurements and Sizing ----
This hat was designed to fit large breed dogs, such as labradors and golden retrievers.  It fits most dogs up to about 60-70lbs with a head size of 18-20"".  This standard hat size features a 5"" forehead and 4"" ear holes.
To measure your dog's head, measure all the way around your dog's head, in front of the ears.  For video instructions on how to take a measurement, you can visit:

---- Shipping Information -----
My items ship internationally from my smoke free, pet friendly home in Izmir, Turkey. I highly recommend allowing 1 month for delivery time, though most items arrive within 10-15 business days. This allows some room for any unexpected customs or holiday shipping delays.
Express shipping is available upon request for most items, but please message me advance as pricing varies on location.
If you have any questions about the product or shipping, please feel free to contact me.

- Some customers have had success highlighting the numbers on the calendars. Please see the last photo for tips if you'd like to try this. I cannot guarantee the final results. Ballpoint and fine tip gel pens work best.
-----
Info:
- Months are cut in twos. You will need scissors to separate months or to optionally remove the month header.
- This is made to fit your journal, especially if your journal is off white! No more cramps from writing the numbers each time.
- Stickers are printed with black printer ink.

Tips
* Use clean and dry hands when handling stickers.
* Take care when removing stickers from backing. Use the pad of your finger to remove sticker.
* Month names are for reference. You can cut these off or leave them depending on your style.
* Cut off excess sticker.
* Stickers are not kiss cut to allow you to customize sticker.  You can choose to leave or keep the month name.        ",15.00,4.9878,"Handmade item

            Add a little fun to your Kentucky derby party with this simply pretty banner.  It reads ""and they're off..."".  It has the silhouette of a jockey and horse on two flags which anchor each end of the banner.  Each banner is separated by a red rose die cut.  The entire banner is approx 3.5 feet long and banners hang approx 6in.  It is strung on white and brown twine and has plenty of room at each end for hanging.
I also have a variation available for derby themed wedding showers. It has an additional 3 flags and roses.  The flags read ""to the altar"".  The O in ""to"" is a diamond ring.  The colors of roses can be customized.  This version is 18.  Message me for more info :)        ",15.00,4.9655,"Handmade item

I drew these plans up on my computer using a program called ""SketchUp."" I put the work into them and just wanted to sell them and share my work.
It cost me about 80 total when all finished. Price included: wood, box of screws and corrugated metal. My money saving secret in building this was to go to Home Depot, Lowe’s or Menard’s. Find the scrap wood department and lay out your pieces on the floor. [Bring a tape measure and marker] Mark the cut lines, number the pieces [as I have drawn up in my drawings] and they will cut the wood right there for you. When finished, you just take the individually numbers pieces home and screw them together.
Using scrap wood or wood you have in your wood shop, saves LOTS of money!! This is a very quick and easy project and your dog will love you for it. This secret, saves you the mess and setup of your own, the improvement store will do it for you.
Each Dog House has drawings including:
Cover Sheet: Titled ""Savannah Cabannah""
Page 1: Accurately numbered and dimensioned 2x4's
Page 2: Accurately dimensioned 1/4"" plywood sheets [3 in total]
Page 3: Accurately dimensioned corrugated metal
Page 4: Complete layout of all materials needed to construction dog house
Page 5: Completely numbered construction sheet [Comparative to LEGO building instructions]
Page 6: Construction sheet [Comparative to LEGO building instructions]
Page 7: Construction sheet [Comparative to LEGO building instructions]
Page 8: Front and side elevation with dimension for final construction
I would love to hear back from those who have used my plans to build their doghouses. I will make a gallery once I receive your pictures. Please also leave feedback to let others know how our interaction went.
Please specify which you prefer, PDFs, JPEGs or actual printed 8.5""x11"" pages.
Thanks for looking.

It's a special recipe blend that even Mother Nature would approve! 
More about our secret recipe ingredients:
Coconut oil-- is an amazing skin care ingredient.  Soothes eczema, sunburn and psoriasis, and has antiviral and antifungal properties. It is a powerful moisturizer that is beneficial to restoring dry or flaking skin. Coconut oil also helps to delay the occurrence of wrinkles due to its antioxidant properties, known to protect skin cells from damage over time.
Grapeseed oil—may reduce damage to skin cells and enhance the production of collagen and elastin which is important for strong and healthy skin.
Avocado Oil---the antioxidants in avocado oil, particularly vitamins A and E, can help soothe sunburned skin, may reduce itching and inflammation of the skin, and is also beneficial in softening rough, dry, cracked skin.  Avocado oil also contains sterolins, which are natural steroids. They may be effective in boosting collagen production and in treating age spots. 
Organic Sugar- a wonderful natural exfoliant that removes dead skin and cellular build-up, allowing fresh, rejuvenated skin to surface. It's use as a scrub will leave a beautiful glow to your skin, opening the pores of your skin to remove dirt, oils, and bacteria.
To Apply: Take a small quarter sized from the jar and gently massage into skin in desired area. Rinse with warm water and dry with a towel.  For best results, keep out of direct sunlight and keep at room temperature. This product comes in a glass jar so no toxic chemicals from plastic will leach into your product. 
As with any skin product always test a small area first to ensure no allergies.

8386,Stained glass cactus! Great gift for the plant or succulent lover!,"
            No green thumb needed for these great stained glass cacti! Already potted for you also!
I used a mix of green glasses to create these adorable mini cactus. They are potted in mini terracotta pots and ready to bring some color wherever you place them! Each cactus pot is finished off with loose pebbles.
This listing is for single cacti, but I have the set of 6 listed here: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/495314861/set-of-6-stained-glass-cactus-great-gift
and the price reflects buy 5, get the 6th one FREE!
Made in the Tiffany style of copper foil. After lovingly assembling the hand-cut, foiled and soldered glass, I polish with wax for a beautiful finish. The cactus have a silver finish. The cactus are inserted into florist foam in a small terracotta pot, then finished with pebbles/gravel, glued down, to top them off.
The first picture has the letters A-F corresponding with each cactus. Please let me know which you'd like when ordering. Otherwise I'll pick one of these beauties for you!
The cactus range in height from 3-4 inches. The base of the pot is roughly 1 inch wide, while the top is roughly 1.75 inches wide. The window sill I have them sitting on in the main picture is 2 inches wide, and they fit with no problem.
All my pieces are made with love and happiness!
As these are handmade, there may be slight variations in each.

PROTECTING YOUR GLASS PIECE FROM BREAKING:
 Keeping your pipe stored in a case or pipe bag after it has cooled down and not in use is a great way to help prevent future breaks. :) 
 Try not to empty your ashes out by tapping your glass piece on a ashtray. I know a lot of people get in the habit of tapping their pipe on a ashtray which can cause small fractures in the glass and over time of it heating up and cooling down eventually can cause it to break.
 Using a poker or a pipe cleaner is a more cautious way of empting out and cleaning your pipe after use. ;)
Color Changing Glass Pipes:
In the early 1980’s glass artists began experimenting with silver and gold fuming processes in an effort to change the characteristics of Glass Pipes. What was discovered was that a thin layer of pure gold and/or silver applied to the inside or the outside of the glass pipe created a unique phenomenon once tobacco was introduced to the product. The tobacco particulate, combined with the precious metals refracted the light much like a prism, causing the pipe to change colors. Additionally, different tobaccos produced different hues insuring completely unique Glass Pipes based on individual usage.
Flavor Enhancing:
Glass tobacco pipes were developed to provide a pure smoking experience by eliminating the competing tastes of metal, wood and other porous or burnable materials, in effect isolating the natural flavor of the tobacco. Whether enjoying a beautiful Glass Hand Pipe, Bubbler or a Glass One Hitter you can be assured that glass will not impart any undesirable flavors or tastes. Solar Storm Creations Glass’s line of traditional tobacco accessories is designed specifically for the tobacco connoisseur.        ",15.00,4.9479,"Handmade item

            Authentic Golden Grade Natural Altai Shilajit Premium Resin Pure Mumio
Although still fairly unknown in the Western Hemisphere, shilajit (pronounced shi-lah-jeet) has held a firm and beloved place for more than 5,000 years in Indian medicinal texts. Today, it is regarded as the most essential natural substance of Ayurveda, which is the traditional Indian health care system. In its pure form, shilajit is a mineral deposit found in the mountains of India, Russia, and East Asia. Typically black in color, this tar-like resin or “stone oil” oozes from the mountain rocks and is overflowing with beneficial nutrients and minerals in ionic form.
Shilajit is known for the following unique properties that can improve your health:
    Potent nutrients such as antioxidants, trace minerals, and humic and fulvic acid*
    Rich in A, B, and C vitamins*
    Maintains metabolism and superfine rejuvenating effect may slow results of aging*
    Balances electrolytes and burns excess fat*
    Stimulates energy and improves the immune system*
    Enhances mental performance and know to be a powerful aphrodisiac*
The Power of Pure Shilajit
Although many commercial sellers advertise authentic shilajit, few sell the most potent from which the stream of benefits flow. Sayan offers shilajit which is made from 100% pure shilajit resin, packed with an optimal amount of minerals and trace elements to help your body function at its finest. The presence of fulvic acid in shilajit helps your body naturally detoxes harmful substances and absorbs minerals at a cellular level, enhancing your capacity for benefiting from all shilajit has to offer.*

How to Take Shilajit – Three Effective Methods for Enhanced Health
For consumption, we recommend you take a pea-sized portion once a day with a meal. To consume, simply dissolve in hot, non-chlorinated water, tea or warm milk and drink. Due to its strong taste, we suggest adding sweetener.
You can also apply the shilajit as an external rinse. For this method of application, dissolve half a teaspoon of shilajit in 200ml of warm water. Use a cleansing tonic for your skin, body, or hair to promote healthy cellular growth.
As a final route of application, you can use the shilajit as a mask or compress. Dissolve 1 tablespoon in 50 ml of warm water until it becomes a homogenous substance. Rub it on achy muscles and joints to reduce pain or use as a compress by affixing to the affected area with a bandage for two hours. Rinse off after use.
For maximum benefits, we highly recommend you take shilajit for 6-8 weeks period at a time, four times per year.
Size: each jar has 3.5 oz (100 grams) of pure high quality shilajit resin.
If you are pregnant, breastfeeding or under a doctor’s care for any health condition you should consult with your physician prior taking shilajit.

Ekzema & Psoriasis Remedy
***New impproved formula! bigger container!
What people said about our Ekzema & Psoriasis Salve
""...works exceptionally well at keeping skin moisturized and clearing up psoriasis from psoriatic arthritis. Cannot recommend this product enough""
""Absolutely phenomenal!! In one night my mother,who has severe psoriasis, saw dramatic results.  Cannot say enough about how happy I am with this purchase.""
  Ekzema and Psoriasis are tricky skin disorders and most of the time they are treated with cortison. To be honest I don't think cortison is the answer to a problem. There are too many side effects and I had never been a huge fan of chemistry!!! 
   So we started working on a salve... After about a year of experimenting we came to the perfecet recipe!!! A combination of ingredients that can relief from the symptoms of ekzema and psoriasis. Avocado oil, Sesame oil, Hemp Seed Oil, Calendula oil, Beeswax, Propolis and essential oils.
• Avocado oil: Avocado oil, with its strong moisturizing properties that penetrate deep into the skin, has been shown to be effective for many skin conditions such as acne and eczema as well as psoriasis. It also helps the skin to regenerate new cells which improves the quality of the skin.
• Sesame oil has healing properties when it comes to ekzema and psoriasis and protects the skin from the sun, which is important when you suffer from such skin disorders. 
• Calendula oil is a very soothing oil with anti-inflamatory properties. 
• Hemp Seed Oil: Omega-3 fatty acids residing in hemp oil can improve cell membrane, hydrate skin cells and wipe accumulated dead cells. Linoleic acid packed in hemp oil is converted to gamma linoleic acid in your body, which helps to reduce inflammation and balances the hormones. Both omega 3 & 6 fatty acids are known for their exceptional benefits for healthy skin. They lock the moisture under the skin and relieve from itching.
Study claims that cannabinoids helps to inhibit rapid growth of skin cells and reduce inflammation. Because of its anti-inflammatory ability, hemp seed oil can effectively slow down the cell generation cycle.
• Propolis is known for being a natural antibiotic and is truly remarkable with skin problems. 
• The essential oils used here have great anti-inflamatory, anti-bacterial, healing and soothing properties.
Our salve can calm down the symptoms and improve skin, while it will reduce itchiness and inflamations and it is probably better than using cortison or other chemical products that offer the same results.
Ingredients: Beeswax, Calendula Oil, Hemp Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Sesame Oil, Propolis, Bergamot Essential Oil, Lavender Essential Oil, Myrrh Essential Oil, Incense Essential Oil 
Weight: 1.70 oz (50ml) or 2.53 oz (75ml)
Use: Apply 3 times a day on the affected area.
NOTE: This is NOT a CURE but it offers relief from the symptoms of ekzema and psoriasis.
We only use unrefined oils and butters. If you have any allergies please let us know and we could find a solution.

9099,Perpetual calendar - wooden perpetual calendar - wood calendar - Christmas gift - moon phase calendar - nature gift - gift for kids - home,"
            Children thrive on rhythm. They also love to discover and learn. This calendar serves all those purposes. Every morning, visually describe how the day is unfolding and get a beautiful start... while also intuitively answering why the day is the way it is! At the end of the day, set the moon phase hand while gazing at the night sky and say good night to the day.
What sets this perpetual calendar apart?
=================================
It not only provides a beautiful place to organize all the information but it satisfies the inate urges of the child to always be curious and ask why. My daughter's favorite phrase is ""but why?..."". Well, here it is...
The season is autumn now. But why?....  Do you see the position of the Earth with respect to the Sun... This is where we live (point it out) and as we are moving away from the Sun... 
This calendar doesn't just say what, but also in a visual and intuitive way points to the ""why"". This gives an excellent starting point to encourage conversations about our Earth, the moon, weather, seasons and a lot more.
This beautiful wooden perpetual calendar doubles as a home decor!
Sections of this beautiful wooden calendar
=====================================
There are 6 sections to this perpetual calendar -
1) A temperature section. This sliding (magnetic) pointer sets the days' temperature and lets them choose their own clothing to dress for the day. When they set the pointer, it becomes much easier to persuade them to wear weather appropriate clothing (most of the time they make this decision themselves without prompting)
2) A hanging date section. By default this calendar comes with a chalkboard tile. You can write the date or draw something fun. Have a great picture of the activity you are going to do today? Switch the tile out and hand your picture! You also have the option of adding 16 two sided tiles with dates painted on them.
3) Weather section. Similar to the temperature section, helps them prepare for the day.
4) Days of the week section. 7 days wheel with a rotating hand to set the day. By default it is painted in rainbow colors. You can choose to leave it unpainted or rainbow colors or in Waldorf color of the days.
5) Moon phase wheel. Clearly depicts the Earth and the moon relationship and how the moon looks like in each phase and why.
6) Seasons and months section. Has the Sun and the Earth in 4 positions around the Sun, 4 seasons, season appropriate nature painted beautifully and the months engraved.
Size
=======
22"" long, 9"" wide and 0.5"" deep. Yes it is a great sized calendar! 
********Note: The calendar will be trimmed off at the border, so there won't be the extra space outside border, if you want extra space, please let me know.*********
Materials
============
Maple. Beautiful hardwood maple. The rotating hands and the sliding pointers are cherry, giving a great contrast.
The details are engraved and painted using non-toxic water colors.
The calendar is finished with food grade linseed oil to bring the beauty of the wood.
Packaging
=========
This calendar comes beautifully wrapped in tissue paper and packed securely in a box, ready to be gifted. If you want me to add a gift note, please leave your note in the ""notes to seller"" section during checkout.i        ",139.00,5.0,"Handmade item

9171,Handcrafted redwood dreidels,"
            About us:
I am excited to re-launch a family business,  We sell hand-crafted dreidels made from salvaged and scrap redwood.  Each letter is individually burned.  The dreidels are hand-sanded and sealed with non-toxic linseed oil and beeswax.  Variations in color and wood grain contribute to the beauty.  .  
I grew up in Berkeley, California and now live in Alameda, an island in the SF Bay.   My mom originally started this business in 1974, after searching high and low for something other than cheap plastic dreidels.   She enlisted some friends to help design, make and sell traditional wooden dreidels.
I have great memories of selling dreidels with my mom.   In addition to setting up shop at temple craft fairs around the Bay Area, she was a vendor on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley – we would get up early, participate in the lottery for spaces, set up the booth.  In those days, many people didn’t know what a dreidel was, but my mom had a great sales pitch, and a knack for selling to people from all cultures.   My mom was a librarian at UC Berkeley, so she would frequently run into colleagues and friends.   (Side note -- Telegraph Avenue vendors would often trade their goods – which is how I ended up with most of my jewelry in high school, including liquid silver necklaces with turquoise or tiger’s eye.  And feather earrings, which apparently are back in style.)
As my mom and her partners became busier and busier with family and careers, the business became dormant.   
Still, whenever a friend happened to see one of the “first generation” dreidels, they would ask where I got it.   And I would tell the story of my mom and the Dreidel Factory, and explain that they weren’t for sale anymore. And after hearing myself tell the story over and over, year after year, I realized there was still a real interest in quality handmade dreidels.  So I decided to re-launch the family business (my day job is in biomedical informatics, using information science to analyze and process medical terminology for use in computer applications).  
I look forward to introducing our hand-crafted, locally-made product to a new generation.        ",15.00,5.0,"Handmade item

9364,Negan's Bat - Lucille - TWD - Authentic Replica - Cosplay,"
            This is an authentic representation of Negan's bat Lucille from The Walking Dead.  No ones Man Cave, Home Bar, Living Room or Bathroom is complete without this replica bat.  The bat is made of real wood and stained to look identical to the bat on the show.  The barbed wire is wrapped to replicate the McFarlane toy bat.  The toy bat claims to be an exact replication of Lucille on TWD.  The barbed wire is real and sharp, so please be careful.  This isn't a toy.  It's the real deal.  Completely handmade.  Extra time and care is put into each and every bat.  Every bat includes a vertical mount to hang it on your wall.  Does not come with an option for blood splatter (I prefer a clean Lucille).
UPS Ground Shipping within the USA (Merica)
All International orders add 75 (shipping times are subject to change)
Cancelled orders are subject to a restocking fee.  This fee is calculated by the amount that ETSY charges me for issuing the refund. (yes sellers get charged for that) I apologize, but... come on, it's only fair.

Your raven-post box will then be wrapped with a natural raffia ribbon and crowned with a single raven feather.  Scrolls are shipped via USPS first class mail....faster than a raven and much more trackable.  The golden dragon egg pictured in the listing can also be included as a keepsake for an additional 9.  Just select it at check out along with your choice of wax seal. 
**Please note that your scroll will be produced via printer using calligraphy font...they are not hand written.  You will thank me if you ever see my handwriting.

3.  The shipping address you enter for your order is where your message will be sent.  Be sure to list the recipient’s address if you’d like it sent directly to them.  
PROCESSING & SHIPPING:
Processing time is one to three rises of the sun.  Processing time does not include USPS shipping speed which is generally 2 to 5 days. Should you need your scroll to arrive swifter than swift, please contact me regarding upgrading your first class USPS service to priority 2 day mail.

I am a huge GoT nerd that delights in making these scrolls so if I can expedite your scroll without cost, I am happy to do so at no additional charge.  Additional expedited mailing charges and/or rush fees may apply depending on my actual shipping cost.
FAQ:
1.	What are my message options?   
Your options are only limited by your own imagination…message text is 100% custom…you draft the text and I will produce it exactly as you’ve written it.  Please keep text to a maximum of 500 words.
2.	What size will my raven-post message be?  
Messages have a max measurement of  6.5” x 10”.  Your scroll will be sized for maximum aesthetic effect so size will be based on the number of characters you have in your message.
3.   How do I order multiple scrolls to be sent to different addresses?
You can place separate orders....1 for each ship to address.  OR you can place one order to be shipped to you and mail them to your recipients.
4.  Can I customize the scroll and/or box?
Yes, yes, yes!  I love customization requests....Etsy shoppers are incredibly creative....your ideas help my shop and my products evolve. Email me with your idea and I will do my best to make it happen.        ",15.00,4.9538,"Handmade item

10013,Moku Hanga Playing Cards,"
            The Original Moku Hanga Inspired Playing Card.
The Moku Hanga Inspired Playing Cards Deck is an original set of playing cards designed by À Vol d'Oiseau. It melds the traditional aesthetics of Japanese style woodblock printing with a modern flare inspired by our interests in modern Japanese manga and western comics. The art is printed on 310 gsm linen playing cards.
The Joker cards represent Yôkai, monsters from the traditional Japanese folk tales. The one on the right is a Oni (鬼), a demon known for being invincible. The one on the left is Harionago (針女子). She comes from the Japanese prefecture of Ehime on Shikoku island. She is famous for her beauty and ensnaring men with her hair.

10090,Fab Foot Stretcher,"
            The Fab Foot Stretcher was designed and is manufactured by Sage, a 13 year-old dancer. Dancers, gymnasts, figure skaters and swimmers know that flexibility and strengthening their arches is fundamental to correct positioning of their feet. 
Sage wanted to create a stretcher that not only gave her a consistently good stretch, but one that didn’t cause the heel pain that most stretchers do, was smaller in size, and of course she wanted it to reflect her personality by allowing her to choose what pattern she wanted; all while not paying the 60-100 that the majority of stretchers cost.
Sage met all of these goals and came away with a product that is able to achieve the same stretch as the 100 foot stretchers, more comfortably, and at a fraction of the cost! In fact, for less than the cost of one of the current choices of stretchers available, you could own two and stretch both feet at the same time! The Fab Foot Stretcher:
Is a specially designed arch stretcher made to increase flexibility in your arch.
Comes in many patterns
Has a wooden base and padded area for heel 
Includes a Theraband to increase stretch. 
Fab Foot Stretcher makes every effort to have each item shipped within 72 hours of order. Each is handmade at the time of your order by Sage, an 8th grader and dancer. So sometimes a math test or competition day comes first. Thanks for supporting her dreams and we wish the best for yours as well!
Always warm up foot before use and do not overuse. 
*Fab Foot Stretcher is not liable for any injury related to its use.        ",15.00,5.0,"Handmade item

10113,Marble maze - wooden marble run - special needs toy- portable marble toy - Christmas gift - gift for kids - montessori toys - marble race,"
            A fun twist to the old fashion marble maze toy - reconfigurable marble maze. Want a toy that is open ended, provides endless hours of fun, develops fine motor skills and develops problem solving skills? This is it!
This marble maze is as easy as you'd like or as challenging as you can take! The tiles are removable and you can arrange it however you like. This maze is so much fun and so so relaxing! I find myself arranging and rearranging the tiles over and over again. It is hard to put down even for adults!
Size
==========
I have 2 options 16 tiles (4x4 tile arrangement) and 36 tiles (6x6 tile arrangement). Each tile is 1.5"" square and each arrangement comes with its own tray. The size of the 4x4 arrangement including the tray is 7""x7"", the size of the 6x6 arrangement including the tray is 10""x10"".
 Comes with 3 colored 3/8"" balls that are removable (colored red, yellow and green by default but can be customized to your choice).
MATERIALS
==============
These are made of hardwood maple (please note that the wood used to make the maze in the picture had some pretty dark sections. Usually, maple is buttery white and won't have the two tone shown in the picture). 
Each piece of the maze is sanded smooth for the safety of little hands. This wooden marble maze is finished using food grade linseed oil to bring the grain and the beauty of the wood. 
PACKAGING NOTES
====================
The maze will arrive in a wooden tray, neatly wrapped in tissue... ideal for storing, transporting and gifting. I will be happy to include a card or a note if you are sending it directly to the recipient. Just leave the note in the ""note to seller"" section or shoot me a message!

10610,"Ukulele Strap- Adjustable neck style sling strap, Red, White tribal pattern woven trim, narrow width, hook attachment","
            This is an adjustable length sling style strap for ukuleles, guitarleles or any kind of ""lele"" or other small string instrument! No need for a strap button on the instrument! The ribbon is a narrow 3/4"" inch wide  wonderful ikat woven ribbon.
This is a sort of cranberry red with white, blue and yellow details,  ""X"" tribal pattern on a black background. This strap is made from a modern, lightweight fabric trim and is a little more narrow than my other straps. Tribal style pattern shows on both sides very nicely, similar to my vintage guitar straps!
The strap is worn around the neck and has an adjustable plastic slide to control the length, and a secure plastic J hook at the end to slip into the sound hole of the instrument. A sling style neck strap will hold your instrument safely and won't damp the sound! Will not scratch or damage your instrument either- no metal parts, just soft fabric and a rounded plastic hook and slider.
**Definitely order the small size hook for soprano, and maybe concert sizes. Small hook will also work fine for larger sizes. Wide style hook is best for tenor or larger instruments. There is not enough clearance between the high string and sound hole on smaller instruments for the wide hook**
Average length fits most people, but let me know if you need something longer or shorter.        ",15.00,4.8919,"Handmade item

11268,Ladies Claddagh Corrib Claddagh Wedding Band R126-S,"
            Corrib Claddagh Band in Sterling Silver.
As Lough Corrib Spills out into Galway Bay along the Corrib river it passes the ancient village of Claddagh.It was here that the Original Claddagh Ring was first created by Richard Joyce in The 17th Century.
The history of the Claddagh ring dates back to the early 16th century, to the village of Claddagh in Co. Galway. Legend is that a fishing boat from the village was captured by pirates and the crew taken. Richard Joyce was to have been married that week but as one of the captured crew, he was sold into slavery where he learned the art of goldsmithing. He was released many years later and returned home to find the love of his heart. She too had waited for him and he made her a ring. The heart stands for love, the hands for friendship and the crown for loyalty. The Claddagh ring has become very popular all over the world, worn by all as a symbol of friendship, love and loyalty. Wearing the ring with the heart pointing away from your own heart denotes that you are ""available"" but worn with the heart pointing towards your own heart, means that you are ""taken""!
The Corrib Claddagh brings new light to this ancient symbol of Love,Loyalty and Friendship. 
THIS RING IS: 6.5mm Wide
If you would like to order more than one ring size or metal choice in a particular design, the easiest way to proceed would be to order each ring separately. 
It is very important to choose the correct ring size when ordering, as each ring is custom made for you. In some cases, a ring with a continuous pattern is not re-sizable. If you choose the wrong size, we will be delighted to exchange your order for the correct size, but the exchange will be subject to a restocking fee.
If you are not sure of your finger size, the best suggestion we have is that you visit your local jewelry store to be professionally measured. Jewelers use steel ring sizers that come in narrow or wide widths. Keep in mind that the width of the ring you are ordering will affect what size you need - narrower rings will be a slightly smaller size than a wider ring on the same finger. This is especially important when ordering wedding rings or wide bands. In this case, make sure your jeweler uses his wider band sizers which are normally 6 mm or so in width. Remember also that your finger size is usually different for each hand, whatever hand you write with is probably a little larger. 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to Contact Us as we would be more than happy to assist!        ",77.73,5.0,"Handmade item

            Hello and congratulations!
At SplashOfSilver we LOVE what we do! Since your invitations will set the tone for your entire wedding, we are dedicated to creating high-quality stationery that is unique and beautiful for your big day! We are very pleased to meet you, and we are looking forward to working with you. 
Please be sure to window shop before officially deciding on a particular design, as we have many suites to choose from in our shop! We do quite a bit of custom work as well, so if you do not see what you are looking for, feel free to contact us. 
---- S A M P L E S ----
Wording and colors on the samples cannot be customized. Sample sets are printed as shown in the pictures above but are customizable once you place your print order. 
To purchase a printed sample, choose “Sample – Printed” from the drop down menu under Style at the top right hand side of the listing.

You can choose how many digital pieces you would like to purchase from a suite. The different buying choices for the digital files can be found in the drop down menu under Style at the top right hand side of the listing. If you would like to purchase more pieces than what is shown, please message us. 
The digital option is perfect for you if you would rather cut costs by doing the printing yourself at home, or if you would rather find your own printing company of choice. With the digital option, you can put all of your information & requests into the ""notes to seller"" section at checkout. We actually customize and edit the pieces for you – you WILL NOT be receiving an instant download. You will receive the first digital proofs via email within 2-5 business days (M-F) of purchase. One round of revisions and free color changes are included with every digital order.

15017,Roving Fiber Top Wool Falkland Gradient ARCADIA Phatfiber Feature April 4 oz Easy Spin Felt Knit Weave Craft Purple Green Blue,"
            ARCADIA is a gorgeous gradient of green to purple to deep blue.  It's the Phatfiber Feature for April's Golden Age Box.   
This is handpainted and I allow the colors to marry a bit so each braid can be a little different, but when they are ordered together, they will be from the same dye lot - still because these are handmade no two will ever be exactly alike.  
This preparation is easy to spin and a little softer than Columbia.

15024,Standard Turkish Spindle 3D Printed,"
            The original 3D Printed Turkish Spindle!
7"" shaft
5"" arms
Each spindle has 2 arms and 1 shaft.  Mix and match colors for a truly personalized spindle.       
The ""Glow White"" is glow in the dark, it's a shiny pearly white.
The standard spindles weigh between 1.0 and 1.2 ounce.      
Spindles are made from PLA.  There is a heat warning.  You do not need to be worried about being outside or anything like that with PLA. Most PLA is stable to around 140 degrees (there may be slight variance due to different colors and materials) before it gets soft but a car can exceed these temperatures very quickly, even on cooler days the car can exceed 100 degrees inside. The seats and dashboards will be hotter yet from what I have read they typically run about 50 degrees hotter. On a sunny day your dashboard and seats can reach over 180 degrees. What we generally say is if it is comfortable for you, it is comfortable for your spindle.
**A NEW OPTION is to have a shaft molded from ABS.  These new shafts are smoother and stronger!  The final picture in the line up shows some of  the solid color choices I have.  This is subject to change and frequently does!  From left to right, they are; 
Yellow
Sparkle Red
Fluorescent Blue (out of stock)
Pink
Purple (out of stock)
Black
Green (out of stock)
Eggplant
Not shown but available are multis, which are a swirling mix of different colors.  
**The drop down menus allow you to choose PLA color choice and Shaft.  PLEASE INDICATE in the note to seller box if you want both arms the same PLA color or if you want different colors.  The Shaft option is for you to choose whether you want a printed from PLA shaft in the same color options as the arms shown above, or if you want a shaft molded from ABS plastic.  You can choose your own color from the ABS colors shown in the above picture or you can have me choose either one of those solids or a multi.
A typical note would be something like this;
Main arm candy apple red
second arm shiny neon green
Shaft PLA lemon yellow**
**If you are outside of the US, please note that once I send your package, it may take between 10 days and 2 months to arrive.  This is based on the actual times we have seen for past shipments.**        ",15.00,4.976,"Handmade Supply

            Bisque mini mold set of 4 in the following approximate sizes (one of each size):
1 1/2” wide x 3/4 “ tall
1 1/4” wide x 9/16” tall 
7/8” wide x 3/8” tall
5/16” wide x 5/16” tall 
Re-usable, re-positionable. The first picture is of the molds, the next picture is an example of how they can be positioned in the kiln. The last three pictures are examples of a poppy, butterfly, and finally a candy dish.  All fused glass pieces were formed using mini-molds, the options are truly endless!
Did I mention how modular the mini molds are?  Modular equals freedom to place more pieces in the kiln and avoid extra firings. Molds taking up extra space are a thing of the past. Mini molds are fired ceramic bisque and can be used over and over without deterioration of the mold.  Kiln wash must be applied before use.  Kiln wash can be applied via brush or spray.  
Instructions with pictures will be sent via email, please be certain to include your email address with a payment note. 
Mini Molds are created by hand in my studio and are not available through other suppliers.  Due to their handmade nature there may be slight size differences.  We try to have all orders shipped within 3 days but during high demand it could take up to a week.        ",19.00,5.0,"Handmade Supply

            This listing is for the DECAL ONLY for a DIY project of the pictured photo in an 11x14 Frame with glass. You WILL NOT receive the picture frame in this listing, but only the DECAL.
This is a GREAT Mother-in-law gift from her daughter in law and son. You can completely customize! If you purchase the DECAL as shown, you will receive:
1. a decal with the main poem in one color of your choice in the size: approx. 10.5""Hx9.25""W 
2. a decal with the title ""Our Mother"" and the arrow at the bottom in a one color of your choice.
****Please specify in NOTES TO SELLER:
Vinyl Color choices (choose 1 or 2-as pictured).  The photo is done so that the wall color shows through. It's just the glass, so choose colors that will coordinate well with your wall unless you will put your DECAL on a photo with a backing and then you can coordinate your DECAL color with the backing. 
*******IMPORTANT***********
This decal will come to apply to the front of the glass or to a backing paper or other smooth surface. If you want it to be in reverse to apply to the back of the glass, you'll need to specify that to me.

16124,Shiny silicone puffy heart resin mould,"
            Super shiny puffy heart mould for use with resin. Each cavity is approximately 2 by 2 inches.
****Unfortunately I have had to raise the price of this mould as there has been a significant rise in the price I buy them for. My apologies but there is nothing I can do about this.*****
Photos of resin pieces to show scale and finish only.
I do not recommend using 10 minute resin with this mould as it is more corrosive than clear resin and may damage the silicone or fuse to it. 
Like any shiny mould this will dull with time after many uses, a simple polish of the final piece will return the shine.
Silicone moulds attract dust easily and leftover glitter may stick to them. Due to this I clean my moulds before every use by patting them with the sticky side of a piece of tape until they are super shiny and perfect again.
 
Free standard first class postage within the UK is included in the price. If you want recorded postage let me know but you will have to pay more. Lost packages are not my responsibility. Sorry.
For overseas postage prices that aren't listed below please get in touch, all postage prices listed are untracked. Tracked postage can be organised at an extra cost.
Please do not hesitate to contact me with any queries or questions.
Finally, and most importantly, I hope you love this mould as much as I do! :)        ",11.28,5.0,"Craft type: Candy making, Jewelry making, Soap making & bath

16135,"MASSAGE BAR Mold, 4 - 4.5 oz cavities, Silicone, TWH Exclusive","
            *This listing is for one mold. There are two molds in the picture just to show both sides. 
Massage Bar Mold Detail:
Each of the 4 cavities holds 4.5 oz of water to the rim. Filling it less full still gives a nice massage bar, but allows you to scale the bar size as you prefer between 3 oz and 4.5 oz. The cavities are 3 1/4"" long, 2- 1/4"" wide and 1 -3/4"" deep. You can fill them as shallow as 1 -1/4"" and still have a nice bar if you prefer a lighter weight product.
The massage nubs are sturdy, thick & properly tapered for easy unmolding. A cp soap recipe that is water discounted or contains sodium lactate is preferred for easy unmolding. You can also pop the mold into the freezer to firm up soft soap recipes before you unmold. You can use this mold for melt & pour & lotion bars as well. 
A video that shows unmolding soap made with the massage bar mold: 
https://youtu.be/fqzBVObQ8Uo
The mold die is embedded with our logo & website address & we had them made in our company color- turquoise! We are the only retailer that offers this mold. (Logo will not show on product- it's on the outside of the mold.)

16408,37.5% OFF Crochet Pattern Bundle - 3 Sets of 3 Stacking Baskets - Crochet PDF Instant Download Instructions File by JaKiGu,"
            Get all three of JaKiGu's  stacking crochet basket patterns from the Jute and Cotton Series at a 37.5% discount!
This crochet pattern bundle consists of three (3) separate PDF files: Round Jute and Cotton Stacking Baskets, Square Jute and Cotton Stacking Baskets, and Round Lace Jute and Cotton Stacking Baskets. 
JaKiGu crochet patterns are comprehensive (20, 25, and 20 pages respectively), and contain detailed instructions, illustrative photos, helpful tips, photo tutorials, and a summary of crochet skills needed for this project.
PATTERN OVERVIEW
These patterns are written in standard American terms. Collectively, they contain two non-standard stitches, which are explained in great detail both in words and pictures. 
SKILL LEVEL
Though I do not discourage anyone from attempting to crochet these baskets, the round pattern will be best suited for an intermediate crocheter with confidence crocheting basic crochet stitches, and with variety of materials. The square baskets pattern and the lace baskets patterns would be best suited for a very experieced crocheter. Ideally, this will not be your first crochet project. If you have never worked with jute before, please be prepared to be working with a fiber much stiffer and rougher than traditional crochet yarns.
MATERIALS
3-ply 3 mm jute; 4-ply, medium weight cotton*
5.5 mm and 11.5 mm hooks
*Specific brands, weights, and quantities of jute and cotton are included in each instructional booklet, as are the tips on finding the best alternatives if you can't source the suggested materials.

16863,Sideways Anchor Ring in Gold or Sterling Silver - Sideways Anchor Ring With Cross - Horizontal Anchor Ring - Yellow Gold or Rose Gold,"
            Dainty anchor ring in silver with sideways cross. The anchor was considered to be religious jewelry for 100s of years. Also because of the great importance in navigation, was regarded in ancient times as a symbol of safety. The Christians, therefore, in adopting the anchor as a symbol of hope in future existence, merely gave a new and higher signification to a familiar emblem.

Care for my Sterling Silver Jewelry: All of my sliver jewelry is made with sterling silver and sterling silver filled wire. It will not turn your finger green like plated type jewelry does but it will become dingy with wear and just being exposed to air. My jewelry can be cleaned with a sterling silver type cleaner. You can also use a little toothpaste and a soft tissue to have it looking brand new again! If you have any questions about the care of your new jewelry, please send me a message!
Metal allergy information: All my jewelry is made with sterling silver wire, sterling silver filled wire, and 14k gold filled wire. Some of charms and other pieces are made with other added metals. If you have a metal allergy and have any questions please let me know!        ",15.00,4.8393,"Handmade item

17056,Choice of TWO RINGS for 15 dollars! Wirewrapped healing crystal rings!,"
            READ THE DESCRIPTION PLEASE :)
2 for 15 Hand made wire wrapped healing crystal rings! Shown here in the first picture on the middle finger from top to bottom we have Red Agate in gold, Garnet in silver, Opalite in gold, Aventurine in copper, and Tigers Eye in gold. On the Index finger from top to bottom we have Hematite in copper, Moonstone in copper, Yellow Jade in silver, Turquoise in copper, Amethyst in copper, and Rose Quartz in gold!
•••These will all have to be custom made since we will need your ring size. But you can also mix and match the stones with wires! Just let us know what stone, what color wire, and what size when placing your order!***
*PLEASE READ* You can only select one ring from the drop down options so you will need to write what stone type, what wire color, and what size you would like your SECOND ring to be in the 'note to seller' section when placing order. If you have any questions do not hesitate to message us!
No two crystals are the same! Your ring will not be exactly what is pictured!! The crystals are approximately 8 mm, with the moonstone being a little smaller. The rings above are sizes 6-8. *If you wear a larger ring size the rings will look smaller on your fingers* All of our crystals are real and authentic, we really believe in the power of healing crystals & their energies so we would never sell crystals that weren't real. Opalite is the exception since this is a man made stone, but it still possesses healing properties & it's beautiful so we still offer it! Thank you :) 
***If you do not let us know what you would like your second ring to be when purchasing we will send you a ring of our choice in the same size that you ordered***

The opal stone cap is 5mm
1 (One) Opal stone barbell per order
Choose Your Barbell Length:
- 3/8"" (10mm) 
- 5/16"" (8mm)
A stunning opal lip or cartilage barbell comes in your choice of opal stone color.  The opal cap screws INTO the internally threaded (hollow) barbell. The bottom most part of the barbell is flat.
Due to the contrast and color differences in computer monitors, the color of the opal in person may seem a little lighter/darker/slightly different hue but it will be the color of your choice.  These pictures are taken outside in natural lighting as well as indoors to show the difference lighting can have on your opals.
These can be used in a variety of piercing sites, but of course only in spots that are 3/8"" or 5/16"" thick. Ive seen these used in philtrum , cartilage , snake bites , etc.  Body Jewelry is not returnable for sanitation and safety reasons but you can check your sizes on the websites posted on the bottom of my policies page.

Please send me a note at checkout if you would like the clear sealer on your copper anklet.

Copper is widely believed to have a healing quality(bonus!). This copper anklet  is a sturdy, simple band of round copper that is bendable so you can make slight adjustments to make sure it fits your individual anklet just right :) 
This anklet has been fire heated, hand hammered and polished for a gorgeous bright shiny and rustic beauty. This anklet can get wet, sandy, sweaty and it will be just fine:) 
This is simple and natural jewelry. This anklet is easy to wear every day. This item is not fragile and will last over time. You will be able to wear this anklet for years to come and remember the happy day you first got it!
**The anklet is made to your specified size. Please measure around your ankle (where you would like to wear the anklet )and select your measurement during checkout. Please select your actual measurement and not a larger measurement, I can figure out the size your anklet should be based on your actual ankle measurement :)
This copper anklet will look shiny right out of package and develop a unique patina over time as yours takes on its own personal character or you can keep it shiny by rubbing the anklet with a little salt on a lemon slice and polishing with a soft cloth. ***I can apply a clear sealer to your anklet to prevent it from the patina process and to protect its brilliant glow. Please send me a note at checkout if you would like your anklet with clear sealer ( no extra charge).
*** The anklet is rigid and strong but also a bit flexible for adjustment and so you can take it on and off and not worry about it slipping from your ankle when you’re wearing it. 
***The copper anklet is also available in a 1/8 inch width which is slightly thicker but not as flexible. 
I make these  anklets to your size as requested.  These anklets match my copper bracelets listed seperatley.
I sell copper jewelry for a reasonable price because I see it so expensive other places. I really do not like paying for overpriced things and I don't think anyone else does either. I purchase my copper at a great price and I really enjoy making jewelry. So I offer a great price forward to anyone who would like a beautiful solid copper anklet.
It is believed by some that copper has a healing quality, what a bonus for this anklet; Copper is considered a natural noninvasive pain relief aid. Copper jewelry  has a long history of use for helping with wrist and hand joint problems such as Arthritis, Carpal Tunnel, RSI, and Tendonitis, offering many people considerable pain relief.
Thank you for visiting my shop :)

            ***PLEASE Always measure the foot before ordering!***
MozzieToezzies are hand-made, soft sole shoes for babies and toddlers, created and crafted by me in Woodburn OR
Studies show that the best shoes for babies and toddlers when they are starting to stand and walk are the ones that mimic bare feet. Because of this, soft soled shoes are recommended by pediatricians and podiatrists. Soft soled shoes promote good balance, help develop the strength and grasping action of little toes, and allow for wiggle room and growth.
This pair is a gold color faux leather. 
MozzieToezzies make wonderful gifts for baby showers and new moms, and are a great addition to any baby’s or toddler’s wardrobe.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, or for custom orders, MozzieToezzies are also available for wholesale. Email me at viktoriyaleonov [!at] yahoo.com and don't forget to also follow me on instagram @mozzietoezzie

            Size 3-6 months. These are handmade. You will have attention every time you take baby out in these! They also make a unique and memorable baby gift too. These adorable shoes are perfect for baby shower gift. This shoe style has a working button to ensure that the shoe is easy to put on and the button closure keeps the shoe on. 
This pair of mary jane's is done in bubblegum pink and tan yarn, and fastened with brown buttons. 
With a custom order request, sizes can be made that range from preemie all the way to 12 months, and larger sizes may be available by custom order. Want a different color? Just ask! If these are not exactly what you are looking for just ask for a custom order. You can find the link below the listing photo. There you are able to describe what you would want.
Making these adorable little crocheted shoes & booties is a hobby of mine. I have been crocheting for the last 2 decades, and these are a favorite. I formerly sold on eBay but regret to say how unfitting that is for an item like this. My little shoes & booties deserve better! I have brought them to Etsy to share them once again. 
I most always use synthetic yarns. I also need to mention that my items have small parts, such as buttons and embellishments. Props not included. I do all of my own photography to keep costs as low as possible.        ",15.00,5.0,"Handmade item
