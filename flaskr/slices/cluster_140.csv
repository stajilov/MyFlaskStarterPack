447,Vintage Canvas Czech Army Messenger Bag,"
            This is one gem of a vintage military bag!  Aside from being so very cool, it has 3 usable pockets inside!  And we all love pockets to hold our stuff and keep us organized!  It’s made from a tough khaki colored canvas.  The “look” of the bag is absolutely stellar.  I do have to tip my hat to the Czech military for creating such amazing bags!  It's date stamped on the inside flap from the 70's.
It’s a bit stiff after my thorough cleaning, sanitizing and deodorizing process, but it does soften with wear.  
 Like the other vintage military bags, it’s easy to wash when it gets dirty.  Mild soap, no soaking, shape the bag & let dry!  I like to iron them, they look nicer.
The Bag…
~  10”w x 8”h x 3.5”d
~  Large flap with 2 buckle closure (the buckles aren’t really necessary since the flap is so large.) But they look great! 
~  46” comfy, wide adjustable shoulder strap – can be carried cross body
~  Large main compartment
~  3 interior pockets – all decent sized!
~  Sturdy, heavyweight canvas fabric
. . . . . . . .CLEAN BAGS for your Carrying Pleasure . . . . . . . .
My vintage military bags have been thoroughly cleaned, sanitized and deodorized.  I even press them so they look nice!  It’s very time consuming (and really no fun at all!) but I would want nothing less than CLEAN in a bag I purchased.  Yes, I am a geek about these bags!  But with any vintage military...there may be an ever so tiny scent - generally ones with leather (minor, and it will go away with time.)  Most find it negligible or nonexistent and are amazed at how wonderfully clean my military bags are!!        ",48.00,4.9733,"Vintage item from the 1970s

7898,Thank you gift //Appreciation Gift// Thank you Candle//16 oz. Pure Soy//Choose Your Scent//Chalkboard Candle//Full of Thanks//,"
            Looking for the perfect way to say thank you to someone special? These candles are a wonderful way to tell someone special how full of thanks you are for all that they've done!! If ordering the gable box, you're more than welcome to put a special message on the box label. Please leave your message in the notes section at checkout. If you don't leave a message in the notes section, your box label will read full of thanks like the candle label. 
If you are ordering 1 candle with the gable box, these will be shipped inside the gable box, with label and ribbon attached. If ordering more than 1 candle the gable boxes will be shipped flat with sticker and ribbon NOT attached, this will need to be done by you :-) They are very quick and easy to assemble.
Each candle burns 90 hours, and is made out of 100% soy wax with a 100% cotton wick. You get  the maximum enjoyment out of this candle without polluting your home or air. Not only is this a natural burning product it's highly scented (using the maximum amount of scent that the soy wax will allow) it also burns evenly and cleanly so that you get the most for your money. There is barely a trace of wax when your done with your candle. I use only cosmetic grade fragrance oils or pure essential oils. I've been making candles for the past 6 yrs. and have tried 100's of scents and picked only the best smelling ones (I kind of have a fragrance addiction!!!).
Shipping: I try really hard to keep the shipping prices down, charging only the actual cost to me for shipping. Because candles are so heavy, bulk orders are the most cost effective way to ship. I can fit 6 large pint candles or 6 half-pint candles in a medium USPS Priority Mail box for 12.50 and 9 large pint or 9 half-pint candles in a large USPS Priority Mail box for  17.50. Anything extra you are charged for shipping will be refunded to you at the time the item is shipped. I have to put the maximum amount it can cost me to ship, depending on where the package is going. If ordering more than 2 candles feel free to convo me as well, and I can set up a custom order for you with the exact amount for shipping.
For all my local clients, if we have arranged to have me drop the candles off to you at church, school, ballet etc. type in the coupon code REGIONALSHIP2017 and it will delete all shipping costs. Please only apply this coupon if you have first contacted me. Thanks :)
Burning Instructions:
The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process insures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. 
Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children.
To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example burn a 3 inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass.
I  do customize orders for your personal needs/wants. Just convo me with any changes and I'll do my best to meet your needs. Please also feel free to ask any questions you may have or feel free to call me at 509/688-5409. My office hours are 7-5 Pacific Standard Time.
