            A beautiful, classically elegant Art Deco 'toi et moi' engagement ring, dating from the 1920s. The ring is worked in 18ct white gold, designed as a diamond and pearl bypass, the millegrain bezel set 0.62ct old cut diamond and whole pearl, to the sinuous shoulders bright cut pave set with eight diamonds, and the plain square section band. The sides of the shoulders and the pearl's setting have been exquisitely engraved with a very fine, delicate scrolling pattern.
The principal diamond is estimated at 0.62ct (measured in setting), SI1 clarity, J/K colour, with the further eight diamonds to the shoulders the total diamond weight is 0.70ct. The cultured pearl measures 6.5mm, of an ivory/cream hue, very good reflective lustre, likely to be an Akoya pearl.
The ring is marked '750' to denote 18ct gold. I would date this ring to the 1920s.

1163,"Art Nouveau Diamond Engagement Ring, Edwardian Engagement Ring, 14k White Gold Platinum Antique Engagement Ring, Art Nouveau Engagement Ring","
            This fiery Art Nouveau Edwardian era platinum and 14k white gold engagement ring has amazing filigree detail and five Old European Cut diamonds with a total carat weight of .41 carats. Size 4 1/2 and sizable up or down. 
Layaway available. Priority Shipping included in the US and Canada. Contact me for DHL rates outside of North America.
Five old cut diamonds sparkle out of this wonderfully crafted Art Nouveau setting. The Art Nouveau period ran from 1890 to 1910 and covered the end of the Victorian era and the Edwardian era. Designers felt that art should be part of everyday life and incorporated elements from nature into their work, especially elegant flowers, dragonflies and butterflies. 
This ring has strong nature themes. Around the diamonds there are tiny butterflies—or flowers, they can be seen as either. They soften the strong vertical and horizontal lines formed by the diamonds and milgrain edging. The original detailing is still in excellent condition with almost no wear. The milgrain is strongly articulated and sharp. 
The diamonds are estimated to be S1 to S2 in clarity and the color I to J. The central stone is about 3.7mm or .18ct. The other 4 stones are about 2.2mm or .04ct each, bring the total weight to approximately .34tcw.
The band is made of platinum and the face of 14k white gold. The inside of the band is not marked as was common during the time, but was tested as platinum and 14k gold. The top of the ring has an elevation of 4.5mm above the finger. The face measures 10.75mm north to south and 15mm east to west. The band is 4mm at the shoulders tapering to 2mm in the back. The ring weighs a substantial 2.6 grams. 
Currently size 4 1/2, the ring is sizable up or down. It can be resized to fit your finger by my personal jeweler for 45. Here is the listing to add to your cart when checking out:

1166,SOLD On Layaway - Ruby Ring 7.25 Carats Yellow gold 10K 4.5gm Size 8 25 July Birthstone,"
            SOLD  - on layaway Ruby Ring with ruby accents.  The ring features a large oval ruby that measure 14X12.  I've used the 7 carat measurement but it is a little larger.  There are 4 accent round rubies that total around .12Carats more.  This ring has a presence!  Measurements are 13mm N/S, 16mm E/W, 1.45mm at bottom of shank and a 7.75mm rise off of the finger.  The ruby is not the highest quality but it appears to be a natural ruby. It tests ruby on the Presidium Gem Tester and is not perfect as a lab created ruby would be.  You can see small inclusions in the gemstone.  It is certainly heat enhanced and is opaque, not translucent like a very fine ruby.  All this being said, it is a stunning ring and beautiful on the hand.  Set in solid 10K yellow gold, the ring is currently a size 8.25 and can be sized up or down as needed.  The gold weight is very good at 4.5grams of solid 10K gold.  This would be a stunning engagement ring and I paired it with a yellow gold band that is for sale in the store and it looked great.  Convo for picture of that combination if interested.  Actual item is pictured but greatly enlarged for detail.  All measurements are taken in mounting and estimated.        ",237.50,5.0,"Vintage item

1170,Antique Engagement Ring | Vintage Engagement Ring | Vintage Diamond Ring | Diamond Engagement Ring | Georgian Engagement Ring Georgian Ring,"
            The rose cut is, in our opinion, amongst the most romantic of old diamond cuts, and in the Georgian era, it reigned supreme. The earliest rose cut dates probably to the 16th century, when new techniques of cutting and polishing allowed for the creation of the first fully faceted diamonds. Since then, it has been a never-ending quest to maximize the ""brilliance"" of diamonds through ever more complex mathematical cutting formulas. But the earliest faceted cuts, such as the rose cut, are a stunning contrast of rough and refined, honoring the irregular outlines of the original rough diamond crystal but unlocking its fire by covering its surface in smooth, polished facets. They seem to capture the mystery and wonder that diamonds still embodied in the Middle Ages in a way that was lost through the centuries. While modern cuts have maximized the fire of light refraction, they have sadly lost the more subtle and mystical glow from within. While the modern brilliant is a bold and blustery extrovert, the rose cut is quietly contemplative with sudden flashes of dazzling inspiration. We know which one we'd rather be. And we know which diamond cut we'd pick any day.
Antique Georgian diamond three-stone ring in gold and silver. A large and flashing rose cut diamond is held in a period closed-back, silver-topped pinched collet setting. It's a beautifully cut stone, and is clearly the showpiece of this otherwise simple ring. The split shank shoulders support an additional tiny rose cut diamond on each side, also ensconced in their closed-back, silver-topped pinched collet settings. The gold shank is simple, with only some tiny grooves flanking the side stones for definition. A lovely Georgian ring that remains a classic even after more than two hundred years! The center rose cut is estimated at approximately .56 to .60 carats, J color, I clarity, with a lovely ""crystal clear"" appearance to the naked eye. Due to the irregular nature of the side stones, it's not possible to estimate their weight. No hallmarks, but tests as 22K gold and silver. Circa 1800. This ring is in good vintage condition. It has received a light cleaning and polish by its previous owner. It's recommended to avoid getting Georgian rings wet, as Georgian era closed-back settings contain foil to heighten the brilliance of the stones, and getting them wet can damage the foil.  
This ring is currently a US size 4 3/4-5, but can be resized by your local jeweler.

            ♥ TIM THE TERRIER - VINTAGE 1940's KNITTING PATTERN ♥
✽ PLEASE NOTE - YOU WILL BE SENT A PRINTED COPY OF THE KNITTING PATTERN NOT THE ORIGINAL PATTERN.
Wonderful vintage 1940's Weldons knitting pattern No. 305 for 'Tim The Terrier' originally printed in England and no longer under copyright.
Tim is knitted in moss stitch sections, sewn up and then firmly stuffed.
The pattern suggests a wool weight of 3 ply fingering used double throughout, but also states you can use thicker yarn.
3 ply was a fine yarn used for lacy knitting, so for this pattern they wanted knitters to use two strands of it together to make a thicker yarn. Today 3 ply patterns can use Double knit (DK), Light worsted or Fingering yarns, so you'd use two strands of DK wool.                              
I used an aran wool to knit this dog and it came up lovely and chunky.
Needle size for 3 ply used double: 
   Old UK  Canadian - 12
   US - 2
   Metric - 2.75 mm
   Japanese - 2
  
Obviously if you use a different weight wool for the pattern, you will need to use the recommended size needles for the yarn you are using.
✽  You will be sent the pattern printed onto both sides of A4 white card protected by a plastic folder also a paper copy in case you like to mark where you are when knitting, all posted in a hard backed envelope.

7635,1oz Organic Dried Lavender,"
            Dried Lavender ( Select Grade)
The origin of Lavender is believed to be from the Mediterranean, Middle East, and India. Its history goes back some 2500 years. Lavender is a flowering plant of the mint family known for its beauty, its sweet floral fragrance, and its multiple uses.
Lavender derives its name from the Latin ‘lavare’ meaning ‘to wash”. The Romans used Lavender to scent their baths, beds, clothes and even hair. They also discovered its medicinal properties.
Select grade has a more pronounced floral flavor with hints of grass, but less bitter. It possesses a subtly fresh, sweeter flavor that works well as a culinary ingredient and in loose teas and tea bags. It has a medium deepness of lavender color, less- stems and leaves. The deeper color also means Select lavender will look nice in clear and open containers of potpourri and other herbal blends
Whether you’re making potpourri, lavender bags, wedding favors, wedding toss or using our dried lavender as a sleep aid you’ll be pleased with the potency of aroma and gorgeous color of our dried lavender.
Wedding favors
Lavender bags make lovely wedding favors. They are inexpensive and useful to take home and put in a drawer or by your bed. The bag can also be color coordinated with the wedding theme. Dried lavender flowers have also become popular for use at weddings as decoration, gifts and as confetti for tossing over the newlyweds.
Sleep aid
Try keeping a relaxing lavender bag by your pillow for a good night’s sleep. The action of lavender can be enhanced by the addition of dried hops to make a lavender and hop pillow. 
Drawer freshener
Dried lavender will bring a linen-fresh scent to your clothes. Just leave a lavender bag in each drawer or the airing cupboard, and squeeze regularly to refresh the scent – this releases the natural essential oils from the buds.

            ::: LOOP WHIP BDSM & PUNISHMENT SPANKING TOOL (TOY) :::: 
This BDSM Loop Whip is made with high tensile strength ptfe (aka: teflon) and features a one-of-a-kind hand turned wooden handle wrapped in fine gauge hemp.  
* This is no entry level tool. It is made specifically to leave welts and break skin in a concentrated impact. Due to the flexible nature of the whip the patterning is unique with every strike. 
--------------------: FEATURES :----------------- 
--- DIMENSIONS ----
Loop Length = ~24"" (~10-14"" from handle base to apex of loop)
Handle Length = ~7"" (depending on thickness)
Handle Diameter = 1.5""  (thicker at whip/handle junction for 3/8"" thickness)
* Due to the nature of how the handles are made, each one will be completely unique in design, however the general aesthetic and dimensions will be uniform.  As with all wood products, grain patterns and color variations are always present and to be expected. 
--------THICKNESS :----
- 1/4""   =  More sting, more flex, thinner marking lines, more recoil. 
- 3/8""  =  More impact, less flex, thicker marking lines, less recoil. 
- 1/2""   =  Serious impact, even less flex, thick marking lines, little recoil. 
------ HANDLE Type/Color -----

- Tapered (Dark or Natural)
- Wood Wrapped with Jute (Dark or Natural)

About Ayala Jewelry:
https://www.etsy.com/il-en/shop/AyalaDiamonds/about
Moissanite is the perfect diamond alternative, beautiful shiny stone, full of luster and brilliance that outshines even diamonds. Today it is a the most popular alternative to diamonds. Moissanite is rated as a 9.25, which is a great score that is higher than any gemstone used in jewelry besides diamonds. Unlike diamonds, which are carbon, Moissanites are silicon carbide (SiC), a very rare, naturally occurring mineral found primarily in meteors. We use only Charles & Colvard moissanite.

11305,Elegant Silver Rose Engagement Bridal Ring Set with White Sapphire - Delicate Silver Diamond Alternative Rose Wedding Anniversary Ring Set,"
            This beautiful Sterling Silver Rose Ring and Twisted Band Bridal Set includes two individual Sterling Silver bands: a sculptural rose ring that features a sparkling 3 mm round stone weighing approximately .15 carats and a twisted band made from two intertwined wires. We are happy to create this ring set for you in a variety of ring sizes, stone choices, and finishes!
For the Rose Ring:
This ring features a beautiful Sterling Silver rose that blooms from the top of the band and holds a 3 mm (approximately .15 carats) faceted stone. The sculptural silver rose measures approximately 7 mm round, and is accented by gently curving silver leaves that add to the illusion of a captured bloom that is blossoming forever from your loved one's hand. The band measures 1.5 mm wide, and is finished in a comfortably rounded square wire. 
The ring shown in these pictures feature a sparkling faceted lab White Sapphire, but can be created with your choice of stone. To see how these different stones look, please visit our engagement section here: 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/moonkistdesigns?section_id=12498398&ref=shopsection_leftnav_9
For the Twisted Band:
The second band is created from two Sterling Silver round wires and is one of the oldest and the simplest of patterns in jewelry fabrication - taking two wires and twisting them together to form a single strand. The symbolism of using a twisted band to represent a new life together is perfect, and the band looks like it has grown as part of the ring...rose vines entwined. This band measures 1.5 mm wide and is smoothed for a comfortable fit.
Most of the jewelry that is shown in my store has been antiqued and then re-polished in order to better show details during photography, but we are also happy to create these pieces with a bright, mirror finish or satin, matte finish if you prefer. I am happy to create my jewelry for you in any size you need, including half and quarter ring sizes and custom necklace and bracelet lengths. Please let me know if you have any questions about these amazing pieces!

            This lovely nature inspired ring focuses on a beautiful and nice sized- 2 carats! natural conflict free rough diamond.
It is light silver white in color and a pretty symmetrical shape- the stone has a great crystalline structure that gives off quite a sparkle.
I have set it in a fine silver bezel and it sits nestled in a silver twig that was cast from a real tree.
All the details of the twig are just as they were from the tree.
Next to this is a hand cut leaf in solid 24 karat gold for a really striking contrast!
This particular diamond is sold, but the ring will be made with one very similar and in the same 2 carat size.

13813,Light Creamy Champagne Deep V Lace Wedding Dress,"
            Hello! I am new to Etsy. As I was looking around for my own wedding dress, I realized how difficult it is and how pricey some of the price tags are. After so many Google and Pinterest searches, we are all exhausted. On top of that, going to a bridal shop can oftentimes be intimidating. Therefore, I want to help you find/create that perfect dress! 
My guiding mission is to help you be different, be confident, but most importantly, be you.
Please note each wedding dress is uniquely made to your body measurements. I do not stock pre-made dresses for sale, these listings are just examples of my recent work. All dresses are 100% hand-made. Production usually takes about 4-8 weeks depending on the specific design. *I only take a certain number of orders per month to ensure the quality of work and the time I dedicate to each client's dress.* 
I specialize in custom designs! — which means I can help you conceptualize a unique design or create something you've long wished for from a photo. In addition, every dress in my listings can also be altered to different colors of fabric, different design details and more. Therefore, please do not hesitate to contact me if you want something custom-made. =) 
Currently I am only listed to ship to a handful of countries to limit the amount of orders I get each month. If you are located in a country I have not listed, please feel free to contact me for more information.
I am committed to perfection and customer satisfaction. Each finished products is considered an individual artwork. I understand the importance of your wedding and the memories that last years after. Therefore, I will make it my duty to make sure it is absolutely flawless.        ",650.00,5.0,"Handmade item

16305,Handmade sapphire engagement ring- gold engagement ring,"
            This organic style engagement ring is handmade from 9ct gold and sterling silver in my London studio. 
Sparkling in the centre is a beautiful clear round 4mm Cubic Zirconia, with a 2mm sapphire either side, these gemstones have been hand set in sterling silver.  
The band is made from 2mm thick round 9ct gold wire. This ring is thin enough to be worn next to another ring but thick enough to be robust, making it ideal to wear as an engagement ring. The band has been given a hammered texture and a satin finish to the surface of the gold rather than a polished finish, if you would like your ring shiny and polished please leave a message at check out and I will happily polish your ring for you. 
This ring will be custom made to your size, when you check out please state your ring size in the 'Note to SilverJewelleryHS' text box . Please note that due to the organic making process each ring will differ slightly from the one pictured but will be every bit as beautiful.
The ring is then carefully packaged in an elegant gift box.

            These slippers are warm, comfortable and most of all - stylish!  
Perfect for hardwood, laminate and linoleum floors, the leather soles are anti-slip helping your special one stay safe with better footing, and last longer than traditional crochet soles.  
Each pair is made to order - by me - with great attention to detail.  They make the delightful gift for someone you love!
These boots are available in either the single button or double button cuff design depending on your preference. The buttons not only look great, they are fully functional as well. 
I have several color options to chose from, if you like to go bold with an all-over color, keep it cool with a modest neutral or play a bit with a fun sole contrast, YOU decide!  Convo me before you place your order to talk about all of the color details. (One of my favorite subjects!)
These slippers can accommodate any child with sizes ranging from a toddler to a school age kid.   The sole measurement for each size are as follows:  (Bear in mind that these slippers should fit snugly as they will stretch a bit with wear.)
size 7/8 - 5 1/2""
size 8/9 - 6""
size 10/11 - 6 1/2""
size 12/13 - 7 1/4""
size sr 1/2 - 8""
All of my items come from a smoke free home.  I make every effort to provide you with an accurate portrayal of my items, however due to computer monitor settings and yarn dye lots, colors may not be exactly as they appear.  Buttons may also be different from the ones pictured.
I recommend hand washing and air drying your slippers to extend their life.
