9292,Play Canopy - White - Hanging Play Tent,"
            Item is made to order. Please allow two weeks from purchase date until your item will ship. 
This tent is made with a very lightweight cotton gauze fabric.
It is still strong and durable but is very thin and let's the light through so beautifully. It's the same type of fabric that some receiving blankets you may have seen or used are made from. I have added a little loop that hangs down on the inside of the tent so you could hang a little something on the inside like the paper ball or pompom. They even make lanterns with a battery operated light that I think would be so cute to add a little light on the inside!  It is very gender neutral and would be perfect for a boy, girl, or shared space. This tent is one that could really grow with your child as their room decor and tastes change because it has such a simple timeless design. 
The inside of this tent has a custom made hoop that is included with your order. It is 20"" across. The tent hangs about 8 feet long and gradually gets larger towards the bottom. 
All products designed by me, Terri. 
This tent is all about letting your Imagination take over! My kids like to pretend all different things in their tent. It is the perfect little hideaway from toddler to teen. Add a book sling (also available in my shop) on the wall next to it and let it be a reading nook.
All of the inside seams are serged to prevent fraying and give everything a very professional look inside and out.  It is very simple to put together, all you need is the included hoop, a hook and chain or rope to hang and adjust it to your liking.
To wash your tent wash in cold water with mild detergent on gentle cycle, tumble dry low and remove just before dry.        ",147.00,4.9481,"Handmade item

            Thanks for looking at my sugar hearts. I started making these 4 years ago for my future daughter in law. She wanted something special for their wedding tea. I can make most colours to match wedding themes.
The hearts can be kept the same as ordinary sugar in a dry container.Donot put in the fridge.
They have no expiry date.The colour does not flavour or leave a frothy residue on the drinks.
The hearts can be used in hots drinks or in glass of bubbly to give it that something special.
Each sugar heart equals 1 teaspoon of sugar
Each order is made up of 100 sugar hearts

About the glass in the photos: 
These photos were NOT retouched. These glass pieces are NOT misleading. The glass was pulled blindly from our ""B"" grade inventory. This glass represents the average piece. 
If you are not terribly picky about your glass, you will love this glass as well as the price because once you create something with this glass, you will forget it was ever called Grade B. 
If you are picky about your glass, then this glass is not for you. We offer Grade A glass called Glamour FX (TM), which you can buy here: Glamour FX Glass Collection:

18900,Custom upcycled REWORKED vintage BOHO boots festival BOOTS gypsy boots ankle boots belted boots Cowgirl Boots Upcycled boots,"
            Hello and welcome to my boot design shop where I can make your design come to life! I am the original boot remaker here on Etsy since 2012! Please read on to see everything about the design process from ordering to my creating your vision!!! 
*THE HEEL OF THIS BOOT CAN BE 1.5 INCH - 3 INCH unless you specify. It can take longer to get the higher heeled boots.
CUSTOM ORDER: (Photos in the listing are representations of boots I have made in the past and not the actual boots you will receive). This is a design process that takes time and each pair is an original.
The process of a custom design:
1) You place order and pay, and on your order comments, you can tell me style preferences.
2) After about 3 weeks, I message you in Etsy with photos of your boots for you to approve of or request any desired changes. It is important you check Etsy for your messages from me.
3) If no changes are needed, I complete the boot attachments and ship your boots in about 1-2 days.
4) If changes are requested, I will send out new photos in a few days and then ship upon your approval. 
What you will get:
You will receive from me one pair of boots (as photos I have sent you show) made of leather in the color, style, and size you have requested with permanently attached decoration. Your boots may be vintage (preowned) or sometimes new leather boots.  If you require new boots, you may use the order listing for NEW boots in my shop. You will also receive insoles if the boots I used are vintage.
Refunds/Exchanges: Exchange only on custom orders (no refunds). See my shop policy.
To see my past work:  https://www.pinterest.com/julielikesart/thelookfactory/
*Special Notes:  I have made hundreds of pairs - each pair original. 
Your special boots will be made to order in a similar look as listing and with leather boots in your size depending on your own style preferences. I can use belts, shells, trims, chains, charms, feathers, lace, fabrics, tapestries, and faux or vintage fur pieces – just let me know if there is something specific you like or do not like.
*Processing time: Minor delays may occur if you want changes after seeing the photos or if I am backed up in orders.
*Shipping: normally 2-3 days in the US (15), and 10-15 days international (45). Express shipping available for additional fee of 20. International buyers pay their own custom duty fees if imposed.
* Sizing: I use US sizing. If you are an international customer you can use a size conversion guide such as is found here: http://www.i18nguy.com/l10n/shoes.html and I usually size up 1/2 size if using vintage as they run small. 
If you have any questions, just ask. I would love to make some special boots for you!        ",225.00,4.9481,"Handmade item
