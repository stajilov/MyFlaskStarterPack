4822,"Fire Agate Tumbled, MANIFESTATION, Vitality, Energy, Creativity, Sexuality, Will,","
            This stone has a powerful vibration, one that makes you want to bravely take action.  It can help you to feel fully grounded and physically aware, and it quickens the fire in your spirit and helps you remember that being alive feels totally awesome!!!
 Fire agate is also a stone of courage, protection, and sexy time. ;) Mystical lore says that it relieves fears, halts gossip and even reflects any threat of harm back to the source. Fire agate can enhance energy, including meditation, ritual, and spiritual healing energies.  It also heightens creativity and sexual energies. 
The vibration of this crystal brings you into the blaze of spiritual energy flow. Yet its vibration is quite calming, and brings feelings of safety and security. It is also highly stimulating to the reproductive region and may aid fertility in both men and women. It kicks depressions butt and will help with fear relating to sexual intimacy along with stoking the sexual fires within.
Metaphysical healing professes that fire agate enhances all healing energies, and assists with healing of the circulatory system, lymph system, intestines. It is also used in crystal healing to take the edge off the emotional charge of problems.  Fire agate is associated primarily with the sacral and root chakras. 
Every stone in my shop is CHERRY PICKED for beauty and quality. While I see the appeal of dealing straight with the mine, I choose to source all of my stones from a wholesaler that gets them from the mines. This allows me to only choose only very best pieces that comes in the shipments. ❤️
This listing is for (1) Tumbled Fire Agate. Each piece is approximately 1"". Your piece will be chosen by my intuition with your energy in mind.
Everything in my shop has been lovingly cleared and blessed with the highest intention allowing for perfect vibration and most potent energy of each crystal.
*Note that healing crystal meanings are spiritual supports to healing and are not prescriptions or healthcare information.

 The cake size is approx 11"" round for the bottom Tier and 8"" for the top tier and 3"" tall. This cake has served as a Large Cupcake for Shepherd to A Nice size cake for Tinier Breeds. I have personally made this cake for my 3 Puggles and My daughters 2 Pitties and there is still some leftover..... I give them about 2 pieces each.  I then Freeze the rest!
THIS TREAT is NOT Wheat or Gluten free BUT we are excited to NOW have a WHEAT, GLUTEN & GRAIN FREE Recipe .... Option listed is Grain-Wht-Gltn-Free (they dont offer enough characters to spell it all out) and is a 2.50 extra charge.

7489,Java Junkie Coffee Scrub 4 fl. oz. in MOCHA LATTE,"
            Our Java Junkie Coffee Scrub will leave your skin feeling soft and looking radiant! Our emulsified exfoliating formula is made using high quality, all natural coffee, which softens skin as it scrubs away dirt and dead skin cells. This formula also contains skin-loving Coconut Oil, Vitamin E oil and Sunflower Seed Oil, making this aromatic exfoliating scrub a luxurious staple in any skin care regime.
4 fl. oz. of our Java Junkie Coffee Scrub is measured by volume and packaged as seen in the photos, sealed in a clear PET plastic jar with a tamper-evident sealed liner printed ""SEALED for YOUR PROTECTION "", in your choice of packaging style, with “MOCHA LATTE” fragrance. 
CHOOSE YOUR STYLE: Please make your Packaging Style selection from the drop down menu on the right. If a style preference is not selected, one will be chosen at random.
At Dirty Girl Beauty, we do not add any chemical sulfates, parabens, petrochemicals, mineral oil or phthalates to any of our product formulas. * Our products are tested exclusively on friends, never on animals. *
Directions for Use:
For the best results, always use a sugar scrub while taking a shower. Cleanse and rinse your body as usual, then use our Java Junkie Coffee Scrub to exfoliate and condition your skin. Apply a handful of sugar scrub to wet skin and massage over the entire body, taking care to avoid eyes and other delicate areas. Gently rubbing in a circular motion is most effective as it helps to free ingrown hairs, exfoliate dead skin cells and remove dirt and debris. It is also less abrasive than a back and forth movement. Thoroughly rinse with warm water and pat dry or air dry.
Tips:
It is fine to use bath mitts and gloves as long as they are air dried and kept clean to prevent them from harboring bacteria.
When exfoliating, err on the side of gentle to avoid irritating the skin. Discontinue use if skin irritation occurs.
Immediately after using a scrub, you may want to apply a moisturizer. For added protection, look for products that contain sunflower or sweet almond oils, as well as shea butter.
Your scrub should be stored with the lid tightly closed in a cool dark place to maximize the shelf life.
INCI Label:
INGREDIENTS: Pure Raw Cane Sugar (Sucrose), Sunflower Seed Oil (Helianthus Annuus), Coffee (Coffea Arabica), Coconut Oil (Cocos Nucifera), Emulsifying Wax NF, Stearic Acid NF (vegetable), Vitamin E Oil (Prunus Dulcis (Almond) Oil, Tocopherol), Fragrance oil, Optiphen Preservative (Phenoxyethanol and Caprylyl Glycol)
Coffee & Skin Care:
Many people jump-start their day with a cup of coffee, but did you know that coffee also has a number of perks for your skin, from treating redness and inflammation to reducing the appearance of cellulite?
Incorporating coffee in your skin care regime can help you achieve evenly toned, smoother skin. Coffee containing caffeine is a rich source of antioxidants. Your body is a war-zone between two types of molecules: free radicals and antioxidants. Free radicals damage healthy cells, while antioxidants work to protect against free radical damage. Antioxidants can neutralize the damaging effects of free radicals on the inner layer of skin, which is often reflected in age spots and wrinkles. In short, antioxidants help bolster your skin’s natural defenses.
The caffeine in coffee dehydrates skin cells in a good way by energizing them, causing the release of sodium, potassium and water, thus helping skin appear smoother. Because of this, caffeine is often utilized in cellulite reduction. Caffeine has potent anti-inflammatory properties, which can assist in reducing puffiness. When applied topically, the caffeine in coffee also works as a vasodilator, which means that it constricts and tightens the blood vessels in the skin, thereby improving skin texture.
Additionally, ground coffee is a natural and organic exfoliant. Regular exfoliation of the skin removes residual dirt and dead skin cells, stimulates the production of new skin cells, and revitalizes your skin. Freshly exfoliated skin absorbs moisture much more effectively.
Learn more about our Featured Ingredient: Vitamin E Oil!
Vitamin E Oil:
Vitamin E oil is naturally occurring oil, which is soluble in lipid and is non-enzymatic. The skin benefits of vitamin E come from its antioxidant properties. Antioxidants remove free radicals — the unstable compounds that damage the cell structure. Vitamin E oil can help smooth the appearance of wrinkles by boosting collagen production, a connective tissue that keeps skin elastic. It supports new skin cell growth and helps speed up cell regeneration. Vitamin E oil also has anti-inflammatory properties. As the epidermis layer of the skin absorbs vitamin E, it can be used for treating sunburn or acne. Vitamin E oil prevents water loss from the skin and helps it to retain its natural moisture. Vitamin E oil can help dull-looking, dry skin look healthier and fresher.

7762,"Hairpin Legs for DIY Furniture: Sizes 17""-20""","
            Hairpin legs are a classic design that seems to go with any décor which makes these an excellent choice for DIY furniture projects. One of the best things about these legs is they are super strong and we actually use a hairpin leg table for a work table. They hold upwards of 3 to 400 lbs easily. The bar is 3/8, the plate is 4.75 long. Each leg comes with screws and a floor protector. We sell by the leg, so 1 equals 1 leg. Shipping charges include recyclable/recycled fiber packaging paper and FedEx home delivery. Home delivery costs a bit more but they do deliver on Saturdays in most areas. Shipping is 12 a leg and 1 for each additional leg. 
*Please note, any legs that stand above 25 inches have a tendency to wobble. This is the nature of steel so they may hold 500LBs but they wobble. This can pose a problem for dinner tables or writing desks where it is important for the table to be steady. 
 We try to be competitive by offering maximum value and quality. We offer more holes for the mounting plate for optimum security to your wood top. We also bevel and fillet weld using an industrial welder that is probably over the top but we make sure the welds are very strong. We do not do hidden welds or otherwise cosmetic welding as this is not ideal for loadbearing applications. Please beware of sellers offering such welding, it is unsuitable for table legs. This is the reason many legs from the 50's fall apart because they were not welded for long term use. This may be one of the few times when saying, ""they don't make them how they used to"" is a good thing.
Each leg comes with self drilling screws and a floor protector so they are ready to go right out of the box. When ordering, please select the number of legs you would like with the size you need. If you are looking for another size, you can access those sizes in other listings in our main store. 
The mounting plate is a little under 4.75 long and has five 1/4 inch holes with the majority of holes around the bars for maximum stability. Our legs have a slight angle at 10 degrees. We offer a darker grey (hot rolled) or raw(cold rolled) steel from mills we hand select from right here in the US. The dark grey is more rustic and worn looking steel which can have varying greys and browns with very minimal rust spots and pitting. Please select this option for a more rustic look. We also offer a raw steel that is perfect for polishing, painting or patinas. This looks a lot like stainless steel. 
Our legs are raw and can have oil, dirt, grime and other varieties. We do a light wipe down of each leg. We do not sell heavily rusted or otherwise gouged legs. We recommend that some sort of top coat should be applied whether its paint, wax or a little polyurethane. Wax is your best bet and a giant tub can be purchased for around 6 at any hardware store. I recommend Johnson's Paste wax. We would recommend just wiping them down with a rag and giving them a light waxing. 
Please check your address when ordering, Philly Fabrication cannot be responsible for items delivered to the wrong address. Please contact us if you live in Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico before ordering to get a shipping quote. 
How to Finish the Raw Steel: Take steel wool/scotchbrite pad and scrub the steel until the look you want is created. You can use a high zero steel wool to create a great polish. If you are looking to paint, please see the many tutorials online on how to paint steel. Please keep in mind finish the raw steel comes with is good on its own. 
Please contact us for information about any of what we have on this site. Please ask us anything about sizing, materials, etc. We are happy to help. Philly Fabrication is not responsible for wrong sizing so please contact us for any guidance any project, we will offer any support we can give.

7819,"ON SALE QUEEN Comforter - perfect comfort,for all seasons, handmade wool comforter, luxury bedding, organic duvet insert, housewarming gift","
            LISTING: 
Queen size, all seasons warmth, all-natural handpicked virgin wool filled comforter. 
Chemically untreated wool provides the perfect four-season comfort no matter where you live. That's because wool is naturally thermo-regulating – it's insulating in the cold, and cool and breathable when it's warm. Feel comfortable and stay warm all year round. 
""Good Night"" products are handmade, starting from sheep farming to the final product. 
DETAILS:
• Dimensions - 90""x90"" 
• Fabric - 100% cotton sateen, Oeko-tex certified
• Filling - 100% all-natural handpicked virgin wool that has not been treated with any harmful chemicals or additives, 450 GSM.
FABRIC COLOR:
All items pictured in our shop are in ""Off White"". Before ordering other color please contact us to make sure we have the chosen fabric. We are trying to do our best to represent exact fabric colors on pictures but color may slightly vary due to screen resolution and digital photography.
CARE:
Dry cleaning is the best way to clean a wool comforter. In between the dry cleaning, a good shake in open air is adequate. Also ventilate if a natural wool smell seems too strong. Protect your comforter with a duvet cover, which keeps it clean and prolongs its life. It's much more preferable to frequently clean the duvet cover than to have to constantly clean the comforter.

https://www.etsy.com/listing/248482750/queen-size-organic-wool-filled-pillow?ref=shop_home_active_2
HOW IT IS MADE:
Industry processes wool in huge quantities and uses technological advances for that. They wash wool with harsh and efficient detergents. Here machines as human hands work which can't have a contact with these agents. Carbonising, bleaching, polymer coating and other are conventional wool processing methods. The way it passes damages the wool fiber and loses the major part of the unique features. 
Our products use wool untreated by chemicals, just hand washed using natural soap. The chosen method of processing is much heavier but it ensures high-quality and is environment friendly. Hand washed wool preserves the lanolin, which helps to ensure its softness and waviness. Wool is not only the least vulnerable, but also is pleasant to cuddle up. It's time and physical strength consuming work. But the easier way - to buy industrially processed wool is not pointed in our plans. Other way, the idea to share truthful wishes from the countryside would lose its meaning.
100% HANDCRAFTED:
""Good Night"" products are handmade, starting from sheep farming to the final product. Sheep shearing at the farm takes place over a few days and is an interesting sight. Also of interest is 'wool carding', a mechanical process that disentangles, cleans and intermixes fibers to produce a continuous web or sliver suitable for subsequent processing. Finally wool webs lies on a luxury cotton cloth, and professional seamstresses hands turns it to lovely bedding

8297,Coconut Vanilla Vegan Aluminum Free  Cream Deodorant,"
            Coconut VanillaVegan Aluminum Free  Cream Deodorant
 ****HEAT WARNING! Warm weather will keep the deodorant in a more liquid state.  This is natural due to the high content of coconut oil, which melts at very low temperatures.  This is normal and does not affect the deodorant at all.  If it separates, just give it a quick stir before using.  It is recommended to keep it in the fridge during the warmer months if you prefer it to be more solid.  
A recent study has shown that it takes 10 seconds for our skin to absorb into our body what we put on to it.  Have you ever looked at the ingredients list on commercial deodorants?  Do you really want to put all those chemicals on your skin and into your body???  I use only natural ingredients - aluminum-free baking soda helps absorb moisture and odor, arrowroot powder aids in moisture absorbtion, kaolin clay also helps with moisture and odor elimination.  Coconut oil has long been known as a natural deodorizer.  
This is a deodorant formula only - although it does help hinder excess moisture, it will not stop it.  It was created to effectively control odor all day long.  If you've never used all natural deodorant before, its best to give your body a few days to get used to it.  Your body needs to adjust to the changes from using chemicals to going all natural.
This listing is for one 2oz shallow jar of  deodorant cream.  To use it, scoop out a pea sized amount and rub into your underarm area.  There are no artificial hardeners in this deodorant - it will soften  at contact with your skin, making it quite easy to apply.  If it seems too soft, pop it into the fridge for a few minutes.  The oils will sink in quite quickly, but to be safe, wait a few minutes before getting dressed.

            Here's a Zelda inspired Joycon Grip you can take on the go without fear of losing or damaging your main one. Or if you need an extra grip for player two! 
The triangle shaped grip makes it very comfortable to hold. The Joy-Cons simply slide on and off.
Every print is tested on my joy-cons to make sure they have a firm grip and work properly. 
*fixed the issue about the grip being too tight*

10518,Bronze Guitar Pick Handmade with I Pick You - Custom Guitar Pick GP009,"
            I pick you is fresh out of my studio more beautiful than ever and now available in bronze. Custom cut in our own studio from 20 gauge bronze and stamped by hand with I Pick You, this bronze guitar pick rocks out the love for any occasion 
To impress with stunning contrast, a dark patina has been added to the lettering, before burnishing the bronze, and finishing the metal with a soft buffing wheel for a radiant bronze glow.
The guitar pick features filed edges and polished surfaces to give your strings and fingers a little love. 
Bronze is an amazing metal with a more metallic sound quality when used as a pick. In fact there are musicians that specifically seek out bronze picks to add a unique tone quality to their music. I made this guitar pick from 20 gauge bronze as a medium weight pick according to the Wikipedia guitar pick scale, so that the pick would easier to use and play than the 18 gauge or thick metal. Of course, I can accept custom orders for 18 gauge thick and heavy picks or lightweight 22 gauge picks. The 20 gauge feels just right with a perfect bright tone.
This guitar pick measures about 1.3 inch long by 1.2 wide and has a very solid feel at a comfortable weight. If you would like a custom size, personalized stamping, or your very own custom bronze guitar pick, don't hesitate to contact me. Move out of the Stone Age and into the Bronze Age with a shiny new bronze pick. Thanks for visiting my Etsy shop.. Nici

CAN I USE MAIL MERGE?
In Word and older versions of Pages, it is possible, but very tricky if you've never done it before. Instructions will vary depending on your software type, version, and what application you have your guest addresses in. Often, it is quicker to copy/paste your addresses as you go along. 
I do not recommend attempting mail merge unless you are very familiar with the process. At this time, I cannot offer assistance with mail merge.

            Watermelon Tourmaline Slice by the carat - small piece natural crystal sliced polished on both sides - pink green bicolor - RANDOM by weight
 Watermelon Tourmaline crystal slices of  natural crystal, polished on both sides.
This listing is for Tourmaline slices equalling the weight you choose to purchase.
This listing is strictly for RANDOM SELECTION 
Please do not purchase unless you agree to the Randomness of the selection
No requests for specific attributes can or will be honored on this listing out of fairness to all who purchase this listing in the understanding that they are receiving random selection, not picked over.
The slices will total the weight you purchase.  If for example you purchase 5 carats, whether you buy 1 carat and select quantity of 5, or buy 5 carats at a quantity of one, either way you will receive a quantity of 5 carats not 5 one carat pieces or one 5 carat pieces.  This listing is by WEIGHT not by quantity.  
These slices are 1/2 carat to 5 carats on average.
Some are ""imperfect"" in one way or another -- they may be uneven, or not a complete circle, or an irregular shape, or not the same width all the way throughout.  This is a reduced price listing for pieces from the EXACT lot pictured, and please do not purchase this listing unless you agree to the terms as laid out in this listing or do not understand the weights / measurements.
As mentioned, they are about 1/2 carat to 5 carats.  Most are around 3/4 carat to 1.5 carat.  
The total lot shown is about 90 carats.
Again this listing is for RANDOM selection to equal the total weight that you purchase
They range from approximately 5 to 15 mm in diameter.  Some may be slightly larger or smaller
(an inch is 25 mm.)  
graph paper has 1/4 inch squares 
one ruler is showing inches and the other ruler is showing mm / cm  
coin in photo is a us dime for size comparison
Paprok Mines.
A small stone about 5 mm in diameter is about 1 carat.
 Great to use as a stone in a multi stone wire wrap, or for creating items used in crystal healing or reiki.  These are not large.  They would be a good size for a ring or earrings.   If you need this to be made into a piece of wire wrapped jewelry, this can be arranged at an additional charge
Combined shipping is available on multiple purchases and occurs automatically.  
Please read description and measurements and view all photos before purchasing

14930,SaleToday Small Vintage Wooden Bobbin Industrial Era Ratcheted Spools Organize Display Home Decor,"
            Small vintage textile mill braider bobbins, all with wooden gear-like ratcheted tops AND bottoms. 
The braider bobbin was used to produce a uniform braid in a 'maypole' style wrap, often water was used to power the braiding machines. Each bobbin is 4 1/2 inches tall and 1 3/4 inches wide at the top. Trim shown is for display only, not for sale. Ratcheted bobbins are scored along the shaft (in last photo) when last of the yarn or fiber is removed from the bobbin with a hand knife.
The wooden bobbin is a bit of textile history. Made to last. Victorian textile mills developed wooden bobbins and spools to organize the threads on their looms, completely transforming the way textiles were produced during the industrial revolution. 
An enduring way to organize your twine, ribbons and trims. Something to re-use, not toss. Or killer chess pieces for the serious textile hound. ;-)
Please note: As always, I quickly refund any shipping over-payments, beyond a dollar, without being asked. Haven't had one complaint yet!        ",9.00,4.9696,"Vintage Supply from 1900 - 1909

16436,5 Pack assorted Tillandsia Ionantha air plants - Rainforest Alliance Donation Item!,"
            This pack will include 5 easy-to-care-for Tillandsia ionantha species only air plants.  Tillandsia air plants are low maintenance and high reward.  Give them light and an occasional water spray and they will turn beautiful shades of pink, red, yellow, and orange.  In no time at all, you will enjoy a beautiful, bright bloom! Better yet, the excitement starts long before blooming time for many of these, as they grow pups throughout their lifespan. Care Instructions will be provided, but take care to tailor your routine to your specific environment.
Sizing and Appearance: You will receive plants between 1.25 and 3 inches in height. They will be a random selection from our greenhouse.  Color/Blush is not guaranteed but will be provided when it is available. Blush is an air plant's response to sun exposure or stage of bloom cycle.  Color can be encouraged by sun exposure once you receive the plants. Ionanthas are all the same SUB-SPECIES, so they are going to naturally have a similar appearance.  You are receiving 3 different varieties, even if they look similar.  If you need help identifying the varieties, please send a photo once they arrive.  If you wish to have 3 very distinct looking plants, please consider our other 3 assorted tillandsia pack.
Guess What! A portion of the proceeds from the purchase of this item will go to our monthly donations to the Rainforest Alliance TREES program to support sustainable business practices and responsible collection practices.

            THE DETAILS:
Rose gold jewelry is a staple in any jewelry collection, and these lovely stud earrings are no exception! Rose gold is right on trend, and is a modern neutral that can match almost anything. The earrings feature resin rose gold druzy cabochons set on rose-gold plated studs! Dress them up or down! The earrings come with soft rubber earring backs, perfect for those with sensitive ears!
**IMPORTANT** DRUZY CARE:
Rose gold gets its rose color from the addition of copper. Copper IS susceptible to tarnish. When not wearing the rose gold earrings, It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to ALWAYS store them in the included bag, to prevent tarnish. Also store them on the included jewelry tag, to prevent scratches or damage to the resin druzy.
POSTS AND SETTING:
The setting (metal surrounding the druzy) and the earring post are made of brass, plated with a rose gold finish.
DIMENSIONS:
Diameter of the druzy is 10MM. Including the metal setting, the diameter is 12mm. 
SHIPPING:

This baseball can be personlized with a team name or player name.  If you want personalized be sure to leave what name you would like in the note to seller section.  If no name listed, I will send plain. Order now while supplies last. 
You many choose plain or glitter epoxy for the bottle caps.  The glitter epoxy gives a unique finish that most bottle caps do not have.
BOWS WITH BOTTLECAP PINS ONLY. These bows attach to any flip flops easily with a matching color, elastic. You will receive two bows and 2 personalized bottlecap pins(no flip flops). These bottle caps have a bar pin on the back that allows the bottle cap to be attached to the bow. 
Important note!!!--- Since these bottle caps are attached with pins, they are not recommended for small children. 
This elastic wraps around and hides under the bottlecap, making it more difficult to see. You can use the elastic to wrap around both sides of the toe strap for a middle centered bow(pictured) or you can attach to one side of the toe strap for an off-centered look.  I will send directions on how to attach the bow.  It is very easy.  You will love them!!!
