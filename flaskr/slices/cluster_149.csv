            **Please note: the latest shipment of this fabric I've found to be much more gold in tone than previous bolts, which are more golden yellow as shown in the pictures. Still very nice, but just an FYI!**
This is the bold brother of our popular Sunset Aztec print leggings, in a striking black, white and gold! You will love the sturdy, soft and super stretchy fabric, too!
These leggings are tapered in the leg and the seams are serged for comfort, durability and a professional finish. The waistband is finished with a non-roll elastic. Pattern placement may vary slightly from the pictures shown due to the nature of the fabric.
You can find matching felt bows in our Gemma collection here (Noir, Snow and Goldenrod are perfect for these leggings!):

These are light enough to use for any costume purposes, including earrings!
Please see last photo to view both sides of pendants, cm ruler and dime for visual sizing.
(Black cord seen in photos is not included.)
Some history obtained from Wikipedia:
Kuchis are Afghan Pashtun tribal people, 60% of whom still live a totally nomadic life traveling between pastoral lands in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
They raise sheep and goats and exchange or sell the produce of their animals (meat, dairy wool) and the rustic pendants that you see here, in exchange for grain, vegetables, fruit and other products.
 
A large, busy network of exchange has developed along the main routes annually followed by the nomads. 
Although their migrations were stopped in the early 1960's when the Afghanistan Pakistan border was closed, many Kuchis are still allowed to cross as border officials recognize the Kuchi migrations which occur seasonally and allow them to pass even in times of political turmoil.
I believe that the appeal for these rustic pendants followed the growing popularity of belly dancing and rustic ethnic designs in Western countries, offering the Kuchi nomads a new trade opportunity.

            Stylish and safe: Our cat collars are the purrfect choice for the everyday cat life.
Our materials are carefully chosen to make sure your cat feels comfortable in his/her new accessory. The collar is made from quality webbing and is completely covered with soft cotton fabric. It's very durable, yet light weight and therefore perfect even for sensitive cat necks.
We take pride in our work and sew each item carefully with attention to detail (accurate stitching, no loose threads.) 
–--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
We all know that cats are little adventurers, so of course the collars feature a safety/breakaway buckle. If your cat gets stuck anywhere the buckle snaps open under pressure. The buckle opens when 1-1.5 kg tensile force is applied. Each buckle is hand tested to guarantee your cat's safety.
Important: Breakaway buckles are not intended to be used with a leash.
–--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Add some extra cuteness to your collar with a charm that fits your cat's purrsonality:
http://www.etsy.com/listing/504172019?ref=fcl
(as you need a D-Ring to attach a charm, please choose the „with D-Ring“ option in the drop down menu of the collar listing)
–--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Measurements:
Collar Length: 20-33 cm (8 -13“)
Collar Width: 1 cm (3/8“)
Due to their adjustable size the collars fit normal sized to bigger cats. If you need a kitten size, please let us know in the notes section at checkout and we'll make sure the collar will fit :)
–--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Buy as many items as you like, pay shipping only once! Each additional item after the first one ships without additional shipping costs! Tracking included.
We recommend hand wash. Don't put in the dryer.
Please note: Pattern placement may vary. As each item will be made to order especially for your cat, you won't receive the exact one shown in the photo. But we promise that yours will look great as well! ;)
Colors might be shown slightly different depending on the monitor used.

6299,Curly Q Small Bird Toy Perfect for parrotlets and lovebirds green cheeks bird perch parrot toy,"
            Our Curly-Q bird toy is an absolute favorite of small birds everywhere. Over the years this has been one of our most popular toys.
Super fun and virtually indestructible!
To attach just remove the ends and wind through the cage bars and twist so that the ends don't slip out, replace the ends. We recommend stretching it out enough that there is space between the rings for your bird to weave in and out.
Great for any birdie that fits. The interior of the rings measures 2 and 3/4 inches, it easily stretches to 18"" long and can be stretched farther if desire.
REBECCA says: ""I purchased the curly q a few weeks ago from you, and thought I would pass along a photo of my little parrotlet, Mizu, LOVING his new toy! He has a double door flight cage (a huge cage for a such a little bird, but hey, you gotta spoil them!), and the curly q fits perfectly between the doors. He climbs on top of it, under it, and of course loves running through it!"" (Mizu is pictured with his Curly Q in the third picture)        ",8.99,4.9694,"Handmade item

They are cute and very detailed.  My kids love to sit by the fridge and play with these while I am getting things done in the kitchen.  For fun I googled a picture of a background scene from Peppa Pig and printed it out on the computer so she could have a little play scene to work with!

Siser Glitter is the most popular material for heat transfer applications. It is great for adding some sparkle to every type of product. The best use of the material is for T-shirts. It can be also used on almost every type of garment. It is perfect for sports cloth, company wear, funny T-shirts and anything you can think of. It is very easy to weed, with static and non-pressure sensitive backing. The glitter effects are also great for cheerleading, dance and gymnastics. The glitter is embedded so it is not as hard on the blade.
Our Glitter heat transfer vinyl is the best on the market. Our colors are vibrant, with sandy feel and contain maximum sparkle! Why have a plain design when you can bling it out for maximum appeal? Glitter is CPSIA Certified so that even kids clothing can look amazing. You can also sublimate directly onto Siser Glitter!
The material is compatible with any professional vinyl cutter, Cricut or Silhouette machines. Its features include high washing resistance, hot or cold peeling, easy cutting and weeding. It can be applied easily with iron or with a heat press. The result is the same which makes the material perfect for home use.
The material should be cut in reverse. When applied on the cloth, the backing paper can be used to protect it. Thus no additional material is needed for the application. The thickness of the material is 12.8 mils.

            Hi there! This listing is for 30 cinnamon sticks measuring 6 inches in length.
I have several different lengths of cinnamon sticks in stock. Check out the Cinnamon Stick section of my shop to see if I have the size you're looking for:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cinnamon is primarily used for cooking. It adds great flavor and smell to baked good, Asian curries and desserts. It is one of those spices that mixes well with a variety of ingredient but especially orange and honey. It can be used whole, broken into small pieces so the aroma and flavor comes out or ground and mixed into food like cakes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Common Health Benefit Claims of Cinnamon Sticks:
Blood Sugar Control
Anti-Oxidant
Cancer Preventer
Weigh Reduction
Arthritis Relief
Lowering LDL cholesterol & triglycerides
Alzheimer’s Disease
Helps with colds, sore throats & Cough
Improve memory and alertness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ideas and recipes:
Use it in crafting. Wrap the sticks around a candle, or candle holder. Use the sticks as additions to a wreath. Cut them into smaller sections and place them in organza bags as sachets.
Foot Wash - Got a bad case of Athletes foot? Break 2-3 three Cinnamon sticks and put it into some warm to hot water and immerse your feet in it. Cinnamon has a powerful anti fungal properties that should get rid of your foot fungus.
Add to Coffee or Tea - Break a 3 inch Cinnamon stick and add to your tea of coffee with honey. It adds a wonderful taste and aroma. You break the Cinnamon sticks to bring out it's flavor and aroma.
Mulled Wine - A stick of Cinnamon Cinnamon, especially Ceylon Cinnamon is an absolute must for making the perfect mulled wine. This tasty hot drink is an absolutely fantastic Christmas tradition.
Powdered Cinnamon - In a spice blender, blend a few Cinnamon sticks and use it in recipes that call for Cinnamon powder. Sure you can use store bought Cinnamon powder but good cooks know store bought only delivers only 10% of the power of freshly ground Cinnamon. Besides Cinnamon sticks can be kept for a much longer time, as long as you keep it in cool dark place away from sunlight.

19200,White Henna Cone,"
            White Henna is now more popular than ever, with its striking boldness and sleek finish.
ONE HENNA CONE PER PURCHASE 
The white henna cones are handmade with love from a non-toxic body paint and applied in the traditional Henna style.
White henna is water soluble and lasts on the skin until washed off, making it perfect for weddings, birthdays and festivals. It does not dye or bleach the skin and leaves no mark. Repeat: WHITE HENNA DOES NOT DYE THE SKIN
Decorate your hands, arms, back, belly or feet with any design!
Use this product on clean, dry skin, free from oils or creams. Leave the white henna to dry for around 30 minutes before moving to avoid smudges.
No harmful chemicals, dyes or glues are used to create this white henna paste.
Be sure to only snip off a very small part of the tip for the best results and to avoid a blotchy design.        ",7.30,4.5185,"Handmade item
