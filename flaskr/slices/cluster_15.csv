888,"Neiger Brothers Czech Glass Egyptian Revival-Late 1920's-.75""","
            This is a fantastic pair of Egyptian Revival earrings made between 1920 and 1935 and designed by Max and Norbert Neiger. These earring are composed of Czechoslovakian pressed turquoise glass which is prong set into a Victorian brass base with floral detail typical to the period. Originally these earrings would have been screw backs but the backs were removed sometime in the 1960's and replaced with 14k post backs(see pictures). The earrings measure.75"" and show wear(loss of paint) typical to age.
The story behind Neiger Jewelry is so interesting and inspiring. It is obvious why these designs command such high prices, it is not just the designs but the history of the work.  
Max and Norbert Neiger were two Czech brothers who made wonderful jewelry with figural glass components in Gablonz, Czechoslovakia, in from 1905 to the 1930s. As the Germans advanced near Gablonz in 1939, the two Jewish brothers left their factory and escaped to Bohemia, where they continued to produce jewelry in a scaled-down operation. They were later arrested in Prague and, in 1942, were exterminated by the Nazis at Auschwitz.
Please review the photos carefully and email with any questions you may have prior to making a purchase.

958,Traditional Mexican Earrings -- 197,"
            Classic folkloric Mexican earrings.
I bought these in Oaxaca about 30 years ago.  
20 centavo coins festooned with two rows of teal, dark green, red and clear beads -- with a black-and-red seed in the middle.  The dates of the coins are obscured by the solder for the wires -- I'm trying to figure out when that design was no longer used in silver.
Very festive.
Measure about 1 by 1-1/2 inches (measured from the top of the wire).        ",95.00,4.9559,"Vintage item from the 1980s

            Vintage pair of mid century floral pinch pleat curtains or drapes.  You would use metal hooks to hang these or you can use clips as I have shown in the picture.  
Each panel measures 23 inches at the top of the pleats and taper down to approx. 33 inches.  Each panel is approx. 74 inches long.  
Beautiful multiple shades of green with coral and white.  Nestled in among the flowers is a little cottage.  There is an insulating rubber liner.  
CONDITION:  Overall condition of these are good.  I could not find any stains.  The rubber liner has some cracking in places and some small tears in the rubber liner as well.   There are some thin spots on the fabric.  There are small signs of wear in the fabric in certain spots, but nothing major jumped out at me.  These are of typical wear for their age.  
I have not washed or ironed them.  I could not find any labels or markings on these, so they very well may be handmade.  Please zoom in so you can see how beautiful these truly are!
I have 2 pair of these.  This listing is for one pair of panels.  If you want both pairs, which is 4 panels, please select 2 from the pull down menu.        ",50.00,4.9766,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            Here are 8 Tupperware storage containers in pastel colors.  The colors represented are blue, green, pink and yellow.  Sizing is 5"" x 4.5"" x 2 inches deep.  All are in very good vintage condition with plenty of life left.  All of the lids fit nicely on the containers.  One lid has an edge crack (picture 3), but the lid still fits securely onto the base.  All pieces have been thoroughly cleaned.  The lids represent both the glossy old ones and the newer matt finish lids.

2302,Slide Rule Tie Clip Engineer Tie Clasp Tie Tack gold tone  works functional Japan,"
            I'm pleased to offer this really cool, gold tone, vintage slide rule tie clip.
This 1950s tie clip features an actual working slide rule. Slide rules were used by engineers, mathematicians, and scientists before calculators were widely available. 
This tie clip / tie clasp is 2"" long and 1/2"" wide, and it features two moving parts. It's in goo condition for its age with only minor wear and it actually does function as a slide rule.
This is the original wearable tech device!   It would make a perfect gift for yourself, or that scientist, mathematician, chemist, or engineer in your life!

2358,"Mid-century Modernist Karl Gustav Hansen, Hans Hansen, Denmark. Leaf brooch sterling silver.","
            Oxidiced, solid sterling silver, leaf brooch. Karl Gustav Hansen, Hans Hansen, Kolding, Denmark.
Marks: Hans Hansen  925 S Denmark 134
Measures: 7,8 X 1,5 cm. Weight: c. 12 grams. Roll-over safety clasp.
Clean and simple modernist design. 
Very good condition, with light signs of wear. Tarnished. The pin at the back is slightly bent. No damage.
Hans Hansen (1884-1940) opened a goldsmith shop and smithy in Kolding, Denmark, around 1906. Initially the company produced flatware. Once that was successful, they started producing jewelry. 
The first pieces were designed by Hansen himself around 1931, but the production of jewelry really began in 1932, with a collection designed by Hansen's son Karl Gustav Hansen (born 1914). 
Karl Gustav took over the Hans Hansen Silver-smithy when his father died in 1940. The company Hans Hansen became one of the most prominent silver-smithies in Denmark. In 1992 the firm joined with the Georg Jensen company. (Main source: Jensensilver.com).

2499,Sale -  Hakama - Pants Style - Vintage Japanese Hakama Brown or Gray,"
            Make a fashion statement! These pleated pants are typically worn by Japanese men for formal occasions.
Deep side slits make them ""one size fits most"" with length typically range from 32 - 34"" (that's the outseam (hip to heel), not the inseam!) and are traditionally worn low on the hips. If these are not long enough for you, you can request a custom made hakama.
Colors are limited to dark browns and medium to dark gray and solid and striped versions of each color.  Photos are examples of typical colors - yours will be slightly different.   We very occasionally have other dark colors (green, blue, black or other striped versions) - feel free to inquire before ordering.
The fabric is mostly silk, though the finish might be satiny or a crisp silk, or occasionally a nubby raw silk.  If you have a preference for this, please let us know by convo when you order and we'll do the best we can when we choose from the several dozen we have in stock at any time.
This listing is for the pants style, with a divided pantleg and a low crotch - near the knee. If you wear a kimono underneath them, you must raise the kimono length with a fold at the waist under a sash. Or you could try the skirt style, which we list separately.        ",50.00,4.88,"Vintage item
Materials:  mostly silk with variations on the weave, finish, and sheen, sythetics and blends are possible

            Barbed wire.  Twelve feet of rustic, old, gnarly (in a good way), barbed wire to be used in craft projects and decorations.  Barbed wire art and sculpture.  It will be shipped in either one 12' piece or two 6' pieces.   
I'm guessing on the years according to when the house was built, but it is definitely old.  Let me know if you would like to buy a smaller amount.  :)
See my Pinterest board on barbed wire for some ideas... 
www.pinterest.com/naturescraftsup/barbed-wire-decor-ideas/
*******SHIPPING FOR THIS ITEM:  Because of the weight of the wire, I had to put a higher shipping cost to cover (almost) long-distance orders but if you give me your zip code, I can figure the exact cost for you, but I have the following guarantee anyway....
ACCURATE SHIPPING COST GUARANTEE:  I'll do my best to keep shipping costs as low as possible, but it is hard to always know what to charge, specially given distances; so I will refund anything that is more than 1.00 over what the actual shipping cost was.  :)  You can shop with confidence knowing you will not be overpaying for shipping.

            DESCRIPTION:
SPECIAL: Use coupon 104YOU and receive 10% off. Limited time offer.
Absolutely charming vintage Luana Shell Double Horn Pendants.  Each one is a slightly different in color and size . The bail is a brass band with a ring attached.  These can be worn as pendants or make matching earrings.
I found these in an old warehouse in Arizona. The warehouse itself was vintage (lol), but inside I found pallet after pallet of vintage beads, charms, necklaces, earrings, and about anything else you could image. Many of the items in storage are at least 30 years old and some even older.  I have purchased a large amount of the contents and will be listing them, so if you love beads and you love vintage, keep an eye out here.
NOTE: Some of the jumprings may have fallen off over the years but I have included them in the package. These are Vintage and have been stored for over 30 years so there may be some patina or age wear. I try to inspect each piece, but once in a while one may slip pass me and I apologize in advance for that. If you have any questions regarding the item please convo me prior to purchase.

*********************************************************************************50% OFF ESTATE SALE!
I am thrilled to announce a special estate sale, on now.  This week, I was fortunate to acquire the estate of a long time antiques dealer and picker.  This lady collected and kept everything!  There are tons of saleable items and lots of supplies and odds and ends, mostly old.  In addition, I have also acquired the inventory of an Etsy customer who has become a friend.  She is closing due to her health and I will be selling off her remaining inventory including many items she had not yet listed.  She was branching out and so there are many surprises in her boxes.
However, with the good news, comes the bad, at least for me!  My storage is full and the house is overrun with stuff.  Yesterday, we briefly lost the cat.  After we found him, asleep in a box, my wife suggested a serious sale, well she kind of insisted.  Apparantely, at worst I am a closet hoarder and at best, I have no self control and cannot say no to a deal. So, my loss is your gain.  Effective immediately, all of my shops are having a drastic sale.  I don't know how long it will go on, probably until I can see the floor in most of the house.  All items, existing and new, will be included.  I will be adding items to all of my shops regularly, I kid you not when I say there are THOUSANDS of items to add. Please check back regularly and have fun while I list as fast as I can!

Vintage Disney Poster Print, 1977, Petes Dragon 108  11"" x 14"" Frameable Picture, Wall Art
This is an actual frameable poster from a vintage Disney poster book, not a reprint or reproduction. It has vivid colors on a good quality, heavy and glossy stock. The poster measures a large 14"" x 11"". The back may be blank or have unrelated print or another image.
The second photo can be enlarged by pressing zoom. The last photo shows framing ideas.  (Frames and mats not included, this listing is for one, unframed print.)
 This page measures exactly 11 x 14, and so would fit into a readily available standard frame.  You could pop it right into one as it has an attractive border around the vivid and colourful image.  You could also use it in a standard 16 x 20 frame with a mat.
  It is in very good condition.
*********************************************************************************************************
The first photo is the full print, the second can be enlarged, and the last is an idea for framing, (frame not included).  Print will be properly protected for shipping and ships flat worldwide.
I have a variety of great  prints and posters to post.  These would work well in pairs or multiples or for a gallery style wall.  Please feel free to mix and match and take advantage of the combined shipping discount which will be automatically applied during the checkout.

4154,Vintage Genuine Leather Hand Tooled Purse Made in Mexico,"
            This is a genuine leather hand tooled purse made in Mexico, labelled Naitan.
The purse is in good vintage condition. The shoulder strap is adjustable and has some wear, but is still nice and strong. The embossed pattern is beautifully designed, flowers on front, and a beautifully intricate design on back and scrolling leaf patterns on the sides and underneath. Leather strap fits into front slot to close.
Inside zippered compartment zipper works well. Three compartments as well as the zippered slot and a smaller one in front of that.
There is some wear underneath, and some white scuff marks on front (see picture). Also has pen marks on the fabric inside. Price reflects flaws.
Really great retro handbag.

4240,Vintage Solid Metal Gold Purse Metal Purse Case Purse Gatsby Evening Bag Gold Bag Gold Evening Bag Handmade Bag Art Bag,"
            Gorgeous solid metal handmade purse. This bag is so unique with all the intrigue of a hand created piece of art. Obviously a lot of work went into hand soldering and scoring the sold metal that created each side of the case that make up this purse. The sides are scored with thin horizontal lines and the ends feature a suns with rays. the purse is hinged at the bottom and closes with a long curved metal clasp. The shoulder chain is soldered on as well. The purse is lined on the inside with a brown felt. Because the purse is solid metal it is on the heavier side but well worth weight for the conversation starter.

4244,Doctor Bag - Gladstone Bag - Antique French Leather Doctors Handbag - Vintage Boho Handbag - Medical Bag,"
            I saw this doctors bag at a Vide Grenier (like an English ""car boot"" sale or an American ""garage sale"") in the nearby village of Maillezais. The vendor, an octogenarian Madame, informed me it had been her late grandfather's working bag and she proudly proclaimed that many a malaise had been cured by its contents being sagely administered by him whilst ""on his rounds"".
It is made of leather, opens and closes easily, and  apart from the catch there are also  two sliding brass plates on either side of the handle which act as locking devices should one wish to ensure the security of the bags contents whilst walking about, as inevitably a doctor would. Its interior is fabric lined and in the condition one would anticipate of a bag with more than a century of usage.

4708,"large silk shawl with fringe, cream silk shawl, tasselled shawl, gift for her, wedding shawl, silk jacquard scarf grape patterned silk scarf","
            This is a vintage wedding shawl made from light taupe or beige silk with  woven grape pattern. This is a heavier weight silk, gleaming and smooth to the touch. 
This design dates to 1930s, but it was in production for quite a while. It was produced in Russia, at the Sverdlov Silk Weaving Manufacture in the town of Pavlovo Posad; designer's name was Korenkov. The shawl's name is ""Grapes"". 
It was stored in someone's chest for all these years. Does not look like it has been worn. 
The shawl is square, about 45 x 45 inches (114 x 114 cm), not counting the fringe. 
NOTE: It does not have stains or tears, but there is at least one spot where fringe is broken. Not easy to see. 
Dry clean (preferable).

4748,Antique Eyeglasses Oval Lenses Scroll Bridge Spectacles Magnified Glasses 1800's Eyewear Accessories Reenactment,"
            This is a wonderful pair of antique, oval, scroll bridge eyeglasses.  These most likely date to the 1860s-1890s. They are in very good condition and looks like the lenses can be changed out (not 100% sure but it looks like you could loosen the screw and the lenses would come out.) The lenses are magnified.  They have a scroll bridge and are considered ""ladies"" or straight temple spectacles.  They are in very good condition and the hinges move perfectly and they do not seem to be bent.  They are made of sturdy metal.  There is a little wear on the nose piece on the inside; other than that not much wear at all.  They measure 4 3/8"" across and the arms are 5 1/4"" long.  The nose piece measures 7/8"" across. The length of the glasses hinge to hinge is 4 7/16"". The horizontal measurement of the lenses are 1 3/8"" and the vertical is 1"". These are a really cool pair of antique eyeglasses!

5828,"Vintage Bellini Ladies' Hat - 1960s, Bollman Wool, Green and Yellow","
            What. A. Statement. 
This gorgeous Bellini hat screams 1960s. It's a heavy wool felt in a bold, deep green with an equally bold mustard yellow trim. The interior stamp reads ""Doeskin Felt - 100% wool - Made in USA - Bollman Hat Co."" The label reads ""Bellini - New York."" 
The hat features a wide upturned brim with a medium-size crown. It's all in very good vintage condition - I found two spots on the underside of the brim where there's some dried glue residue (photo 5), but other than that, I can't find a thing wrong with it. It's also very heavy, and the bow makes it lopsided - you'll definitely need to anchor it in place! 
On the right is a large matching bow with rhinestones down both sides of the center - no missing stones, and they're all held in with prongs. Did I say large? The bow itself is 10"" long and 6"" wide at the ends. 
Measurements:  14"" from front to back, and 13"" wide. It measures 21"" in circumference at the grosgrain ribbon - BUT, it fits MUCH larger than that. Most 21"" hats fit me okay, but this one is way too big. If you wear more of a size 23 or even a 24, this is probably closer to your size. The crown is 4.5"" tall; the brim is 3.5"" wide. 
Because this is heavy and oversized, it will cost a bit more to ship. Overseas customers, please convo me for a shipping quote. :) 
I'm happy to answer questions, provide more photos, and combine shipping on items. Thanks for visiting!        ",50.00,4.8413,"Vintage item from the 1960s

6022,Bunny Rabbit Box Hay Feeder,"
            Bunny Rabbit Hay Feeder Box
A rustic wooden box that holds up to two bags (depending on size) of your bunny's favorite hay mix. This box is specially made to sit next to your bunny's litter box so they can eat hay while sitting in the litter box. The bottom of the three holes are 6.5"" high so that your bunny will have easy access to the hay. Reduces the amount of wasted hay by containing it in this box rather than tossing out hay as you change out the litter box.  Our bunnies started using the box right away and love when we add dried apples and carrots to search for in the hay.
The boxes come in natural color or any the color options shown in the pictures above. We use bunny-safe dyes on our wood.  Slight variation may occur, depending on the grain and coloration of the wood. Lid has two hinges and a lip on the front for easy opening and refilling. 
Wood:
Kiln Dried Pine
Color Options:
Natural Bunny
Bunny Bouquet Pink 
Citrus Lime Bunny
Aqua Bunny 
Box Size:

Available in a wide range of colors, patterns and custom orders, this one is in the solid colors listed.
The SLINX was originally made as a soft ""Front Pack"" Sling for carrying your pet.

At last a product created for you and your cat, dog, or whatever you wish!

Easy to use, ties on like an apron.  
This is the SLINX Basics Sling:
Long 1.5 foot Stretch straps to tie many ways through side loops
Large top opening with tie strap on one flap.

Reviews:
Bethany M.-We LOVE our SLINX! If anyone is thinking about getting one.....get it! It's worth it & the naked babies LOVE it. My babies just sit in it & purr away.
Shaynna S., Australia-""We LOVE LOVE LOVE the SLINX! I pulled it out last night and put it on the lounge, Jacques immediately checked it out and crawled inside and curled up for a snooze. As I type now he is passed out in it. It's perfect, soft, comfortable, and fits/sits so well.  You're right about the leaving it hanging about- since Jacques was curled up in it last night I just picked him up and took him to bed in it.""  
Alum A.-""It sure is made for sphynx because one of mine climbed right in. The other one is intensely curious but keeps getting swatted at to stay away by my big boy who is sitting in the slinx right now. He's the one who loves sitting in my shirt.""  ""He (my husband) refers to Thermo as ""his son"" and demanded that he needs to wear the Slinx""

The wreath would look wonderful indoors or outdoors but if hanging outdoors,  I would recommend hanging the wreath away from direct sunlight or harsh weather to help preserve the berries.
Although we recommend hanging indoors, some like to put the wreath outside in a protected area.   You can add additional protection by choosing to have UV Protectant Spray put on your purchased wreath before shipping.

9447,the SoulSpace Oracle deck,"
            This 60-card oracle deck is adorned with prints of luscious, intuitive, watercolor paintings embellished with white and black ink, each offering a soulful word for contemplation. The backs of all cards show a gentle, warm, pastel watercolor wash, visible in the last two photos in this listing. The 61st card in the deck is simply a title card, as seen in the photos above. 
All cards are packaged together in a convenient custom-printed, shrink-wrapped box for safe-keeping, which also details ideas for ways the cards can be used. The front and back of box can be seen in photos in the listing. All art was made by me, Jen Berlingo. 
These cards are ""tarot sized"" or 2.75"" x 4.75"" and are printed upon the finest quality, smooth, non-glossy, German card stock with black core to prevent transparency. 
Select cards from this deck are printed onto greeting cards. If you'd like to check out the art work in more detail, see the greeting card listings:

Answer to the most common FAQ: 
In Spring 2016, I sold the original SoulSpace Oracle deck on Etsy, which only contained 30 cards. This deck includes all 30 of the original cards PLUS 30 additional cards, for a complete 60 card deck.

Ideas for using your SoulSpace Oracle deck:
If you’re seeking a quick, fun, and meaningful way to look inward, working with oracle cards could be an enriching practice for you. The simple act of choosing a card (or a few cards) is an immediate way to invite self-reflection, whether you are starting your day, seeking insight into a lingering question, or invoking nighttime dreams. In meditating upon the image and message of the cards you draw, meaning arises your insights, associations, and inner wisdom. You don’t need to be a professional tarot reader, a shaman, a believer of woo-woo, or anything other than exactly who you are to make oracle cards part of your practice. 
Times you might consider drawing a card:
• At the start of your morning
• To set intentions for your day or week, placed upon an altar or around the house as visual reminders
• As creative writing or journaling prompts
• For help in answering a question you're pondering
• Before bedtime, to close your day or invoke/inquire into your nighttime dreams
• To mark special occasions, like your birthday, new years, or the beginning of a project
• To mark a transition, like a move, a new job, a birth, a death, a relationship beginning or ending
• If you're a healing arts practitioner, teacher, advisor, or work alongside others in any capacity, consider keeping SoulSpace Oracle cards on your desk to invite clients or coworkers to pull a card at the begining of a session or meeting to arrive into the sacred space and set the tone for the session
Prompts you can use when pulling SoulSpace Oracle cards:
Drawing 1 card, you might ask for insight around a particular topic, or ""What energy do I need to bring into the day ahead?""
Drawing 3 cards, you might ask one of these sets of questions:
• Who was I? Who am I? Who will I become?
• Where was I? Where am I? Where am I going?
• What am I keeping private? What am I showing to others? How are others
seeing me?
• What am I heading toward? What is in my way? What tool can I use to
overcome that obstacle?
Other uses for your SoulSpace Oracle deck:
• Tape an inspirational word to your bathroom mirror, computer, or car dashboard
• Send good vibes to a friend by finding a fitting card and writing a note on the pastel card backing
• Leave a card for a stranger under their windshield wiper or near the cream & sugar at your favorite cafe
I hope the SoulSpace oracle brings you joy and light. xo, Jen

10048,Dungeons and Dragons Dice Box,"
            This 4x6x2.5 inch birch plywood box is designed with the DnD gamer in mind. They are the perfect size for multiple sets of polyhedral dice, your character mini and any tokens. (You can fit over 100 standard Chessex dice without minis or other items.)
The quote reads: ""Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and taste good with catsup."" I realize some folks prefer the spelling 'ketchup', you can request that at no charge but need to mention it when placing the order.
These boxes COME WITH up to three lines of text on the back, or a name on the front, or both! <NO EXTRA CHARGE.
You will want to send us the spelling and location when you order, and we will send you some really fun fonts to choose from! You will get an image mock up of any changes before the item is lasered, so look for those email requests please. 
The boxes come lined in felt to keep your lovely dice all shiny and safe. Your color choices are listed when ordering, please make sure you pick one.
The box components fit together nice and snug but there are earth magnets, precision sunk on the lid and lid shelf to keep the box closed nicely. Because they are made with plywood, they are sturdy enough for tossing in a back pack and frequent use.
We seal these with a wood wax rub down before they leave. They will smell like that for a short period of time. It helps keep them safe and the lid sliding smoothly. :)  Because they are made with wood, they will have very slight different coloring or wood striations. This is normal. 
**NEW**  Each Dice Box will be shipped inside a FREE lovely purple bag of holding. (Crown Royal Bag) as added cushion and storage.

10260,"Giant Jenga inspired - Texan Towers - w/ optional carrying tote - 54 pieces - sanded and planed wood pieces for smooth game play - 7.5"" pcs","
            Texan Towers is a great game for your next tailgate, summer picnic or when you want a fun lawn game to play.
Typically ships in 1-2 business days!
Each game piece is run through a thickness planer on all four sides and then sanded smooth!  No risk of splinters!  Other sellers talk about how their games are sanded to be smooth.  That's great, but I go one step further!  By running each piece through a thickness planer (on all four faces), the pieces are much closer to uniform thickness which is key to game play.  It's still wood and the pieces aren't perfect and they may expand with moisture in the air, but this significantly reduces the variation.
This game consists of 54 individually hand cut pieces of wood.  I used 2x3's and ran them through a planer and then a sander so they would be smooth enough for game play.  Each piece is 7.5"" long and the tower is 27"" when game play begins.  Then the height grows from there when game play begins!  
The carrying tote can be added to your order for an additional fee.  The standard price includes a tote with the Texan Rustic Elements logo.  You can also select the upgraded tote which can include a custom message or image.
Thanks for checking out my listing and have fun playing the game!
<How to Play 
The game is typically played with 2 or more players.  First build the tower stacking the pieces as carefully as possible.  Then take turns removing a block (using only one hand) and place on the top. The object of the game is to be the last player to successfully stack a wooden block without knocking over the tower.        ",50.00,4.9796,"Handmade item

WHAT ARE FLATCATS?
FlatCat's are no-hum, noise-free, full-power guitar pickups... but they're only 1/4"" thick and are mounted on the surface of your guitar.  Easy-to-understand installation instructions are included with the pickup.  
FlatCats work with standard electric guitars, cigar box guitars (CBGs), folk guitars and other instruments that use steel- or nickel-core strings.  They produce especially fine tone and sound range.
FEATURES:
* Unique design eliminates pickup-generated hum and noise
* Only 1/4"" thick but all the power of a full-size pickup
* Mounts on the surface of your guitar-- no major routing required
* Entire pickup body sits right under the strings, pulling in every bit of sound
* Full-bodied, unique, rich sound with a variety of range
* Available in several sizes to and colors meet your needs
* Fully hand-made custom pickup  
* Customers love it
WHY ARE FLATCATS SPECIAL?
Most pickups are largely buried in the guitar body-- with the primary magnetic field a distance away from the strings. But the entire FlatCat sits right under the strings with the active field totally surrounding both strings and pickup. This produces an accurate, vibrant, rich sound that can't be gained from standard pickups.  
FlatCats are very versatile pickups-- with sounds ranging from mellow blues to ROCK OUT!  They are priced surprisingly low for a  custom hand-made pickup.  Check out my store's Reviews section to see what others say about FlatCats (they're all actual customer reviews, no ""plants"").   Try one-- or two as a matched set.  The sound is simply awesome.
SOME CUSTOMER REVIEWS ON ETSY:
""Fantastic pickup with impeccable design and craftsmanship. Sounds great and is thin enough to surface mount on all the types of guitars I build.""
""This is the second one that I have bought. Excellent output & tone for a flat PU. Great installation, easy.""
""This flat pickup is thin, quiet, and outputs whatever the strings are doing. The resin-potted design is a decided advancement over the use of wax in pickups. This was my first order of a FlatCat-It will not be my last!""
Demo video links are at the bottom of this description area.
UNIQUE SIZE, UNIQUE SOUND
A professional luthier stated: ""This has such a balanced sound. It brings out a full bass end without losing the trebles, and has almost an acoustic sub-tone to it.  It's a great pickup.""  
FlatCat provides a complete balance between the bass and treble strings. On some guitars you pluck the low E string and it just rumbles, and the trebles are faded out or tinny.  FlatCat brings out all of the strings evenly, applying proper bass to the wound strings and volume to the trebles without sounding tinny in the process.  The result is a harmonious balance between all strings.
Moderate the volume and tone and you have the mellowest of blues.  Crank the volume and FlatCat can really romp.  
TOTALLY HAND-MADE
Each FlatCat™ is individually hand-made with great care.  The pickup is potted and encased in solid PolyResin (incredibly tough stuff).  The proprietary FlatCat design eliminates the hum you get from single pickups.  
The FlatCat is surface-mounted to your instrument. Rather than needing to route or carve a hollow for your pickup, all you need to do is mount it directly over the existing pickup hollow or drill a small hole for the wire. You can even add one to a single-pickup electric guitar without having to re-route the body.  Full instructions are included for multiple mounting techniques.
MAKE IT YOUR OWN
FlatCats come in several colors, or can be painted and decorated to your preference.  The body is made from sturdy poly-resin, presenting an excellent canvas for your own personal touch.  (Choose one of the ""primers"" at ordering time for a ""do it yourself"" finish.)
Gold Foil is a laser-etched 24k gold finish.
Color Chart note:   The colors shown are actual photos of our finishes.   Individual pickups may vary in appearance. 
SIZE DIMENSIONS:
FlatCats are approximately 1/4"" thick.  The available styles are:
* CBG (Cigar Box Guitar).   2"" x 2""
* FULL SIZE:  3 3/4"" x 1 7/8"".  Same size as standard humbucker with a mounting ring. 
* SPLIT BASS PAIR:   two 2""x2"" pickups designed to focus on 2 or 3 strings each.
You can use one, two or three FlatCats together... or add one to your existing pickups  (Please add a comment to your order if you're using them as a set so that I can configure them for you.)
Stratocaster note:   FlatCats can be mounted on the neck or mid position of a Stratocaster.  
*** FREE SHIPPING within the primary U.S. on all FlatCat orders. ***

INSTALLATION
FlatCats are usually installed using either double-sided tape (included) or a dab of silicone glue at each corner.  Other easy-to-follow methods are included in the full installation instructions.  You can usually simply remove the current pickup and connect your FlatCat to the existing wires, or if not replacing an existing pickup just drill a small hole or two for the wires.  FlatCats are generally far easier to install than standard pickups.  
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me here and I will be happy to assist you in ordering the correct FlatCat for your needs.

Do you have the heart of the truest believer? Do you believe in True Love? Do you like stories with a happy ending?
I am a graphic designer and I wanted to create a real story book based on the one Henry cherishes so much. It contains the fairy tales in their original versions by The Brothers Grimm, along with images of the characters from OUAT's Enchanted Forest. 
Within its pages you'll be charmed by the classic, original story versions of: 
• Snow White
• Cinderella 
• Red Riding Hood 
• Rumpelstiltskin
• Hansel and Gretel
• Beauty and the Beast
• Jack and the Beanstalk
• Pinocchio
It is illustrated with images from seasons 1.
This is a hand-made book inspired by OUAT's story book given to young Henry Mills by Mary Margaret, aka Snow White. It is an original hand-stitched, hand-crafted storybook.
This is an all paper product. The pages are hand-sewn and then glued together using a Perfect Binding method. The covers are printed on glossy paper and then wrapped around poster board.  
The full size 11"" wide x 8.5"" high; 56 pages (counted both sides). It is not as large as the one seen in the series. The inner cover pages are colored texture paper.
Also available in a mini size:

            If you order this book to be PERSONALIZED with your child's name, please be prepared to send me your child's first name when you place your order. Many forget to do this and I cannot begin working on the book until I have this information. Then I spend time sending messages, emails, and eventually a written letter to your home trying to acquire this one piece of information. (Please read further about my policy on this issue in this listing.)
Now comes in Blue also! See listing:

Are you ready to begin a PECS picture schedule with your child, this book is just perfect. You can use this book to schedule your child's entire day from WAKE UP to GO TO SLEEP. There are some duplicates in these PECS. This is because you need to set up this book in advance and your child may do some of the same things more than once like eat, wash hands, go to the bathroom, etc.
Choose from: 
1) Boy (boy oriented and unisex symbols) 
2) Girl (some girl oriented symbols)
ALSO, You may PERSONALIZE the book with your child's name if you wish. When you order, you will be able to send a note to the seller, please type your child's first name to be placed on the book. Or you can send me an Etsy message.

If you want to do that, please select that option and then SEND ME THE CHILD'S NAME when you order under NOTES TO SELLER. Then I can begin working on the book. I cannot work on the book until I have this information. If you DO NOT send me the name at the time of order, I will contact you as a reminder through Etsy mail AND an email. If I DO NOT receive a response  within 5 days, I will send the book without the name on the cover and no refund will be given for the difference since I have spent extra time trying to contact you instead of being able to work on the your book. I WANT TO SEND YOU THE BOOK YOU ORDER, SO PLEASE SEND ME YOUR CHILD'S NAME WHEN PLACING THE ORDER TO AVOID THIS. 
IF YOU WANT TO *CUSTOMIZE* THE SYMBOLS FOR THIS BOOK PLEASE READ FURTHER****

11583,"Vogue's Book of Etiquette 1948, Etiquette Book, Reference Book, Wedding Planning Book, Vintage Vogue, Gift for Bride, Manners Book","
            Vogue's Book of Etiquette by Millicent Fenwick from 1948. This charming, 658 page book covers everything from manners in general and divorce to clothing for men, women and children. It has an extensive section on weddings. Much of the advice is timeless, some is timeworn. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable and sometimes very entertaining read.
The condition is very nice for its age. There is no dust jacket, the cover is a bit dusty front and back and a couple of back pages are starting to split from the binding.Also, the pages are tanning. Otherwise, the rest is in very good condition, no bent pages.
The book is about 7"" wide and 10 1/4"" high.
If you would like additional photos or information, please ask. Book will ship Priority Mail.

This very elegant Lariat Back Necklace is perfect for that special occasion.   This has a delicate a round CZ in the front.  Gorgeous! 
Materials:
   ✦   Gold Filled or Sterling Silver Chain  -  Shown at 26"" with a 6"" drop (No Clasp)

   ✦   Cubic Zirconia Round Pendant - (Gold or Silver: see photo #5) (front) 6mm
    ✦ ✦How to measure for the correct fit for your dress  ✦ ✦
You may need another person to help you with this and I suggest that you have on your dress if possible.  Use a cloth measuring tape or a string and a ruler.  
You will need to do two measurements.  
1)  Necklace measurement  
The front will be a choker so place the measuring tape at the base of the front of your neck.  Then measure the back to see how low you would like the necklace portion to fall.  Make sure it fits easily over your head as there is no clasp.  Also take into consideration your hair if you are getting it styled.
2)  Drop measurement
The drop will include the set of 3 cz's at the top, the chain and the cz at the bottom, so I will need the total.

Album design with the Tree of Life is ""an important symbol in cultures and faiths around the world, The Tree of Life links the heavens, the earth, and all that is hidden and growing below. It seemed only natural to adopt it for pastoral counseling and learning programs promoting spiritual, creative and personal growth for people of all faiths and beliefs. A tree also bears seeds or fruits, which contain the essence of the tree, and this continuous regeneration is a potent symbol of immortality. It is the fruit of a tree that confers immortality in the Jewish creation story.
The Tree of Life is a universal symbol found in many spiritual traditions. It symbolizes many things, including wisdom, protection, strength, bounty, beauty, and redemption. This tree is symbolic of the Creator as it sustains creation with its abundant fruit, protection and regeneration. The Tree also represents humans as we too develop roots, strengthen our trunk and branch out to a wider vision of life as we grow. The tree provides provide shelter. Tall and strong, it has deep roots. It reaches skyward. It loses its leaves and grows new ones …bears fruit …gives shelter. With nurture and care, it lives for generations.

I offer a standard size chart. But I still recommend you measure your child first for ""accurate"" measurements. I am not responsible if the size you purchase does not fit, as you know not all kids measure the same due to height and weight. If you need a size not listed send me the length measurement for a quote.
MEASURING INSTRUCTIONS: 
CHEST: Measure around the torso, under the arms.
LENGTH: Measure from the armpit down to your desired length (mid-shin, ankle or floor). If your child measures differently from my chart please purchase dress according to length needed and leave chest measurement in the note section during checkout. 
*** Tea length is to mid calf, Full length is to the top of the foot. ***
Measurements: 
0-12m: 14” tea length – 16” chest
0-12m: 16” full length 
12-24m: 18” tea length – 18” chest

NOTE: Most of my dresses are made with rhinestones and/or sequins or other small embellishments that could pose a choking hazard to children. If you choose to order please supervise your child. I cannot be held responsible for any incidents that may occur.
My tutus are made in a smoke free/pet free home and shipped in a box to help conserve the fluff. Feel free to message me if you have any questions.

            TWO OUNCE  BAGS,  COE  96,     2oz = 56 grams,    Sold by weight, but roughly 140 pieces 
Best value on etsy!  I am now selling them as 2-ounce bags with flat rate shipping of 3 for the first bag and 1 for each additional 2-oz bag.
These glass slices are handmade, for lampworking, fusing or mosaic. The millefiore murrini are from coe96 glass.  Beautiful mix of sizes, colors and internal designs  as shown in the photos.  Mostly flowers, an occasional heart or star. Bright vivid colors.  Use them to make jewelry, small dishes, ornaments, whatever.  They are priced to sell; WAY LESS than online and retail glass suppliers.  You will LOVE them. Other etsy sellers have 1/3 the pieces for the same price per ounce.
Read my feedback to see how well-loved these are. I enjoy using them in warm glass/fusing, too. Thanks for looking and feel free to ask questions. Your millefiore murrine will be packed with care and shipped promptly.
                                                 **  If fusing, these are compatible with COE 96 sheet glass, not COE 90 or COE 104.  **        ",14.00,4.98,"Craft type: Beading, Glass blowing, Glass fusing, Lampworking & shaping, Mosaic making

14628,One Step Crimper - This Cool Tool Crimps and Rounds With Just One Squeeze,"
            These Crimping Pliers Are So Cool! I have been making jewelry for years, but I have to confess, I have never been a confident crimper.....  Getting the crimp pliers turned just right has always been a challenge for me, and crimping tight enough to trust that tiny little tube to hold everything together, what a hassle!  These are easy to use, they take a little practice at first, but once you get the hang of it you get a perfect round crimp with no sharp edges every time with just one squeeze!  I just love these, and I think you will too :)
This Listing Is For One Pair of One Step Crimpers with Rubber Grips, comes with a handy little container of crimps too.

15471,Glassblowing Swivel -Stainless Steel 90 degree Double Swivel - 1/4 inch OR 3/8 inch,"
            1/4"" swivels are now VERSION 2- 55% Larger Bore Airway than Original Version (not yet pictured!)
These are the double sided, Stainless Steel swivels everyone (ok.. mostly glassblowers) have been talking about!   Made in USA, Rochester, MN.
  304 Stainless- will not rust under normal use.  Don't put them in bleach, strong acid, or, I've been told, blood.  (304 is a slightly magnetic stainless, but don't expect to be able to hold your swivel up with a magnet)  This also means the swivel is lightweight.
  Double Sided- 2 swivels in one.  Straight swivels will last twice as long.  If one side does bind up, you have the chance to see that happen, and to catch it, since the other side will be spinning.
  At the bench, since both legs of the 90° swivel, you won't experience torque as you move your piece from one hand to the other..  or whatever position you put your work into.
  The 3/8ths inch swivels are generally used on lathes or offhand, due to their larger size and weight.  They allow for greater airflow, and can alleviate some back-pressure problems encountered with larger vessels.
  These have received Rave reviews from lampworkers around the World:

  If you do not like it, return it within 30 days, for a refund of the purchase price, minus 6.10 shipping.
  These are the same great swivels that Blastshield is carrying.  I am the sole supplier of these swivels.
  CARE instructions:  clean with soap and water every 3-6 months, and immediately lubricate with lightweight oil.  3 in 1 is fine.  This keeps the water from drying, and causing hard water buildup.  If your water is especially hard, wash with rubbing alcohol.  If you've gotten hard water buildup, try soaking the swivel overnight in vinegar.

15617,Heishi Large Hole Bead Ocean Jasper approx. 44 Big Hole Beads For Leather,"
            Large hole Ocean Jasper Heishi beads are dressed in rich earth tones with big holes of  2 and 1/2 mm. Use for 2mm leather and other cords and laces. Heishi's are 10mm and are natural gemstone beads. Each strand, as well as each bead will be unique. Please except some natural pitting which is  normal  for Ocean Jasper.
You will receive a 7.5 -8"". strand of approx 40-45 beads. If you need  more than what is listed, 
please contact me  before you check out for availability and reserved listing.
IMPORTANT NOTE... The only known Ocean jasper mine in the world is mined out and now closed. The rough that is being cut now is what is left from what had been previously mined and is what is left. As they mined the lower levels the rough became less colorful. Whether or not more of these beads will available and how colorful they will be I don't know. My stock is getting quite low. Once the rough that has already been mined is gone there will be no more new product. I have been hearing this for about a year now and every bit of info I have been able to gather leads me to believe that this is true.
 What I have in now Feb..2017 look very much like the picture.
NOTE:
With the exception of a few, my big hole beads have holes that are approx 2 mm - 4 mm. They  are not huge hole beads like Pandora beads. My big hole beads are meant to fit comfortably on 2-4 mm leather. Please read the listing carefully.  Example..A  big hole bead with a 2 mm hole will not fit over over a 3 mm cord. The only exception  is some 3-5 mm soft flat thin laces may be able to be worked through a smaller hole. If you have questions contact me before purchasing.
 Folk Lore says:
Ocean jasper is the stone of high spirits and joy. It opens one's awareness to the benevolent aspects of life and lifts one's mood through its positive vibrations. It helps one to overcome feelings of sorrow, fear and worry and comforts and calms. It encourages the love of oneself and of others. It is a stone that aids with emotions and brings a sense of peace which helps us connect to nature and the earth.
Note: Beads may appear bigger in the pictures than they actually are..
Note: I try my best to show and describe color accurately however I can not guarantee it since color shows differently on different monitors.

17231,"Portugal Antique Azulejo Tile Replica Chandelier Earrings,  Ilhavo - Dove Frescoes from Sintra Palace Chapel - Persian Bohemian Boho Hippie","
            The city of Aveiro is known as the Venice of Portugal because of its canals and lovely hand painted and colorful boats called ""moliceiros"".
The city dates back to the 10th century when it was known by its first Latin name of Alavarium, literally, ""a gathering place or preserve of birds."" The Moors invaded and then held it until the 11th century, after which it became popular with Portuguese royalty. In the winter of 1575, a terrible storm closed the entrance to its port, ending a thriving trade in metals and tiles. The same storm also created a reef barrier at the Atlantic Ocean.
These tiles are located on the facade of a very, very old building in the lovely town of Ilhavo. To my dismay, many old buildings have fallen in disrepair and this is an attempt to preserve a little of the patrimony of Portugal before it's too late.
Deep in the misty mountains lies the enchanting city of Sintra, home to ancient castles, fairy-tale palaces, and verdant gardens. For centuries, sultans, kings, and wealthy noblemen were drawn by the area’s haunting beauty, and they left a trail of opulence and grandeur behind them.
These earrings are replicas of the Frescoes on the walls of the chapel at the National Palace of Sintra! Amazing! See photo!
The earrings are almost 8cm long (about 3"" by 1 1/2"" wide )and lightweight. Czech Glass Beads! 3 oz or 9 grams each
All my tiles are replicas made of polymer clay where the image actually becomes part of the clay through baking. No glue is used in the process. The pieces become waterproof and scratch resistant. Due to the handmade and hand shaped nature of each tile, slight variations will occur, as no two pieces are alike.
Wear a Piece of History!

These boots feature: 
✨ 100% full-grain leather upper (available in different colours) 
✨ Section of vintage, floral, hand-woven, Guatemalan huipil (each fabric is unique so it won't be exactly the same as the fabric in the photo)
✨ Hand stacked, reinforced 100% leather sole
✨ Hand-stitched and welted leather outsole
✨ Zipper fastening and 'lock' so that the zipper will stay done up all day long
✨ Rubber sole protector and grip
These boots are made-to-order especially for you and can be customized as desired. Message me for leather options, photos of available fabrics, or for any other special requests, otherwise we will make them in the same colour leather and with a similar style fabric to the photo.  
These boots are a truly unique purchase, made not only from top-quality materials, but with much love and care. Many of the vintage huipiles took months of work to make, and woven into each one are symbols and stories unique to the region in Guatemala where it was made. There may be a very slight difference in the tone of leather in comparison to the photos, or very small 'imperfections'. This is in fact a mark of the high-quality leather that we use for all of our items and it only gets better with time!

            The Guatemalan Huarache Sandals are traditional Guatemalan shoes, handcrafted from real leather. With their foam sole and woven leather upper, these sandals are breathable, light and soften quickly with wear. You'll find that they become your favourite summer staple and look great with almost any outfit!
Our huarache sandals are of superior quality to many you will find across Guatemala and being sold online. The insole is made of real leather, and the sole and shoe are sewn together, as opposed to just glued (as you will often find!) 
The Guatemalan Huarache Sandals feature: 
✨ 100% real leather upper
✨ Foam sole
✨ Hand-stitched, hand-woven
✨ Artisan made
✨ Also available in dark brown
✨ Perfect summer staple
✨ Classic, on-trend design
✨ Slip-on style
✨ Comfortable and versatile
Each pair of shoes is uniquely handcrafted and no two pairs are exactly the same, so your sandals may vary slightly from those shown in the photos. This type of leather darkens a little as it is exposed to the sun, so expect the colour to deepen to a more golden-tan as you wear them! 
By buying from My Ethical Wardrobe your purchase will be supporting the work and livelihoods of Guatemalan artisans. Our partner artisans are paid fairly for their work, plus a portion of our profits goes into buying new tools for their trade. As the business grows we will be investing more in training opportunities and career development for the artisans we partner with.

            Maroon strappy low rise Brazilian bikini set in a size medium. Comes as a two piece set. Top ties around the back and adjusts around the neck. Bikini runs small. If you are not sure which size to order, always go a size up. Base the size you order off of the size bottom you need, because all tops adjust around the neck and back so can really fit anyone.
Small bottoms fit about a 00-2 in US pants

Large bottoms fit about a 4-6 in US pants
Model pictured wearing a size small. Model pictured is 5'7, 126 lbs, and a 32D.
***Can I mix and match sizes?
As of right now, suits come as same size sets. I can not mix and match sizes, but hopefully will be able to in the future! The tops all typically adjust around the neck and back, so are flexible in sizes. Let me know if you have any further questions regarding sizing.
ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS/REFUNDS.

19477,Baby Boy Boots Leather Baby Boots Native American Made Mukluks Soft Soled Baby Boots Baby Beaded Hightop Moccasins Native Baby Clothing Gift,"
            Handmade Heirloom Quality Baby Mukluks / Boots / High-top Moccasins are made of soft deerskin leather. Are you looking for a different bead color combination? Is there a specific bead color you are looking for. There is no extra charge for bead color changes for this design. Please feel free to contact with your request and I will do my best to honor it.
The material is an incredibly soft supple deer hide that will stretch to fit your baby's foot as he grows. Deerskin is more breathable than cow-hide and vinyl for the ultimate in comfort. The seams are machine sewn for strength and durability, then trimmed and flatten to avoid irritation and rubbing. All of the beads are sewn on by hand with strong durable nylon thread.
Soft soled boots are ideal for babies that are learning to walk, they are able to balance better because they can grip and spread their toes...giving them more control.
These Mukluks are Native American made, and would make a unique one of a kind baby gift...suitable as the next family heirloom.
FOR CUSTOM ORDERS: Please measure the length of your child's foot and add up to 1/4"" to 1/2"" (or 1.25 cm) to allow room for growth. This is your “Sole Length” in the chart below.
PLEASE ALLOW at least 1-2 weeks on custom orders. If there is not a backlog of orders it usually takes me 2-4 days to complete...(please contact me for a completion time).
SIZE                    SOLE LENGTH                     AGE (Approx)
0--------------3.5 inches---(3.89 cm)-----------0 - 3 months
1--------------4.0 inches---(10.16 cm)-----------3 - 6 months
2--------------4.5 inches---(11.43 cm)-----------6 - 12 months
3--------------5.0 inches---(12.7 cm)------------12 - 18 months
4--------------5.5 inches---(13.97 cm)----------18- 24 months
LEATHER AVAILABILITY: Most deer hide bought and sold in the US are from the wild...meaning they are subject to injuries and scarring from thickets, brush, ticks etc. I order only the highest quality hides available...but even then there is no such thing as a perfect hide...there may be slight color variations and texture differences in every hide. I work around these as much as possible to offer you the best looking shoes I can. 
Because deer hides are seasonal...the availability can be limited at times. I have a few reliable suppliers that I work with...that offer the quality that I am looking for. However, because they buy from different tanneries, the coloring can vary. I try to keep the colors as close as possible to the shoe photos...but please when ordering your shoes...choose your leather color from the colors that are listed. The colors in the listings will show the color leather that is currently available to me. I will then make for you a quality shoe with only the highest level of craftsmanship. Thank you for your understanding.
