296,Oshkosh suitcase Green,"
            This is a unique square suitcase. It measures just over 18""x 18""x 8 3/4"".  It is a dark green color with black leather edges. It is a unique, one of kind, vintage find so it has some love added to it in the form of scuffs & wear; particularly around the edges. The clasps work great; however, the key to lock the suitcase is missing. The brand is 'Oshkosh"". The interior is a royal blue. It has ribbons at the bottom to secure your belongings and elastic side pockets. The large pocket on the lid has a leather strap to secure it; however the pocket itself is stretched and sagging (again, more love!). There is also a small hole hear the handle.
Please message with any questions!        ",20.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            Handmade DIY FINDINGS to MAKE YOUR OWN invisible dangle clip on earrings. (non pierced earrings)
TOP QUALITY DIY FINDINGS to make your own dangle invisible clip on earrings. These are hard to break. HOWEVER, please do NOT open or twist them too much, they may loose their original shapes. 🍉 🍏 🍀 🍃🌴  
📪  🏠  Please, be sure that your Full Name & Mailing Address are Correct. Thank you!  📪  🏠
🍉 🌴  ITEM DESCRIPTIONS:  🍉 🌴
••• WEIGHT LIMIT: 4 grams (0.14 oz) on EACH SIDE. Please do NOT hang or connect any jewelry/craft components with the TOTAL weight of more than 4 grams (0.14 oz) to each resin clip. THESE CLIPS MAY NOT HOLD UP ANYTHING HEAVIER THAN 4 GRAMS (ON EACH SIDE). 
••• Available in 2 colors : Silver-Plated or Gold-Plated. Pearls on the back are acrylic Japanese Pearls (ivory color with subtle pink undertone, 4mm each)
These are ready to use. All you have to do is using jump rings  to connect your own jewelry/craft components to these clips to make your own dangle clip on earrings.
🌸  HOW  TO WEAR INVISIBLE CLIP ON EARRINGS? (VERY SIMPLE): 🌸
1] First, please see the 3rd (third photo from the left to right). The MOST IMPORTANT THING is do NOT open the resin clips too wide. They may loose their original shapes. 
2] Spread the resin clips SLIGHTLY ( Just enough to slip onto your earlobes). So when you release your fingers, the clips will snap back into their original shapes and pinch you earlobes securely.
WHAT ARE JAPANESE CLEAR RESIN CLIP ON EARRINGS? 
1) The clip-on parts are made of flexible and clear resin. So they look just like pierced earrings and are comfortable to wear for many hours. (However, wearing them to sleep is NOT recommended.)
2) They are designed to be precise and minimal to fit/hug your earlobes perfectly. As you can see from the photos, these Japanese invisible resin clip-ons are minimal and sophisticated. They are better than the clunky, big and obvious traditional metal clip-ons.        ",6.99,5.0,"Handmade item
