5,"Star Wars Deluxe Probe Droid With Proton Torpedo and Self-Destruct Exploding Head, Power of the Force","
            ""An Imperial probe droid.""
    ""It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here."" 
    ―Princess Leia Organa and Han Solo
The Imperial probe droid was specially designed for deep space reconnaissance. Tenacious hunters and searchers, probe droids were equipped with a variety of sensors, and the ones employed by the Empire were armed with powerful blasters. Upon arrival at their target destination, they gather information and transmit it back to the Empire. If their mission is compromised, these droids can self-destruct. 
The Imperial probes are creepy looking as they slither and skitter along the surface of a planet on their spindly articulated legs. You know you are in trouble if their bulbous sensor ""eyes"" detect you.
This vintage Star War Probe Droid probe is in played in condition. The proton torpedo still fires and the head still self-destructs. Release date: 1996
May the force be with you!        ",5.00,5.0,"Vintage item

            These towels will add an instant unique, bohemian vibe to your bathroom.  Given the excellent condition they're in, they were likely the kind that someone saved for the guest bathroom and didn't get much use, as they're in pristine condition considering their age.  
This listing includes a set of three large bath towels - all an elegant damask pattern and in three complimentary colors - aqua with green, golden yellow with green, and light green with green accents.  As noted, they're in excellent shape, with very few snags or pilling - even the fringe has survived the years well. 
Measurements:
 - each towel measures 24"" w x 40"" l including fringe
 - each are 100% cotton and have original tag still attached to underside

3600,Vintage The Bay - Hudson's Bay Company - Loop Collar Shirt - Medium,"
            ABOUT THIS SHIRT
Very few clothing brands can boast a heritage dating back to 1670!  The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) has its origins in the trapping and fur trade, when the virgin territories of the new world was the focus of the colonial machinations of the old.. ‘The Bay’ is one of the trading names of HBC with the Blue Ribbon label being introduced in 1966 following a re-branding to this visual identity in 1965. The label is not so much of a brand but rather a stamp of approval that was intended for use by non-Company Men’s brand garment items. At the time it was the policy of the Company to attach an approved Company identifier on merchandise where the quality of such merchandise would reflect favourably on or even enhance the reputation of the Company.
Features
*  4 inch convertible loop collar;
*  Double button cuff;
*  Polycotton fabric;

6286,Wacky Swing the Ultimate X-Large Parrot Toy Macaw Cockatoo Bird,"
            The Wacky Swing is the ultimate x-large parrot toy. Pictured with a Greenwing Macaw so you can see how huge it is. It hangs just under 3 feet long. The base is 16"" across. There's enough room for 2 or 3 Macaws. The swing is loaded with tons of bird safe wood and plastic. Lots of different colors, shapes, textures, and sizes to amuse your parrot.
Now for the best part! The Wacky Swing is made with pvc, and the toys are strung on thick chain.You will only have to buy the Wacky Swing once. It's very simple to add replacement parts to make it new again. Also on the bottom of the base there are 3 metal circles. I have 3 small toys hanging on this one. They are included.
This one is sure to be a hit with the big guys. My birds love it. Hope you have lots of room! Weighs about 7 pounds. Hanging link included.        ",59.95,5.0,"Handmade item

            Marble mazes are a perfect sensory game. They are fun for children and adults! A simple but very effective way to keep hands active. A marble has been sewn between two layers of fabric, and a path stitched (tripled stitched for strength and durability) into a maze pattern. The object of the game is to push the marble through the maze path.
This activity encourages
-focus and patience 
-hand/eye co-ordination 
-fine motor skills
-problem solving
Marble mazes are an excellent game to use with children on the spectrum, hand therapy patients, those with Alzheimer's and dementia, those with arthritic hands etc. It is a great quiet time activity that easily fits in your handbag which makes it perfect to pull out at church, the doctor's surgery, restaurants and car rides. 
The marble maze is approx. 17cm x 23cm. One side is a fun, colourful pattern and the other side is a textured fabric - soft minky.
Please choose the pattern/colour you would like in the pull down section when ordering or contact me about a custom fabric choice. 
Items will ship within 3-5 days of receipt of payment. Please refer to my shop policies for questions regarding shipping.
Cleaning instructions: To clean your marble maze simply throw it in the washing machine and let it air dry.

            Bleak House by Charles Dickens, vintage book in brown faux leather.
Rather pleasing copy of classic fiction, you know the one with Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Blessed with a small number of illustrations by 'Phiz' who was given careful instructions by the author. Clothbound printed to resemble leather.
It bears no date but has the characteristics that lead me to be confident it is a 1930s edtion. It has an impressed roundel on the front and a decorative border to the title page.
It has 764 pages and measures 5 x 7.5 inches or 130 x 190mm..
There is a tiny bit of wear to the spine corners and the pages are lightly tanned. The musty pages are a little rippled.

            These beautiful handmade custom cufflinks are perfect for preserving special memories and create a gift with a real personal touch. Memories and photographs are too often forgotten or saved gathering virtual dust on a laptop or phone. Why not make something special out of them? 
If you would like to change the wording or colour at all on the 'Father of the Bride' cufflink then please let me know via a message and I can sort that for you no problem. 
Simply either send me an email or conversation message here on etsy with your chosen photo(s) and I will come back to you within 2 working days with a proof or mock-up design for you to approve before I make it. (If we do not receive a reply within 48 hours on the draft design then we will go ahead and make the order so as not to delay). From then I would allow around 4 working days for it to be made (normally sooner) before being shipped.
► Your Image (if you are personalising using photos):
- We recommend that for best results each image should have up to 2 people only present and due to the small size that they are close together. The glass does magnify the image slightly so both will therefore easily be seen. 
- The closer everyone is in the image, generally the better the results. If you are unsure if your image would work then please message me and I can advise you from there.
- Ensure that you hold the copyright to the pictures that are being uploaded, professional photographs should be only used if you have spoken to the photographer and obtained permission first.
► Size & Material :
• Silver plated cufflink settings, glass domes, sealant and personalised text/image prints
• Size of the image within the cufflinks is 16mm in diameter
• The cufflinks are water-resistant but not waterproof so avoid submerging into water
► Production Time:
• Normally it takes around 2 working days to receive a mockup or proof of your design via an Etsy message
• After agreeing the proof it can take up to 5 working days after this for me to hand-make the item 
• Please always check the announcements section at the top of my store for up-to-date wait times since everything is made to order and busy times such as Christmas can slightly alter this. If you need it sooner then message me and I will see what I can do for you
• During busy periods this can take longer but will state an up-to-date estimate in the Announcements section at the top of my Etsy shop
..............................
How to Order a Personalised Item:
1. Purchase the item using the 'add to cart' function as normal, remember to use the drop down to choose whether you would like any photos to be in colour or black & white if they are used
2. Leave a note in the msg box or message me on Etsy when you check out with your clear personalisation details so we know what to add as text on each cufflink if text is required
You can send us any pictures via a conversation message here on Etsy after ordering
3. If you are unsure about anything please ask us first and we will be happy to help

            Ear Climber - Ear Crawler - Ear Cuff - Silver Ear Climber - Hammered Ear Climber - Hammered Earrings
--- Hammered Ear Climber---
These hammered ear climbers are the perfect choice for minimalists!  The silver has been given a subtle curve to follow the shape of your ear making them extremely comfortable and easy to wear while the hammered finish catches the light beautifully.  
They have a elongated pin back which can be eased away from the front part of the earring to 'open' it to the size you need and then you can pinch the two parts together once on your ear to a fit that is comfortable.
