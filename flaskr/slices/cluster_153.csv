7630,Self-Love Bath Soak,"
            Self Love Bath Soak, 400g
This Orange and Rose petal bath soak is rich in natural minerals to relax your mind and body, flush toxins, ease pain and any discomfort you may be feeling, reduce inflammation and headaches aswell as the aromatherapy benefits of lavender and ylang ylang essential oils to lift your mood and relieve anxiety and nervous tension.
Why we use Epsom Salts; 
Magnesium and sulfate are both readily absorbed through the skin and into the body's blood stream. The skin is a highly porous membrane that both takes in minerals and eliminates toxins every day. Using a powerful mineral base such as Epsom salts in your bathwater creates a process called reverse osmosis. This process pulls salt and harmful toxins out of the body and allows the magnesium and sulfates to enter into the body.
Rose Petals;
The natural oils found in roses help retain moisture in the skin. This results in your skin feeling smooth and soft. The sugars in rose petals especially benefit those with sensitive skin.
Known as a powerful mood enhancer, adding rose petals to a warm bath will help you get rid of feelings of anxiety. Apart from being a detox for your body, it will also help you sleep better.
Orange Segments;
Oranges have been known to help stimulate and even improve blood circulation and its flow through the lymphatic system. This property of orange peel makes it useful for fighting conditions like nervousness, stress, and insomnia. Orange peels also promote healthy skin and prevent blemishes by removing excess dirt and oil from your pores.
Ylang Ylang Essential oil;
Ylang ylang oil is said to work with the cardiovascular, endocrine, and hormonal systems, as well as supporting emotional and spiritual balance. Many of these properties and the potential uses for ylang ylang are those that closely link the body to the emotions or the mind, showing very clearly the mind-body connection and how nature can help our body find balance as a whole. 
Lavender Essential oil;
Lavender essential oil has a calming scent which makes it excellent  for nerves and anxiety issues. Therefore, it can also be helpful in treating migraines, headaches, depression, nervous tension and emotional stress. The refreshing aroma removes nervous exhaustion and restlessness, it is also one of the most beneficial oils in treating acne aswell as acne scarring. Lavender oil will also reduce pain, sore and tense muscles, muscular aches, rheumatism, sprains, backache and lumbago
Nourish and nurture your mind, body, soul with our self-love bath soak.
Add 1/2 cup to your next bath to feel the benefits

1. Bergamot : Uplifting. Refreshing. Euphoric. Spicy citrus aroma with balsamic undertone.

8. Tea Tree. (Ti Tree) : Antifungal, Antiviral, Antiseptic. Great all round oil for every home and first aid kit.
Contents of each bottle: = 10ml.
Bottle:
We now use new recyclable PET plastic amber bottles that will avoid glass been sent in the post. They are pharmaceutical safe. These bottles are impact resistant and can be dropped without smashing. Perfect for using safely in spa and bathroom environments. They can be recycled and have classification PET1. If your item arrives smashed or has leaked in the packaging. Ask the post-person to return it to sender or you should throw it away and contact us for a replacement. 
Usage: 
For external use only, avoid contact with eyes. Do not use on children, or when pregnant or while using medication.
An essential oil should not be used instead of seeing a doctor for medical advice. Never self prescribe and if in doubt please ask your doctor. Do not use on sensitive skin and always do a small test of the oil before use. If an allergic reaction occurs, wash off the oil with soap and water and then seek medical attention.
Never use any oil neat on the skin, always dilute first.
It is best to dilute in a carrier oil (i.e. Sweet Almond, Jojoba, even Olive Oil). Use only 4 drops of each oil on a tissue, in the bath or dripped onto a radiator or sink. The oils can also be placed with their cap off, on a high shelf (out of reach of pets and children) to fragrance a room.  
You might smell the oil before you open the package but this is common with strong oils that have come from an essential oil supplier.
Cap:
A dropper cap is inside the bottle for easy usage, this can be removed if you need the oil to drip quicker. Thicker oils, like Patchouli will take time to drip from the bottle. The cap is tamper evident.
If you are testing a scent for the first time, please do not ask for refunds or leave negative feedback because you dislike a scent.
We are also usually unable to refund open bottles for hygiene reasons. Any damaged bottles will be refunded or replaced.
Use by:
We suggest using your oil within 12 months of purchase. Some will last longer and some scents mature with age. 
We hope you enjoy your essential oils and look forward to your custom.
Thank you.

A Classic Black and White Wedding Tuxedo styled exclusively for Pets.   Tuxedo, Tuxedo Shirt and Bow Tie are made from highest quality “suiting” and “shirting” fabrics.   Fabric, linings and superb craftsmanship will insure the Tuxedo holds it shape and style.   This bandanna styled Tuxedo is made with elastic loops inside, so that it can be worn with or without dog’s regular collar.
Please measure your pet’s neck with a fabric tape measure similar to the way you would measure for a collar (keep two fingers under the tape measure between the tape and pets neck.    Order your Tuxedo using this neck measurement.   We make the necessary adjustment for fit and the Tuxedo will have a 2-3” adjustment at the closure as well.   The ""Length"" refers to the length it will hand down dogs chest.
If you have a breed that has a large neck size, but need a shorter chest size, please note that in the comments of your order.
