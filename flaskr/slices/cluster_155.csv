SCENT DESCRIPTIONS:
ALEXANDER HAMILTON: Recalling his childhood in the West Indes, Hamilton’s scent begins with Caribbean teakwood, tropical fruits & spices, and - of course - sugarcane and rum. Blended with these are masculine notes including leather, tobacco, amber, musk, black tea, pepper, patchouli and sandalwood. Lightened by hints of jasmine and vanilla, the scent is finished off with a touch of - what else? - new money. 
ANGELICA SCHUYLER: Reflecting her qualities of femininity and badassery, as well as her status as the Best Sister Ever, Angelica's fragrance is both lovely and mysterious. Smoky black cherry mixes with sweet crème anglaise, deepened by sandalwood, amber and musk. 
ELIZA HAMILTON: Fit for a character too pure and perfect for this world, Eliza's fragrance is a beautiful, elegant blend of dusty rose, vanilla, cashmere and amber, mixed with a subtle underscent of paper smoke, because Lin-Manuel wants to break your heart. 
...AND PEGGY: Peggy's scent is a sweet, innocent floral fit for the youngest sister. The bouquet opens with jasmine blossoms, blended with other sweet florals like violet and gardenia. These are brightened with a hint of grapefruit, mixed with vanilla and white woods. 
JOHN LAURENS: Laurens' scent is straight-up cinnamon bun. If you don't know why, ask Tumblr. 
LAFAYETTE: Lafayette's fragrance begins with a lush bed of French Lavender, deepened by masculine notes of amber, black myrrh, vanilla, tonka bean, Egyptian musk and clary sage. 'Ow you say? - sexy! 
HERCULES MULLIGAN: In homage to his occupation as a tailor, Kool Herc's fragrance opens with notes of clean cotton and linen brightened by fresh ozone and cashmere. These elements are balanced by deeper, masculine elements of sandalwood, patchouli, musk, amber, and an unexpected touch of chocolate. Blended seamlessly with these are hints of jasmine and white blossoms.
KING GEORGE III: The royal Rickroll of the show, he's never gonna give us up. His Royal Madness's scent is fit for a king: red velvet flower mixed with plum, jasmine and a touch of patchouli. 
AARON BURR: Suggesting the dueling ground on a misty morning, Burr's fragrance includes warm woods like cedar and oak blended with soft florals. Sweet amber, vanilla and musk mingle with the ominous scent of gunpowder hanging in the air. 
MARIA REYNOLDS: Maria walks into Hamilton's life in a hot red dress hiding a scheme cold as ice. Maria's fragrance opens with floral notes of jasmine, spiced up with citrus, patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, musk and amber. Super-sexy and smells like trouble.
GEORGE WASHINGTON: As complex as the man himself, Washington's fragrance includes cherry wood, cedar, tobacco, green fig, vanilla and honey.

-ABOUT OUR SOY CANDLES-
Soy Wax:
· Cleaner burning - no toxins, carcinogens or pollutants which means it's less likely to
trigger allergies. no petrol-carbon soot like you get from petroleum-based paraffin
candles.
· Longer lasting - soy wax burns cooler which means that you can enjoy your soy wax
candle for generally 30-50% longer than a paraffin candle.
· Supports our American farmers (instead of foreign oil conglomerates).
· Biodegradable and water soluable. since our candles are made out of soybeans,
they are naturally biodegradable which makes accidental spills easier to clean.
· Burn Time Approximately 50 hours.
We take pride in our extremely well packaged shipments.

7879,Woodwick Soy Candles Wood wick Candles 100% Soy Handpoured Homemade Candles,"
            100% Soy Woodwick Candles provide extremely long burn times. Our Woodwicks give off a small crackle while burning and burn much slower than other wicks. Each wood wick and candle is hand poured right here on our farm to ensure our customers receive a quality product. Each one ounce of soy provides around 7 hours of burn time. With each containing 8 ounces, that equates to long burn times. Each candle measures 4 1/2"" Tall x 2 3/4"" Diameter
We use no dye, all soy, allowing for a clean toxic free burn. Our candles aren't overpowering with scents, they are an all natural, toxic free, and clean burning candle.
All of our candles are shipped with a cold pack in the summer to ensure the product our customers receive is just like they expect. Generally we add one cool pack per every two to three candles depending on temperature and wrap them in bubble wrap        ",8.25,4.9138,"Handmade item

            Gunpowder Collection:  This fragrance is perfect for someone who loves their guns!  This is a great gunsmoke scent, that reminds a lot of buyers of the Old West. 
* Please keep in mind, this is a novelty fragrance. While I have had many people tell me it has a gunsmoke/gunpowder smell to it, fragrances will always smell different to different noses. If you are not sure this is what you're looking for, I strongly suggest ordering a sample first. Thank you!

FOR NON-UK CUSTOMERS
If you’re purchasing more than 4 JARS please get in touch before placing an order. Otherwise, your order will be kept on hold until a message is received. 
All candles are hand poured and made using the highest quality soy wax, fragrances and inks. Soy wax is environmentally friendly and burns cleaner than other waxes. It is also easy to clean in case you would like to keep the tin. 
Frosting/bloom may occur. This is perfectly natural for soy candles and does not affect the scent or burn time in any way. Frosting is merely an indicator of natural soy wax. 
Each candle is made in small batches so there may be very minor variations in colour and/or scent.        ",7.96,4.8859,"Handmade item

            This is a great value-- You are saving 4 per candle!  Pick 3 of the same scent to use as a centerpiece or to carry a continuous scent throughout your home.  They make a stunning display on a dining room table, buffet, or mantel.  You may also choose 3 different scents, if you prefer, and sample 3 at once.
Choose from the following blends:  Apple Cider, Cinnamon Spice, Cognac and Almond, Fall-a-la-la-la (Pumpkin Spice), Hunka Burnin' Love, Lavender Harvest, Lemon Tea, Old Hippie, Orange Blossom, Pink Grapefruit, Rosemary Mint, Rustic Pine, and Vanilla Chai. If you do not list any scents in the message to seller during checkout, we will send you 3 of our best sellers. 
I blend all of our scents. The majority of each scent blend is pure essential oils. I do add a small percentage of phthalate-free fragrance oils to many of the blends to either stabilize finicky top notes, or to make the blend affordable. Our 100% essential oil blends are: Hunka Burnin' Love, Lavender Harvest, Rosemary Mint. 
We use only quality ingredients. Our soy wax comes from soy beans grown by American Farmers. The jars and lids are made in America and can be used for a myriad of things once the wax is gone. Each 16 oz. candle will burn for approx. 90 hours. These are long-lasting, clean burning candles.
Best of all, you will have a great smelling candle that is a responsible purchase! Buying our soy candles is good for you, good for the environment, and *it helps children in need!

            This is an Acoustic iPhone Amplifier. The cool thing is, you don't need to plug it in and it doesn't take any batteries. Simply put your iPhone in the slot on the top, play your favorite tunes and the acoustic iPhone amplifier will amplify the sound. I was shocked on how well it worked. This would be great to take to the beach, lake, camping, etc. Made to fit any iPhone, just let me know which iPhone you have. If you have a case on your phone, provide me the dimensions(width & depth) and I will custom make amplifier to fit your phone with the case on.

ABOUT THE WRITING / CALLIGRAPHY SUPPLY COLLECTION
Fine letter writing is becoming a lost art and yet, hand-written letters, documents, books & other hand written artifacts have contributed so vitally to preserving all of human history.
Texting and emailing is making most of modern written communication forever lost in cyperspace. This scares Bonnie (and she thinks a host of other people) so she is gradually assembling a collection of fine writing papers and accessories to give you that nice blank canvas and the tools needed to enjoyably keep this art (and your own personal history) alive.
