355,1988 Wacky Winder Big Bird Sesame Street Vintage Kite Spool 300-feet of string  FREE U.S. SHIPPING,"
            This Big Bird Kite Spool is in good condition in its original packaging. It would make a perfect gift for a Sesame Street fan of any age--especially one who likes to fly kites (and who doesn't). Growing up in the midwest, March was the time of year to fly kites and we really enjoyed flying the cheapest super market kites we could find---sometimes, as a special treat, my mom would find a spool of string like this one, that was perfect, because we could stick the pointed end into the ground and leave our kites for bathroom breaks or to run around the yard.

365,"One (1). Vintage, Hand Painted, Japanese Falcon Kite, Circa 1950""s.","
            Up for sale is a, hand painted, Japanese Falcon Kite, that's made from; wood, silk, rice paper, & foam. This kite is 14 1/2"" tall, and the wingspan is roughly 45"". Housed in a cardboard box with rice paper covering. I photographed this kite un-assembled, as it's too large to get a detailed photo in the camera's frame. The wings pivot open from a folded position, and have sliding metal locks to keep the wings assemblies open. They are then ready to be attached to the wooden frame, of the birds body, that I believe is covered in silk, as are both wings. I do not see any damage to this kite, which leads me to believe it's never been flown.  This vintage paper/silk kite is about original as it gets.  I will only ship this item Priority Shipping, with Insurance.     Preferred method of payment is PayPal, or Credit /Debit card.   We Do not sell or ship INTERNATIONALLY, Except to CANADA as of 11/01/2015.

1780,Kuba Cloth Cut Pile Cushion - Vintage Colourful Hand Woven Raffia Weave Cushion - Hand woven textile - organic dyed textiles,"
            This cushion measures 18"" (45 cm) X 18""(45 cm)
We suggest an inner cushion  measuring 20"" (50.8) X 20"" (50.8) to give the cushion the excellent puffed up look.  
This gorgeous cushion cover is crafted from vintage Kuba cut pile raffia which is also known as Bakuba cloth and Shoowa. 
The raffia was hand woven by the Baluba tribe of the Bushoong Kingdom in Zaire which is now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.  
The cloths are woven from raffia palm leaves – left in its natural colour or dyed with organic red, brown and ochre dyes.  It is sewn into appliqué and reverse appliqué. Each pattern is known by name and is designed from memory by the women whilst the men weave the base. The Bakuba kingdom can trace its history back through verbal lore to the 16th century when it is said that Shamba Bolongongo introduced this technique of fabric making to the Bukuba royal court. 
Kuba cloths are the best-known survivors of an ancient African tradition of fine quality raffia cloth weaving that was once widespread across the whole of central Africa.
This vibrant cushion is simply gorgeous compliments all decors.
The Mali mud cloth cushion cover that can be seen along side the kuba cushion  is also available for sale in our shop as are the baskets on the wall. 
Please note that the inner cushion is not on sale - but can be purchased additionally.
The cushions are backed with a brown satin fabric  with an invisible zip closure.        ",126.03,5.0,"Vintage handmade item

            This listing is for 1 jar of BURNT ORANGE Dye.
Extremely brilliant and colorfast, Jacquard’s Acid Dyes are concentrated, powdered, hot water acid dyes that yield the most vibrant results possible for protein fiber. When immersion dying, Jacquard’s Acid Dyes produce a uniform color, which is always a challenge for dyers, and they exhaust extremely well. The colors are beautiful, transparent and luscious enough to dive into.
In addition to yarn or garment dyeing, Jacquard Acid Dyes may also be used for painting or printing applications using steam setting.
Don’t be alarmed by the name–the only acid involved is the white vinegar or citric acid that you add to the dye bath.
- A half oz/14 gram bottle will color up to 2 lbs/.91 kg of feathers, depending on the depth of the shade.
USE ON : Feathers, silk, Wool, cashmere, alpaca, and some nylons 
PLEASE NOTE: If you buy the 8 oz. bottle, shipping will be delayed or back ordered.        ",4.95,4.8827,"Craft type: Hat making & hair crafts, Leatherworking, Weaving & tapestry

14293,"Organic Dye Liquids, Orasol Red, Blue, Yellow - (Contact shop to request actual ship cost for multi items)","
            ----   Go here to see all listings for this material:  <----
https://www.etsy.com/shop/NorthernWestStuff?ref=hdr_shop_menu&search_query=orasol
There is currently only one ""size"" this comes in: 7.5 grams each of Red, Blue, and Yellow, 22.5 gr total.
These are Orasol dye powders that have been pre-dissolved in denatured alcohol.  Powdered dye was added to the alcohol until it was close to being saturated.  It is concentrated and a little will go a long way.  If you feel it's too concentrated, simply decant it to a larger container and add more denatured alcohol.   Be careful with these dropper bottles.  The dye is dissolved and there should not be any solids to clog the tip.  If for some reason the tip does plug up, don't squeeze the bottle.  If the dropper insert pops out, you'll have a mess of very concentrated dye on whatever you had in range.  Use a needle to unclog the tip.
I have 5 different Orasol dyes:  Red G (Red 363), Blue GN (Blue 825), Yellow 2GLN (Yellow 152), Yellow 4GN (Yellow 078), and Yellow 3R.  These particular dyes are now manufactured by BASF and are named Orasol Red 363, Blue 825, and Yellow 152.  The original manufacturer listed Red G as a ""Clear, strong mid shade red"", Blue GN as a ""Greenish blue with best bleeding resistance"", and Yellow 2GLN as a ""Mid shade yellow, broad solubility spectra"".  All Orasol dye powders are very concentrated.
Orasol dyes are 'organic', meaning they dissolve in solvents like acetone, MEK, or alcohol.  They will not work as water based dyes.  They are ideal for liquid resins like epoxies, urethanes, or unsaturated polyesters, but they can be used in many other polymeric systems.  When used in clear resins they give brilliantly transparent colors. They can also be used in stains for a variety of materials including fibers.
They're usually sold as concentrated powders, and need to be pre-dissolved in a solvent before adding to whatever it is you're dying (there are exceptions to this: interesting effects can result from adding the powders directly to some resins).  For the dyes I have:  acetone will work as a dissolving solvent, but low alcohols are better because they're more people friendly and they usually dissolve the powders faster.  They dissolve fine in 91% or higher isopropanol(rubbing alcohol) although isopropanol sometimes does not do well with some polymers.  I use denatured alcohol (which is mostly ethanol) and I have listed some small quantities of pre-dissolved dyes in that alcohol.  Methanol also works great but carries some health risks.
Orasol dyes were originally developed by Ciba-Geigy, which through a number of mergers ended up being owned by BASF in 2008.  The Orasol line of dyes and along with their original names continued to be sold by BASF for a number of years until they were partially renamed a few years later (the ""Orasol"" trade name was kept, mostly).
Orasol dyes are well known because they've been around for over 40 years and because of their superior lightfastness.  The CAMEO materials database (Conservation and Art Materials Encyclopedia Online) says they are:
""...a series of solvent soluble dyes....are transparent, have good tinting strength and are lightfast. They are used in resin, wax, shellac, and epoxy coatings. Orasol dyes are also used in inks, paints, wood stains, fibers and plastics.""
Dyes are different animals than pigments.  They are organically based and are truly transparent.  Pigments are (usually) mineral based and opaque, although degrees of transparency can be had by small particle sizes and low loading percentages.  Dyes are normally much less colorfast than pigments.  UV rays can cause them to fade and/or change color in less than a year if they're in the sun.  Here's a more accurate technical definition/difference between dyes and pigments (past the generalization that ""dyes are transparent, pigments are opaque""):  http://www.colour-index.com/definitions-of-a-dye-and-a-pigment
""ETAD defines dyes as intensely colored or fluorescent organic substances only, which impart color to a substrate by selective absorption of light. They are soluble and / or go through an application process which, at least temporarily, destroys any crystal structure by absorption, solution, and mechanical retention, or by ionic or covalent chemical bonds.""
""CPMA defines pigments as colored, black, white or fluorescent particulate organic or inorganic solids which usually are insoluble in, and essentially physically and chemically unaffected by, the vehicle or substrate in which they are incorporated. They alter appearance by selective absorption and/or by scattering of light. Pigments are usually dispersed in vehicles or substrates for application, as for instance in the manufacture or inks, paints, plastics or other polymeric materials. Pigments retain a crystal or particulate structure throughout the coloration process.""
Orasol dyes are among the most lightfast dyes available and several lightfastness studies have been done and are available on the internet.  An original product brochure of Orasol dyes for printing from Ciba-Geigy is still available online through a research project for restoring fur colors on taxidermy exhibits by the American Museum of Natural History (NY) called ""In Their True Colors"".  The brochure includes CG's original lightfastness testing:
https://intheirtruecolors.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/ciba_orasol_brochure.pdf  
The research project also did its own lightfastness tests (this also includes good general info on Orasol dyes):
https://intheirtruecolors.wordpress.com/2016/02/02/the-dye-is-cast/  
This has info on the actual fur restoration project:
https://intheirtruecolors.wordpress.com/2016/07/06/dyed-fur-samples-part-1/
I'm using the old BASF ""Orasol ABCD"" designation versus the newer BASF designation ""Orasol [or Neptun] NNN"" designation because that's what's on the labels of my cans (where ""ABCD"" is a number or letter and ""NNN"" are all numbers).   That means the Orasol dyes I have were purchased sometime between 2008 and whenever they were renamed ""Orasol [or Neptun] NNN"" (which I haven't been able to ascertain- I'm guessing it would be about 2010 to 2012).  I 'inherited' the dyes I have from a craftsperson who used them in jewelry that sometimes had resin (epoxy) elements and whom I worked with sometimes.
I've used them sporadically over the 3 or so years I've had them (once just within the last week), and they are the same colors they always were.  I dissolved some in denatured alcohol to test them and they were just as soluble as they ever were.  One of the links from the from the above AMNH study discusses the properties of Orasol dyes that are several years old and their basic conclusion was there is no discernible difference.
These dyes are very expensive.  You can't buy them from BASF unless you buy large quantities but there are a couple of places you can get them if you need larger quantities than what I offer.  One place is Kremer Pigments and the other is Museum Services Corporation (MSC):
http://shop.kremerpigments.com/en/
http://www.museumservicescorporation.com/scat/pa.html
I price checked both of those suppliers.  Kremer sells them in 2 sizes, a small quantity (5 gr) like mine and a larger quantity than mine (25gr).  MSC only sells in 1 size, an approximately 60 gr quantity (they are actually sold by volume, but they weigh about 60 gr).  Both places charge a lot for ""shipping"" (most of which would be handling; they are charging labor for dispensing from larger containers [I do not]).
Using Orasol Yellow 2GLN as an example:
Kremer:  5 gr, 12 for dye, 15 flat shipping = (27) 5.40/gr
Kremer: 25 gr, 19 for dye, 15 flat shipping = (34) 1.36/gr.
MSC: 2oz, 60 gr, 13.21 for dye, 16.31 ship, my Zip = (29.52) 0.492/gr.
Clearly MSC is the best value, but you still have to spend about 30 for one color just to try it out.  This is where my shop comes in.  Most of what I sell is intended for people who just want a small quantity for testing or to use for just one or two projects.  I have these in 5 and 10 gram quantities as well as groups of 3 primary colors in both dry concentrated powders and pre-dissolved in alcohol (concentrate).
(The pure dye powders from my shop come out to 1.50/gr (shipped) for 5 gr, 0.95/gr (shipped) for 10 gr, 0.80/gr for 15 gr:  3 colors of 5 gr packages) (My shop's pre-dissolved dyes come out to 0.44/gr for 22.5 gr:  3 colors).
