All of my glass etching is done using a professional sand carving system, not your everyday garage sandblaster.  Each item is designed, stenciled, and sand carved by me, using my artist style glass etching system.  I never etch glass using chemicals, therefore you will be able to ""feel"" the etch in your glass. The appearance of the glass etching will be a smooth, milky white, even finish.  
Candid Nomad specializes in custom glass etching, such as unique glass vases, beautiful crystal items, custom cat and dog treat jars, custom wine glasses, custom shot glasses, custom beer glasses, pilsner glasses, beer mugs, flasks, decanters, and bottle openers.  If you have an idea, phrase, or story for a custom etched glass piece, don't hesitate to contact me.  It would be my pleasure to help you design your customized gift.  
Personalization is also available on any existing or new piece.  If you are in need of personalized wedding gifts, personalized groomsmen gifts, personalized bridesmaids gifts, personalized party favors, memorial items, personalized glasses, or barware, send me your details, and I would be happy to work with you.  Personalized glassware is a great gift idea for any occasion. 
I have many other Sugar Skull vase styles.  Check them out here.

8436,White Butterfly Fairies - Miscarriage gift - Baby loss memorial - Sleeping Angel Gift - Bereaved mum gift - Bereavement Gift - Sympathy Gift,"
            My White Butterfly Fairies make wonderful bereavement gifts for the heartbreaking loss of a baby. They are simple, subtle and unique way to remember and commemorate the life of precious little ones. In times of sorrow, it is difficult to find the right words to express your sympathy to family and friends. These little fairies bring great comfort in the darkest days of grief making them the perfect gift of remembrance. Their meaning will signify more than a card or flowers, last forever and share a lots of love.
These pretty star fairy peg dolls are inspired by how I first explained bereavement to my own children, I told them simply that our lost loved one had gone to the stars. It was a comforting thought which connects religious, agnostic and atheist beliefs. Later, I came across an Eskimo legend stating that the stars are openings in the sky allowing our lost loved ones to watch over us.
Each star bereavement fairy peg doll is my own design, painted and embellished entirely by hand making each little fairy a bespoke piece of art. No two are ever the same. They flutter at 6cm tall from magical fairy wing tip to etherial fairy toe. They are accompanied by the “ A butterfly lights beside us like a sunbeam, and for a brief moment its glory and beauty belong to our world: but then it flies again. And though we wish it could have stayed, we feel so lucky to have seen it.” card free of charge.
Your White Butterfly fairy peg doll will arrive from her flight packed in an organza bag and wrapped in my unique popcorn and Brown Kraft Box packaging. Every single little peg doll lady brings the promise of love, peace and hope to her forever home.        ",12.60,4.9596,"Handmade item

14061,Natural Feather Sampler - Lot of over 100 - CRUELTY FREE - Super Sale,"
            *** Photo is stock. You will receive  a similar variety of 100 feathers. I try to include a fair variety of many types and colors of feathers. Basically I don't want anyone to order this lot only to find one lonely turkey feather! I'm hoping this is a great opportunity to someone to experiment with new colors and shapes and for me to clear out some feathers! 
So many feathers! This is a collection of many beautiful feathers for you to work into your crafts.
There are a little over 100 feathers here. Only the good feathers were hand selected and counted, and slightly damaged ones were added in as extras. 
Assortment may contain any combination of:
Pheasant feathers
Assorted Saddles
Assorted Schlappen
Assorted Hackle
Pheasant Plumage
Turkey Feathers
Wing Feathers
and assorted plumage and tail feathers.
All feathers range from 1.5""-7""
Some feathers were clipped, some were shed, Some were salvaged from birds who died of natural causes or went on to our dinner table, or in the case of the turkey /Pheasant plumage, were taken during hunting season. (farmers gotta eat, too!) No feathers were plucked from live birds.
**Packed with love for safe shipping. You're not going to get a bag of beat up feathers!        ",4.25,4.9709,"Handmade Supply

16101,"Glow-In-The-Dark Ultrafine Glitter, White in Light, Green in Dark, Fine Glow In The Dark Powder With Glitter","
            I did a lot of research with glow in the dark powders and was unhappy with the results until I found this Glitter. In bright light it is a beautifl ultra fine white glitter that sparkles. In the dark it is a glowing light green that also sparkles. 
It doesn't glow as bright as those yellow/green pigments, but the addition of the sparkle from the glitter makes it way more attractive. In the light it is white and it doesn't have that funny yellowish color that most glow in the dark powders do. 
Give it a try with other artistic uses like nail art and paper crafts and I'm sure you'll be really happy with it.
Using Diamond glaze is a perfect way to adhere this glitter without taking away its glow/shine. Diamond Glaze is invisible in resin and also available for sale here.
