            These mini vintage brass tie clips are the perfect accessory for a skinny tie. They are quite minimalistic - they are rectangular in shape and have a light texture on their surface. They are deadstock from the 1960's and are in great vintage condition - there is just minor wear, scratching and discoloration on their surface. They measure 1 1/4 inches long and a little over 3/16 an inch wide. 
These all have a rich patina of their surface, but can be polished to a shiny surface if requested.        ",6.00,4.939,"Vintage item from the 1960s

            One long strand of vintage glass seed beads made for the African trade. Some are Venetian and some look to be Czech. 
(Note: These are the small vintage seed beads, not the larger pony beads.)
Bright colors, assorted solids and stripes, with the occasional white hearts and special shapes..
As I recall, these beads acquired their nickname when bead artist and merchant Carol Perrenoud of Beadcats described them as an affordable beady Christmas gift in an article she wrote in Bead and Button about giving beads as gifts.
* Perfect restrung with a simple brass or silver pendant
* Love so sort these by color, then string a few at a time onto leftover wire links
* Use as spacer beads between gemstones, to keep the holes from chipping
* Very affordable accent beads!
ALL GLASS
Q U A N T I T Y : 1 continuous strand
D I M E N S I O N S : approximately 33"" / Beads are about size 11-0 to 8-0.

            The pendants I am listing were part of a very large purchase that Bonkers For Beads made. They are all vintage Czech or West German and at least 50 years old with some older. YOU CANNOT SEE DEFECTS WITH THE NAKED EYE...THE PICTURE IS VERY MUCH ENLARGED. The pendants are STUNNING!
You will receive 2 vintage Czech TURQUOISE MATRIX faceted glass pendant that measures 18x11x5mm. They are so very old! I have original packages. There may be dust on them as the paper in the boxes are disintegrating.  Some pendants appear to have sawdust in the holes...this will pop out with a head pin. These are very old vintage pendants....they are not perfect....they are more of a rough cut. If you are looking for perfection, these are not the pendants for you. If you are looking for fantastic true Art Deco vintage pendants....they ARE just what you are looking for! 
THIS LISTING IS FOR 2 PIECES
~2 amazing vintage antique floral carved TURQUOISE MATRIX glass pendant:  
~Pendants measure 18x11x5mm which are fairly small (though perfect for earrings!). The hole is at the top center of the pendant and runs front to back. The top of the pendant is carved while the back is faceted with no design..just nicely faceted. 
~Hole at the top center~you will need a pinch bail.
PLEASE NOTE: All of the pendants I am listing are antique and from original cardboard tissue lined boxes that were very dusty so they may need a bath.

2695,10 Vintage Austrian Pressed Glass Heart Beads / Vintage Austrian Pressed Glass Heart Beads // Vintage Picasso Pressed Glass Heart Beads,"
            Size :: 10 mm
Qty :: 10 hearts
Circa :: 1960
Origin :: Austria
These beads are from around the 1960's. They are in beautiful condition, as they have never been used. 
They are a plum/violet purple mottled with a muted red/yellow terracotta and hints of reddish orange. The mottled color will not wash off or fade away. The process in making these beads was to use a gas to create the colors on the molten glass, this is why no two are ever alike in color, although the beads themselves are made in a mold so their size and shape will be identical, which is good for the artist looking for symmetry and consistency when making a line of jewelry

            This goodie bag is full of small pieces of delicate vintage laces.  These are all older laces -- no newer synthetic stuff here!  These laces range in color from white to off white to ecru, and average about 8 inches long each (though each piece will vary).  They are more narrow and delicate than the laces in my larger grab bag.  
Each bag will vary -- you will not receive one of the bags pictured, but a similar bag, that may be tied with a different color ribbon or lace.  The bags measure approximately 4 inches by 3 inches (as packed).  This listing is for ONE bag.

Great condition. There are three sets of velcro at the opening. Two of the pieces are kinda coming off, but they don't alter the integrity of the bag, and ultimately aren't needed. I think someone added them. It looks like a couple small holes started forming on the bottom, but someone loved this bag so much that it has been patched. Such a cute bag!

5150,"Group of 20 early postcards, Business postcards, Advertising postcards, Antique postcards, Postcards with stamps, Stamped postcards","
            Destash supplies.  Early postcards and stamps.
20 vintage postcards.  All for one price.  The fronts are shown in photos 1 and 3.  The backs are shown in photos 2 and 3.  Photo 5 shows the closeups of one postcard.  Use your zoom function to get a closer look at each of the 5 photographs.
2 of the postcards have been used/sent.  Those two have been cancelled.  The other postcards have not been sent.  Some have printed stamps and some have regular glued on stamps.  The postcards are ""business related or plain postcards.  The earliest postcard is from the 1890's and the latest dated postcard is from the 1930's.
Many years ago, I bought these at a local Estate Sale of a stamp collector.  These were a bonus in a box of stamps.  I think the graphics are great and they will be a nice addition to a mixed media project.
Now I am selling all my vintage collections, so they are for sale for the first time.
If you have questions, please contact me.

6213,Male Dog Belly Band - Dogs w Bones n Fire Hydrants (#14),"
            This listing is for one belly band as pictured above. Belly bands are perfect for your male dog at home who marks, has incontinence problems, urinates when anxious, or to bring along when visiting friends or hotel stays for those dogs who like to mark new smells when they visit. These bands are designed to use with a urinary pad inside.
Each belly band is made with a top layer of 100% cotton, middle layer of fusible interfacing, and a bottom layer of soft fleece with a Velcro closure on the top of the band designed to allow for adjustment. All fabrics were rinsed in cold water and machine dried prior to cutting to avoid excessive shrinkage after construction.
I offer a wide variety of sizes increasing by 1 inch increments so you can easily pick a band size that will fit your dog just right. You will find the exact size selection above in the drop down box. 
When ordering the proper size band, measure the exact length of his waist where your boy's ""business"" is, being careful not to pull too tight. Select your size based on your dog's actual waist size. Example, a 14"" waist should order the 13-15 band placing your dog's measurement in the middle of the size ordered. As the size increases, so does the width of the band as well as the amount Velcro that is used for the closure. Below you will find the approximate widths. 
8-11 Waist Bands are approximately 3.5"" wide
12-15 Waist Bands are approximately 4"" wide
16-19 Waist Bands are approximately 4.5"" wide
20-23 Waist Bands are approximately 5"" wide
24 plus Waist Bands are approximately 5.5"" wide**
**If you are ordering a 24 plus sized band, please provide me with your dog's actual waist size in the comment section. 
PUL materials are available as an add-on which will be sewn into the band as a third layer in the middle of the band. You can find this upgrade in the ""Waterproof PUL"" section in my shop. This third layer also gives the bands more stability if you like a stiffer/thicker band. This is especially nice in the larger and wider sized bands.
Zorb materials are available as a washable pad that is used instead of a disposable pad or in the All-in-one Belly Band. They are listed in the ""Zorb Products"" Sections. All-in-one Belly bands use different materials which are designed to absorb urine into the band.        ",6.00,4.9301,"Handmade item

6375,BEST SELLER!!! New Mini size! - UNPOPPABLE Ball - Dog Toy - Durable Dog Toys - Tough Dog Toys,"
            These toys came from genuine desperation! We would constantly buy those 2 - 5 plastic balls at the grocery store on the way out so our fur babies could play with them for a few minutes & not even 30 seconds later the fun was over! But what a fun 30 seconds it would be! 
Then I had this brilliant idea! These balls are UNPOPPABLE! Just being crocheted, they never have a truly seamless surface. There are ""holes"" from stitch to stitch where those little teeth can slip right in without doing damage to the ball itself. 
You can even play tug of war with these without the ball falling apart! It will stretch out some and usually return to its original shape with a little help.
And if anything else It's just a great ball to kick around & has a good amount of bounce to it when you kick it up in the air.
*I wouldn't recommend these balls for heavy chewers. **This ball is not a chew toy!** My boy furbaby is obsessed with chewing things and he won't play fetch ever. He will sit down and chew on it if he can get it away from my girl furbaby. Over time chewing on it has frayed some strings but it still stays together. He also likes to pull the strings like he likes to pull with any small pieces or tags on toys. That's what will actually do damage to these balls. So if your dogs are like Bubba I wouldn't recommend these balls for you guys. 
These amazing Unpoppable balls come in 4 sizes!
Large -  is about the size of a Basketball. (30  4.00 extra s/h)
Medium -  is about the size of a melon. (20  0.85 extra for s/h)
Small - is a little bit bigger than a grapefruit.(Pictured in the first picture with littleblackfrenchie (10  normal shipping))
Mini - is about the size of a tennis ball. (Not pictured (6  normal shipping))
*These balls come in 1 solid color but I am more than happy to do multiple and custom colors.
*Do NOT leave animals unattended with these toys!
Care Instructions: Wash on gentle cycle with cool water & tumble dry with no heat.

6765,"Modern Mailbox Large, Walnut and Stainless Steel Mailbox, Wall Mounted mailbox","
            This is a Stainless Steel and Walnut mailbox measuring 14.5""W x11.5""H x 6""D. I designed this mailbox after the 1950's black mailbox that used to hang on my house. I really liked the way it functioned and it inspire me to design this modern version of it. The wood gives it some warmth while the 14ga Stainless Steel cover protects and creates a sturdy shell. It easily attaches to an exterior wall by two keyhole brackets located on the back of the mailbox. These brackets hang from two round head screws installed into the wall . Screws are included.  The wood is sealed with a exterior grade clear coat  spar urethane finish. No stain is applied to the wood. Interior dimensions are 13.5""W x 10.75""H x 4.25""D.
This is a made to order item so please expect it to ship 3-4 weeks from date ordered.
The mailbox front can be laser etched with names, numbers or graphics. Etching is 20 extra. At checkout please leave a note letting me know what you would like etched. The fill or inside of the text will be left natural in less otherwise specified with a fill color. Normally the laser burns slightly making the etching darker depending on the wood type.
The mailbox cover is available in stainless steel or powder coated galvanized steel in black, red, bronze or white.  If you would like to get a better idea of what the bronze color looks like please see this listing 
www.etsy.com/listing/128957422/modern-mailbox-large-teak-and-stainless.
  The last two images show the bronze cover.
It is recommended that this mailbox be mounted to a wall that has shelter of some kind such as eves, porch or an overhang etc. Exposer to heavy rain is not recommended.  This is because of the small opening along the top of the mailbox that could have the possibly of leaking.  The bottom of the wood box is cement board.  This material is used because it will not warp when exposed to possible moister and it is a heavy material that creates weight that keeps the mailbox in the closed position.
The image shown is not the actual mailbox that you will receive for this listing.        ",325.00,4.9302,"Handmade item

7505,Organic Coffee Scrub - Organic Body Scrub - Coffee Body Scrub -  4 oz Sugar Scrub- All Natural Sugar Scrub - Fair Trade Coffee  Sugar Scrub,"
            Using Organic Coffee sugar scrub is like visiting the spa in your own shower! It gently rubs away dead skin cells, allowing your skin to feel rejuvenated. Sugar also naturally draws moisture to your skin to keep it hydrated--a good choice for your winter skin regimen! 
A 4 oz jar of Organic Coffee Sugar Scrub will keep your skin glowing and healthy! Coffee grounds can temporarily reduce the visibility of cellulite and make skin appear firmer. 
The scrub comes in an glass amber jar to preserve all the aromatherapy goodness of the essential oils! 
For easy scooping and to prevent water from entering the scrub (this is a preservative-free scrub!), add wooden bamboo spoon for 1. 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/271063984/bamboo-wooden-spoon-sugar-scrub-add-on?ref=shop_home_active_1
WHAT'S INSIDE:
Sweet Almond Oil- works as an emollient for softening and conditioning the skin. It's great for dry, problem skin. It's light and won't make your skin feel oily. 
Jojoba Oil- provides long-lasting moisture and resembles the skin's natural sebum, so it also won't leave your skin feeling oily or greasy. It's antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory so it may be ideal for those who suffer from acne. It is also balancing so it's ideal for all skin types. 
Organic Pure Cane Sugar- Sugar is a natural humectant, meaning it draws moisture from the air to the skin so it will help hydrate the skin. Sugar is also exfoliating so it will help rub off the dead skin cells to reveal the healthy newer skin below. 
Organic Fair-Trade Coffee Grounds- can temporarily reduce the visibility of cellulite and make skin appear firmer. 
We are proud to use locally-roasted Ricks Roasters Papua New Guinea Coffee. The coffee is naturally-grown on Papua New Guinea Highlands and is pesticide free! 
HOW TO USE: 
If the oils and sugar have separated a little, stir to remix. Take a dime-sized amount into your palm and rub in a circular motion on your body or your face. It will help to rub off the dead-skin cells while the oils will hydrate your skin. Rinse. It may seem like it's hard to wash off the oil, but don't worry! Your skin will soon soak it up and feel super soft and moisturized. This all-natural sugar scrub will make your skin so happy!
We also have a larger jar available. See

Keepin’ Cozy Willy Pads are Hot/Cold Pads that can be microwaved for heat or kept in the freezer for an easy ice pack.  
This listing is for 1 Willy Pad made of the fabric pictured and is available in 4 sizes;
Small:        5"" X 5""           6  
Medium:    5"" X 10""        10

XLarge:     5"" X 20""        20   (Shown in Listing)
Bundle 3 Small Willy Pads for a discounted price of 5 each (great for ice packs)
Gift Set includes 1 Large and 1 Small for the discounted price of 20
The Willy Pad is double-sided with the same fabric and the edges have been double-stitched for added strength and durability.
They can be used to relieve achy pains, headaches, soreness, tension, cramps, sinus pressure, muscle aches, stress, boo-boos, and a multitude of other needs....
Each pad is handmade and filled with golden flax seed. Flax seed is much more durable and pliable than other fillers like rice and corn (which can become harsh), allowing you to mold the bag easily to any body part. By using flax seed, its outer shell doesn't emit the “food” odor that rice and other dry products do over time. The seeds also stay warmer/colder longer. Flax Seed is 30-40% oil, which remains inside the seed to be warmed again and again. Most grain products lose their ability to retain heat as the water cooks out of the grains.
Lavender has healing properties that promote a feeling of calm and relaxation. 
Keep your pad in the freezer for an easy to grab ice pack, then when needed warm, microwave for 30 seconds - 3 minutes for a quick heating pad that will stay hot for approximately 1 hour.  
Instruction sheet included.

•	Once you receive your order remove it from packaging and store in airtight container. Store away from direct light. Store items at room temperature. Do not refrigerate or freeze. Fondant items will safely keep for several months if stored properly. Fondant will harden when it is dry, but will soften up when placed on frosting.

Firebird perfume oils are concentrated fragrance in a base of fractionated coconut oil- super light, quickly absorbed, and non-staining. Because they're rolled on instead of sprayed, the scent is worn closer to the body than typical alcohol-based sprays- so you're not going to knock over everyone you walk past (which is a good thing, right?) The scent also doesn't evaporate as quickly as with alcohol-based perfumes, and you don't have to wait for the alcohol smell to dissipate before you get the true scent of the perfume.

8902,"Natural Deodorant, Lavender Tea Tree, Sunny Citrus, Choose Your Scent, Aluminum Free, 2 ounce twist-up tube","
            *NEW* scents available - Serenity and Fresh Bamboo with baking soda!
For those sensitive to baking soda, all 3 scents are now available without baking soda.  Some people are sensitive to baking soda and may experience irritation from using such a deodorant.  If you experience any irritation when using this product, discontinue use immediately.  For the sake of my customers who have no issues with baking soda in this deodorant, I continue to offer the baking soda version as well.
I started using aluminum-free deodorants to avoid the irritating ingredients found in commercial antiperspirants and deodorants.  Finding the right deodorant wasn't easy, though.  I loved the idea of natural deodorants, but the ones in the stores just didn't work well for me.  And despite their ""all natural"" claims, the list of ingredients on the back didn't sound all that natural to me.
Natural deodorants won't stop perspiration, but rather use essential oils and other natural ingredients like baking soda, arrowroot and kaolin clay to absorb sweat and kill odor-causing bacteria.  
Note:  This product does not contain ingredients that prevent perspiration (your body's natural way of cooling you down and getting rid of toxins).  On very hot days, or depending on your activity level, you may need to re-apply.  Please allow your body time to adjust to natural products.

 - Parabens
 - Preservatives
 - Synthetic chemicals

9063,Calendula Salve // Handmade Salve // Eczema Psoriasis Salve // Salve for Cuts // First Aid Salve // Healing Salve // Eczema Salve,"
            Calendula has been used for skin conditions like Psoriasis, Eczema, Dermatitis, cuts, and scrapes.  
Our Calendula Salve is handmade from beautifully organic Calendula flowers that have never even heard of pesticides! We use flowers that are sustainably grown and hand harvested.  After harvest the Calendula is infused in pure olive oil to transfer all the benefits of the flower to the oil.  We then add the infusion to our high quality beeswax and add a touch of vitamin E.  
     This salve is a staple to have in any home and it makes a great gift.  You could purchase the  4 oz. size and place it in smaller containers to make it more portable. Put some in the bathroom, the first aid kit, and still have some left over for work and travel.  Our salves are not too thick, so they spread easily and are better absorbed by the skin.  A little goes a long way!
This salve is offered in 1, 2 and 4 ounce sizes.  Just select your perfect size from the drop down menu above ;)
If you have a question please ask, and we'll be as helpful as possible.  Want something specific?  You can contact us!  We believe in the power of prayer and God's ability to handle any situation. If you would like us to pray for you please let us know... no purchase necessary :)
“Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.” –Psalm 51:10

9987,Legend of Zelda Amiibo Chips,"
            Hi Res photos printed on 1.5 inch thick card stock chips with UV Gloss to create the perfect fully functional Amiibo chip.  They can be scanned just like the real thing and can be easily stored and stacked.  These are the most convenient way to carry your characters around compared to conventional figures and cards.  You can also use the chips to eliminate the need to open up your collectible figures still in packaging.  These figures are made in short supply and run out very quickly, it's always preferable to get the real figures where possible.  These chips are a great supplement to an Amiibo collector, allowing them to play with the characters without damaging the packaging on their Nintendo licensed product. 
The Wolf Link in this listing is for a fully leveled Wolf Link which will result in a 20 heart Wolf Link spawn in the video game, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.  
If you purchase ANY of the bundles, I will throw in Wolf Link for free, you can choose to purchase Wolf Link on it's own at its listed price if you would like!
Listing also includes two currently unreleased figures (Skyward Sword Link, Majora's Mask Link)
All chips have been tested to ensure they are properly working and will be tested prior to shipping.

Customers must understand these are handmade items, each one is printed, assembled, inspected, tested, and packaged. Job #1 is to ensure that the product is perfect when it leaves our hands, and all of this takes time. We feel that our spinners are well worth the wait. You will also see there are many instances where we ship well before the estimated shipping time. Furthermore, we are also at the mercy of other suppliers, for bearings and plastic. 
2) Spin Times - We do not guarantee spin time. We go through a long process of preparing the bearings, both stainless and ceramic, and have developed an awesome method of preparing and tuning the bearings for excellent spin times.  With that said, there are many factors involved that we cannot control, so there are no guarantees. We can honestly say that no two bearings are exactly the same, anyone who tells you that is not being honest. We have some ceramic bearings that we have prepared that spin for 3.5 minutes and some prepared the same exact way will get 1.5 minutes. Again, there is no guarantee on the spin time.
3) Caps - Currently the caps are being installed so that the customer can remove them. Permanent installation would mean that you could never clean the center bearing, change center caps, or re-use it in the event of the spinner being destroyed. We've decided to leave them removable. With that said, if your caps are not staying on, you can use a few methods to correct. a) Use super glue, but again, you will never get them off again, b) wrap a small piece of clear tape around the post. This is usually all that is needed to remedy the situation.
4) Returns: Returns will only be accepted if the item is damaged in the mail.  You must return the item to us, so that we can put the existing bearings into a new spinner body. Customer damaged returns will not be accepted. The customer must understand that these are plastic printed items, and therefore should understand that these are not indestructible. They must be handled with care.
5) Shipping Method - All items are shipped USPS First Class Mail with tracking in a bubble mailer. Our shipping cost is a flat 3 no matter how many items you order.        ",6.00,4.8131,"Handmade item

10507,"Custom Guitar Pick, Photo Guitar Pick, Personalized Guitar Pick, Guitar Picks,","
            For the guitar player, band merchandise or giveaway -- we now have custom printed double sided guitar picks printed with your full-color photo & text!! This is an amazing one-of-a-kind gift! Don't miss out ... We do have limited quantities before the holidays!! :)
This listing includes 1 custom printed personalized piece, with your photo on one side & your custom text on the other side. (Short phrase only up to 15 characters, picks are small!! Long phrase or words will not fit and will not be legible.) The pick is .020 thick lightweight plastic. One side is glossy and the other side is matte.
______________________________________________________________________________________
HOW TO SEND YOUR PHOTO: Once you make a purchase, send the photo(s) through Etsy messages at the bottom of your text area it says ""Attach Image."" Your artwork can be EPS, JPG, PNG, TIF or AI format. Photos sent blurry or low resolution will print blurry and low resolution. Please send high resolution images or files only for best quality. WE DO NOT PRINT COPYRIGHT PROTECTED or LICENSED MATERIAL — Send Your Photos ONLY!
*OPTIONAL* How To Send Us Custom Text for the Back of Your Pick: Please specify your custom text (up to 15 characters) in the ""notes to seller"" at checkout. This will ensure the text displays properly with your order when we receive it. If custom text is NOT specified and written in the ""notes to seller"" at checkout, it will not be printed on your pick and you will receive a pick with your photo printed on BOTH sides.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
PLEASE NOTE: The shape of the guitar pick will crop out portions of the photo. Please take note of the shape of your subject compared to the shape of the guitar pick. If you have certain people or objects that you want on the pick, you must provide us with a photo where they fit within the center of the shape. It is best to not submit cropped photos. Photos cropped tight on the subject do not work well. Photos that are light or bright with 1 or 2 large subjects work best. Dark photos will print dark. Photos may print to the pick darker than the original, this is not a defect — it is due to our printing process to the plastic material.
I do not edit the photos submitted, please provide a light or bright colored photo as suggested for best results - no refunds are provided due to dark or blurry photos. The guitar pick is small, and group photos will appear very tiny.
Your photo will be cropped to fit. If you are unsure if your photo will fit into the shape or objects will be cut off — you can purchase a proof for an additional cost at:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/203626125/digital-proof-of-custom-product.

10708,Harry Potter Magnets | Harry Potter House Magnets | Wizard Magnets | Harry Potter Decor | Harry Potter Accessories | Harry Potter Decoration,"
            These cool Harry Potter magnets are great in the home, at work and as gifts.  Put em on your fridge or give them as a gift, either way, your friends will know you're a wizard when it comes to finding cool items.
They are laser engraved on maple wood and are about 2"" tall and wide and a quarter of an inch thick.
If you want just 3, on the right hand side drop down, select quantity of 3 and amount of 1 and let me know which 3 you want.  You may want three of one style, that is fine.  If you need an order of say 8, put in an order with the amount of 5 and quantity of 1 and you'll have to put in a separate order with the amount of 1 and quantity of 3.  
I only use strong magnets.  Sometimes they'll be ceramic, other times they'll be small neodymium magnets, it just depends on what I have on hand when I make them.
Because Etsy only allows me to add one dimension for the calculated shipping costs, I did the weight of 2 magnets.  If I can ship items for less than what they calculate, I will refund the difference.  So for example if you order 4 magnets and it charges you 3 dollars for shipping, but only costs me 2 dollars, I will refund you a dollar. I will pay the extra for the shipping of larger orders.        ",6.00,4.9724,"Handmade item

How do I apply my decal?

Peel off the white paper backing and apply the sticky part to the glass or surface. Applying from one side to the other will reduce air bubbles. Rub or squeegee on with a plastic squeegee. ( I.D. Cards work too) 3. Now, Just peel off the remaining plastic or paper application tape very slowly at a sharp angle away from the decal. If the decal starts to come up as well rub it again or squeegee more then try again patiently.        ",6.00,4.6923,"Handmade item

Dimensions & Stitch Count based on the Capital A.
GRACE SIZING & ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Sizing for all Grace Sets is based on the height of the capital A in the Grace 1 Monogram Set. All Grace sets are from the same parent font. Each set can be used on its own or letters can be combined and interchanged with every Grace Set. All 2"" letters are sized to work together, etc...
Grace 2 has some of the larger letters in all of the Grace Sets. The Uppercase Letters are unique to this set. The Plain Lowercase Letters may be shared with another Grace set. The Alternate Lowercase Letters are unique to this set. If you have a 4×4 hoop limitation, Grace 3 & 5 may be better options for you due to letter size. Capital letter sizes vary according to the swashes/swirls offered by the font designer. Please see the additional images to view the letters included.
*Actual letter sizes will vary. 2"" refers to the height of the capital A in Grace 1.  See images for size comparisons.  Some of the letters may be significantly smaller or larger than 2"" based on the swashes/swirls. 
*For BX format, a TEXT file is included with information on which keys to use for the alternate letters.

            MODERN ARTISTIC OCEAN PRINT BY CHARLEY HARPER
## We offer this fabric by the 1/2 yard. To order 1 yard, select a quantity of 2 and so on. I will cut your fabric in one continuous piece.
## Please visit www.spindleandrose.com for free shipping on US orders of 50 or more AND to find additional cuts of fabric including 1/4 yard, 1/2 yard, 3/4 yard, 1 yard, and Fat Quarters!
## Find this product with all of the options described above at:
www.spindleandrose.com/products/whale-fabric-charley-harper-fabric-birch-organic-fabrics-ocean-fabric-humpback-whale-print-whales-breaching-beach-decor-sea
 
""Love on the Richter Scale""
100% Certified organic cotton from Birch Fabrics. Designed by Charley Harper from his Maritime Collection.
Wow... Humpbacks rise to meet one another like seismic waves – a love so strong as to cross oceans, cause the earth to shake.
Whales are about five and a quarter inches tall.
Long distance is the next best thing to being there. But a dove in love would rather reach out and touch someone. Spring is in the air and all lines are busy with local calls as the wooing and cooing commences. Charley Harper
 
*Care Instructions: Birch Fabrics recommends washing their fabric on the gentle cycle in cold water with like colors using a fragrance free, non-chlorinated detergent that is preferably, environmentally friendly. You can dry your fabric on low, but hang drying will further increase the fabric's longevity. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Multiple lengths of the same fabric will be cut as one continuous piece*
SHIPPING POLICIES:
I will refund any significant (1 and over) shipping overages ~ I can typically fit up to 2 and 1/2 yards of fabric in a First Class Package for under 4, however, certain types of fabric are heavier so there are exceptions. More than 2 1/2 yards of material makes the weight of the package too heavy for First Class and will ship Priority but I will choose the best Flat Rate Priority option to ship your fabric and refund any overages. For example, I can typically fit 2-3 yards in a flat rate legal envelope for 6.95 (Canvas, Knit, and Double Gauze may be too thick) and 5-8 yards depending on the fabric in a Flat Rate Padded Envelope for 7.20. Larger orders may need to go in a medium flat rate box. Again, it depends on the weight and thickness of the fabric but I will choose the least expensive option and refund overages.
***FREE SHIPPING on orders over 50 if you order on the website spindleandrose.com*****
INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING
I am happy and honored to have international orders!! Please note that 98% of my international packages have arrived successfully by First Class International Package to the destination within 2-3 weeks. I do understand it is expensive to ship and First Class International is the most affordable option, however please note that First Class International is NOT TRACKABLE. A tracking number is provided and in most cases we can follow that number along with the package on its route to you, but if there are ANY issues, the US post office WILL NOT HELP ME track down your package.
If you are concerned about your order, please contact me. I am more than happy to see what I can do to fix the situation and make this a pleasant experience :) Just please understand, once the fabric is delivered to the post office, if it is First Class International Package, it is out of my hands. Priority International is the only guaranteed tracking that includes any help from post office personnel, but I completely understand that it is an expensive shipping option. IF SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT
I check and double check your order because I know how exciting it is to get new material for awaiting projects! Of course, if I make any mistakes and your order is not correct, I will do all I can to make it right!
I want my customers to get the newest, quality fabric from my shop, so typically, unless it is my mistake, I can't accept returns on cut fabric. However, my main priority is making my customers happy, so, if there's a concern, let's talk about it and see what I can do!
Thank you so much for visiting!

            Ecru/Undyed/Natural Corriedale wool roving (combed top), spinning fiber - 4 ounces **
This is a beautiful, naturally colored wool that I use as the base for some of the lovely colorways you see here! Sheepish Creations is now offering this lovely wool with the discount that comes with buying in bulk!
For those of you who enjoy spinning, here's 100% lovely Corriedale fiber. This is soft, lofty, and has a long staple so it's fabulous for all skill levels. This is processed as combed top, although is often incorrectly referred to as roving. I spin this fiber myself, and I love the lofty and unique yarn that I can achieve so easily.
Have fun trying out a less-common type of wool. Sure to be a pleasure to spin!
This wool is also perfect for stuffing waldorf dolls!
This roving is professionally processed, free of neps, felting, and general ickiness. As you can tell from the picture, it is a lovely natural shade.
(Bobbins not included. :)

            Beautiful Soft and fluffy reindeer moss. (These are actually a lichen) Regular 6 per bag
*****Choose from 16 colors or natural*****
Bleached white is lighter than the natural...not all paper white but is more white than natural.
You will get a 6""x9"" qt bag filled with 2 Oz. laid out it is about a 10""x10"" square.
Deer foot lichen comes in smaller pieces unlike it's cousin the reindeer moss lichen. You can see the sections are like deer hooves small sections usually in a clump but also shown here in individual sections.
There may be some small bits of pine needle in the moss which is just natural from where it grows. It is hard for me to remove every piece and still offer this great price.
This is real moss but is preserved now so NO WATER IS NEEDED to keep them alive.
1 Oz bag is here:

NOTE: It is not recommended to mix LIVE & Preserved moss/Lichens together as this will cause mold and kill the live moss.
Preserved can be used in orbs with air plants or placed on the rocks of succulents etc.
