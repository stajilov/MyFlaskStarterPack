8179,Lavender - Preserved Lavender - Provence Lavender - 2016 crop - Lavender Bunch - Lavender Bouquet - Bouquet - French Lavender -Wedding Decor,"
            This listing is for 1 bunch of our Provence preserved lavender. Each bunch has roughly 250 individual sprigs of lavender. These bouquets are VERY fragrant and have a deep purple color. Over time they will slightly turn a light purple/ grey color but the fragrance will still be there.
 Each bundle color and fragrance (on average) lasts for over a year with special care. The longer you keep the lavender away from sunlight and moisture the longer the lavender will last. 
 (Each bouquet is roughly 14""-15"" tall and measures 2"" wide around the band at the bottom)

*****************************************************************************
~~A little about me:
I personally design and create every item I sell.   If the item you are are purchasing states that it is a  ""One of a kind"", you will receive the exact wreath pictured when purchasing. If you have selected an item that I have designed but make multiples, every effort is made is to duplicate the original design as pictured.  Please keep in mind they are completely handcrafted and no 2 will be identical.   However,  I will never replace or substitute materials different from what is pictured. 
Each item is handcrafted here in my home workshop in West Virginia!
I love working from home with the love and support of my husband and fur babies...2 Goofy clown Boxers, Cocoa & Kaiya and a princess Himalayan kitty,  Joon!
******************************************************************************
~~Custom work:
If you see and love a design concept,  but for example want to omit something or change a color; simply request a custom order under that listing and describe the desired vision you have in mind. 
Like my style but don't see what you're looking for. Request a custom order and I'll be more than happy to work with you to make your vision a reality. 
If the design contains materials I do not stock on hand, the turn around time for delivery may be a little longer than my average 1-3 days
* please note:   I will not duplicate someone else's design exactly or for less money. Nor would I want someone to duplicate my designs. Designers put a lot of time, effort and personal energy into creating something original, special and beautiful. 
******************************************************************************
~~What others have said upon receiving their wreath:
...Wreath came quickly and is even more beautiful in person. Going to have a hard time giving this as a gift!  Will be be getting another for myself after the Holidays!

******************************************************************************
~~Shipping
I use USPS only!  Because it has proven to be the most economical and includes insurance and tracking information. Once you have finalized your purchase, I receive an email notification. When I print and purchase the mailing label you automatically receive an email that the item is being shipped. Your tracking information is included, so you can follow from my house to yours. 
I use a new sturdy box for every shipment that may also be used to store your wreath. 
* I would also like to add that I DO NOT make money on shipping. I use the calculated shipping so you are charged precisely on the item to your exact destination. Taking out that guess work is easier on both of us        ",48.00,4.9881,"Handmade item

Boxwood and burlap are a winning combination for farmhouse décor!
This wreath is made on a grapevine wreath base with realistic artificial boxwood in variegated green tones, baby eucalyptus for a soft wispy feel and a wired burlap bow - so very pretty and works with every décor style. An especially durable wreath for outdoor use!
The simplicity of boxwood is the perfect compliment to farmhouse and cottage décor. And what a lovely wreath for a rustic wedding!
The bow is easy to remove when you are ready for a change. And a mirror image of this wreath is available for double doors!
Made from a 14"" natural grapevine wreath base, the finished size measures approximately 18"" in diameter and 5"" deep. 
*This wreath is also available in a 22"" size.

Wreaths make wonderful and unique gifts! If you are sending your gift directly to the recipient, I would be happy to enclose a gift card with your personal message.
All wreaths come with a loop on the back for hanging or you can use a wreath hanger (not included).
Your wreath will be carefully packed with bubble wrap and tissue paper and shipped in a sturdy corrugated box, perfect for wreath storage.
This wreath is suitable for indoor or outdoor use, but a covered or sheltered area is recommended for long-lasting beauty.
Don't hesitate to ask a question or request a custom order!

Why should you purchase from my shop?
-All my creations are originals (like my Tulip wreaths created in Feb. 2011). I always strive to create large, full wreaths at competitive prices.  My goal is to provide you with a unique wreath that will ""wow"" your neighbors and friends! If you need a custom or smaller wreath don't hesitate to contact me.
- My wreaths are professionally shipped through UPS and shipping costs include insurance. I personally pack every box to ensure that it arrives safely and in perfect condition.
- Returns are easy. If you do not like a wreath that you purchased just contact me. You will have to pay the return shipping, but you can use my shipping discount as opposed to paying two to three times at a retail store. It saves you time and money.
- Gift messages are always complimentary. Giving a gift to someone special is worry free. 
- I have six years of wreath making experience in all forms of wreath types: silk, dried floral and evergreen. I purchase supplies that are Made in the USA whenever I can. As a result my wreaths have been selected to be featured on ABC's Extreme Home Makeover Edition and many blogs such as http://blog.charterhomes.com. 
- Finally, I LOVE my customers and always feel honored that are displaying something that I've created in their home. Every wreath made is double and triple checked to ensure that the wreath looks like the original and that the recipient will love what they have purchased. Thank you for your support!
Thank you for visiting my collection!

8901,"itWorks(tm) ANTI-PERSPIRANT Deodorant, Normal and Sensitive Skin (baking soda free)--Organic","
            No, this is not a trick, nor an oxymoron.
We've tested it, incorporating latest research, and are pleased to present a natural solution for heavy perspiration.  There is no aluminum or other heavy metals present in this formula.  The specific blend of essential oils works to gradually and naturally reduce sweating in most individuals.  New users will experience a period of adjustment ranging from 2 days to 2 weeks, after which time you can fully judge how a particular blend performs on you.  If you experience body odor in the morning, use the deodorant at night to speed up the process of adjustment.
The additional aromas (described below) are not simply fragrances, but additional essential oil blends with slightly different affect on individual body chemistry.  Most of our essential oils are organic and we use a complex blend of 13 base essential oils to keep you clean, healthy, and smelling great!
Our deodorants and antiperspirants are made with organic coconut oil for its antibacterial and anti fungal properties, organic butters that nourish and moisturize underarms, and arrowroot powder that absorbs moisture and draws toxins out of your skin. We don't use corn starch, which, while absorbing sweat, also feeds the underarm bacteria!
There are two types of antiperspirant offered, REGULAR formula and SENSITIVE (without baking soda).  The sensitivity does not correspond to otherwise ""sensitive"" skin, but only to sensitivity to baking soda, which you may or may not have. If you have previously determined sensitivity to baking soda, order the sensitive formula. If you are using the normal formula and develop underarm irritation, itchiness, or redness, you are likely sensitive to baking soda and should switch from the normal to the sensitive formula.  You can TEST yourself for SENSITIVITY to baking soda by applying a wet paste made with water and baking soda to your underarms.  If you have no reaction to the baking soda past, you should be fine with the normal formula.
The degree of sensitivity varies from person to person.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMER FORMULA is a default March 15 until September 15.
WINTER FORMULA is default September 16 until March 14.
If you prefer a softer, creamier formula, live in a cold climate, or your house temperature is below 72F at night, please ask for a WINTER formula. Summer formula is for indoor (bathroom) temperatures that exceed 72-74F at night or for carrying around in heat (beach, gym bags, purses, etc...).If asking for a formula that is not the current default, please indicate your choice with at NOTE AT CHECKOUT.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Due to rate changes by United States Postal Service it is now much more cost effective to ship MULTIPLE tubes of deodorant.  With new rates, 1 tube costs us about 14 in shipping, whereas 2-7 tubes can be shipped for 22.
_________________________________________________________________________
The essential oil aroma choices are arranged in a descending order of body odor control strength, starting with the strongest blend.  For comparison, Tom's of Maine scented deodorants are about strength 2-3, and Lavanila strength 3-4.
AROMAS: 
FIR FOREST:  This scent has a top note of Douglas Fir (it smells like a Christmas Tree!!), embedded in a blend that includes warm and classy sandalwood, spicy cedar wood and lemon, and undertones of patchouli and coconut.  This scent combination lasts the longest and is the original itWorks! formulation. It is suitable for men and women. Strongest protection (strength 10)!  This formula is recommended for hormonal and stress induced sweating as well as hyperhydrosis.
WARM SPICE: This is a wonderful blend of cinnamon, clove, orange and other warm aromas that remind you of fall harvest or winter holidays (or a holiday pie fresh out of the oven!).  As a side benefit, all of these essential oils also have strong deodorizing properties.  This deodorant can be requested ""in brown"" (no white marks!!) with the addition of pure organic cinnamon powder, which keeps you even drier and smelling even better!  You must request it brown, or it will be made without the additional cinnamon powder. (strength 9)
ROSE GERANIUM: A beautiful blend that harnesses all the best of Geranium, without the excessive and heady floral overtones.  It is revitalizing (particularly to women), detoxifying, and regenerative.  It's astringent properties are also useful in the deodorant blend, as is its effect on Candida. (Strength 9)
BOUQUET:  This combination of essential oils features a slightly green top note of delicate white flowers, including rose, neroli, geranium, bee balm, and violet. The scent mellows out into a classy light floral aroma. (Strength 7)
MYSTIC MANDARIN: Is likewise a citrus blend, but with more punch and spice than Sweet Orange Vanilla itWorks! Natural Deodorant.  It smells very loemon-y, very close to Lemon Verbena. It does not smell like Tangarines (mandarines): it is a blend of Neroli, Bergamot and May Chang as the top note.  Really stimulating and suitable for men and women.  May Chang has additional benefits of strong anti-microbial and cooling properties. May Chang's molecular constituents have been shown effective in inducing death and halting proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer. Peer-reviewed PLoS One journal (10/12/2012) published a study titled: ""Vapor of volatile oils from Litsea cubeba seed induces apoptosis and causes cell cycle arrest in lung cancer cells."" Researchers seperated four individual compounds from the 'crude' essential oil, and tested each for their cytotoxic properties on cancerous cells. Three of the four compounds showed cyctotoxic properties, resulting in cancer cell death. Importantly, these compounds at the concentrations tested did not adversely affect healthy lung cells in any way. Further, it was noted that a combination of the components was more effective that any single constituent. This supports the aroma-therapeutic principal that a whole, natural essential oil will be the best choice for virtually any given health-supporting application.  The study also noted that the benefits of May Chang can be delivered purely through inhalation! (Strength 6)
MEN'S CLASSIC: This formula is based on the most popular men's cologne ingredients, including petitgrain, rosemary, atlas cedar, calendula and rock rose.  It does not smell like petitgrain, but like a complex blend that it is. (Strength 6)
SPRING BREEZE:  If you have endured a long and cold winter, then you will appreciate the fabulous aroma of an evening garden in the spring and its wafting fragrance. This scent starts of with a sweet floral note and ages to a slightly floral baby powder type aroma. As always, only pure therapeutic-grade essential oils are used to blend into a wonderful, refreshing scent of our newest addition. (Strength 5)
LEMON VERBENA: BACK IN STOCK!
The most refreshing and sophisticated single note aroma. period.  This is a bestseller with good reason. Since Lemon Verbena can be sun sensitizing and we don't use it in creams and lotions, this is a great way to enjoy its benefits and aroma. There is currently a shortage of pure Lemon Verbena essential oil on the world market, so we may run out before new supplies become available. (Strength 5)

RECENT FEEDBACK:
""Love, love, love it!! It REALLY DOES WORK! Kept me dry in HK (mid-high 80's, 70-80% humidity) & in HI (mid 70's - mid 80's, 60-70% humidity)!! Haven't been able to use commercial antiperspirants for 30 years!! With these antiperspirants I had no rash, no burning & no itching!! Kept me dry for more than 24 hrs!! Will be ordering full size now that I used up the trial sizes! Fast shipping! Aleksandra is a GENIUS! She is also patient to answer & explain all your questions! NO commercial ""natural"" antiperspirant comes close to this! I have tried them all & this is the ONLY one I can use!!! I have extremely sensitive skin. I like the deodorants but I absolutely LOVE being DRY INSTEAD!! I am so thankful I came across this antiperspirant!! Thank you very, very much Aleksandra!!!""
""I usually don't buy natural deodorant because I sweat a lot and need something stronger like an antiperspirant. I've been using a top brand antiperspirant filled with chemicals and aluminum for years, even though all my other personal care products are strictly natural & organic when possible. Truly natural antiperspirants are hard to come by and deodorants don't help with the wetness. So, you could imagine my surprise when I came across this antiperspirant! First of all, it smells AMAZING and leaves NO white marks!! It's great after shaving and is completely natural, but the best part is that it works like a chemical antiperspirant!! I wore this on a hot summer day (80 degrees) and I was still feeling dry and had no odor by the day's end! Honestly, I have officially switched to this antiperspirant and will be upgrading to the full-size after I finish the trial. I'm really glad I came across this product! Thanks SO much Aleksandra!!! :)""
""I think we have a winner! I have purchased other natural deodorants to find after a couple days time, my armpit has turned red. I purchased the sensitive formula and after 4 days now I am still fine. The Rose Geranium scent is lovely as well and I find do have any foul odor. Thanks and I'll be back!""
""I've been using bodyBrana itWorks deodorant with sage for the past month and its awesome! Just a little goes a long way. I smell absolutely NO odor, not even a hint. Its not like a standard liquid roll-on or stick variety, its a thick all-natural creamy deo stick. A blend of organic cocoa butter, natural vegetable powders and clays, baking soda and essential oils neutralize odor for hours and hours (in my case it lasts all day). Make sure it dries before you dress up. You can get custom made deo with your choice of fragrance! With many natural deodorants, they are okay and semi-effective and I've used many where I have to re-apply throughout the day and if you're sweating like crazy, deodorant doesn't usually help with the wetness factor. This is taking care of both issues, due to sage and arrow root powder in it. I can not wait to put this to the test in the middle of summer!""
Works really well in this Florida heat. Like the personal note too.""
""...Just how great your product is!!! And how much I love it!
I mean I've had seriously sensitive skin the whole of my life.
Many times if I try a new lotion, soap, laundry detergent, etc. I end up so itchy that I have to take a shower immediately. So when I find something that works well.... it's just like a miracle for me.
I have tried 2 other good for avoidance of breast cancer deodorants. Neither of them worked as deodorants. And one of them gave me a rash.
So finding yours is just amazing for me and I am very grateful!""

MORE INFORMATION:
Natural Antiperspirant (Net Wt 3 oz): This pure and natural anti-perspirant builds on the great formula of the natural deodorant (see the description here: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/113102964/itworks-natural-deodorant
 ), but modifies ingredient proportions and also includes a synergistic combination of essential oils including elemi and sage, both proven to reduce sweating.  
Unlike the heavy-metal drugstore formulas (based on aluminum), this deodorant does NOT block your pores and lock in the toxins that would otherwise be naturally excreted from your body, but it reduces most of the heavy sweating from the inside out.  You might not be 100% dry, but  the reduction will be noticeable (individual results vary, but our reports suggest @ 70% reduction), and will decrease with time.  Some people notice immediate results, while others might require a detox and adjustment period of up to 2 weeks.
Choose aromas from the drop down menu on the right.  The scents are solely derived from therapeutic grade essential oils, not the synthetic fragrances nor fragrance oils.
This formula is NOT ADVISED for PREGNANT or nursing women.  While there are no reports of ill effects, essential oil of sage is not advised during pregnancy (though I have personally used it while nursing). If pregnant, order the itWorks! Natural DEODORANT:

10238,"Yard-Zee, Giant Yard Dice Yahtzee Game, Farkle Dice Game, Six handmade wooden dice with galvanized steel pail, Outdoor Yard-Zee Family Game","
            Yard-Zee set complete with SIX handmade wooden dice, 12 quart galvanized steel pail, laminated Yahtzee scorecard, laminated Farkle scorecard with instructions, and black Expo dry erase marker!
The six dice are hand made by using high quality untreated pine wood that is hand cut into blocks and then hand sanded to remove all splinter edges.  The dice are stained to ensure they withstand the outdoor elements for a long time to come.  Each dot in the dice is hand routed into the wood and then painted with a white exterior paint.  Each dice is approximately 3.5"" x 3.5"" x 3.5"".
All six dice fit comfortably in the 12 quart galvanized steel pail with handle.  A burlap patch with a hand painted Yard-Zee logo gives this set a finished, very cute look that will make everyone of all ages excited to play!
Both the Yahtzee scorecard and Farkle scorecard with instructions are laminated.  A black fine point dry erase Expo marker is included with each set.  The dry erase is easily wiped off the laminated sheets with a paper towel.
Although we always try to pick from the best wood available, there are natural variations in the dice from the wood grains and knots in the wood.  These are not defects, but again are natural variations making each and every dice unique.
We offer multiple options of painted and stained dice.  Please contact us if there is a specific color combination you are looking for, custom orders are welcome!        ",69.00,4.9785,"Handmade item

10592,To Each His Own | Vintage Sheet Music | Olivia DeHavilland | John Lund | Words and Music Jay Livingston and Ray Evans | 1940's music,"
            Beautiful vintage sheet music titled ""To Each His Own"". Words and music by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans.  This song was inspired by the movie of the same name which starred Olivia De Havilland and John Lund.
The sheet music is complete, measures approximately  9"" x 12"" and is in good condition. There is no writing on any of the pages however inside does show some slight wrinkles and a couple of very small discolorations.  This would be lovely in a vintage frame.
Please see pictures for more details and the imperfections, and feel free to contact me with any questions before you purchase.

11195,RING Pillow - RUSTIC Ring Bearer Pillow Wood Slice - Personalized - Wood Slice - Country Wedding - Brown,"
            This listing is for a Ring Bearer Wood Slice.  My husband will make each slice out of branches, each will vary slightly.  All slices will be approx. 4 inches wide x 1 inch tall (some may be larger or slightly smaller).  There are two drilled holes in the slice of wood. For a Touch of Country Charm we added a piece of Jute Twine, to tie your rings on with.
I will personalize each slice, by hand burning on your Initials and Wedding Date. (Please include the initials and date, that you would like, in the messages when you place your order).
This Wood Slice would be perfect for your ring bearer to carry down the aisle, at your Rustic Woodland Wedding.   And after your wedding, use it as a safe spot to tie your rings to; if you have a job or a sport that you are unable to wear them at.
Note:  Each ring bearer slice will be made with untreated wood.  Since this is a natural product, the wood may be cracked a little and the bark may separate away from the wood slightly. 
If you need more than what I have listed, please convo me, for the number of slices you would need, and I will be happy to make a Special Listing, for you.
These ring holder slices are made from fallen trees in our woods, here at The Flower Patch, in Northcentral Wisconsin.
Thank you, for visiting my store.
Note:  We have been receiving some amazing photos from previous customer’s weddings.  We have started a Face Book page for The Flower Patch, to share these photos with future brides.

            Sheepskin Slippers
Genuine shearling, a natural, soft wool, bathes your feet in comfort when you slip on these luxurious sheepskin slippers.  The combination of shearling with it's breathability and the suppleness of rough-out sheepskin simply cannot be equaled by imitations.  The slippers feature wool-out seams and a tough cowhide sole for durability.
COLOR PICTURED:  GOLD MISTY    (To view all the colors available visit our website:  www.thesheepherder.com and select ""Colors and Options"" from the Design Studio)
IMPORTANT NOTES:
◾Please be aware that sheepskin is a natural product and as a result, each hide may be slightly different in texture from the next.  You might see marks on your product.  These are not defects or blemishes.  They are just part of the natural hide and makes each piece unique.
◾Also keep in mind that each computer monitor and printer will show these colors a little differently.

            This item that will make any woman perfectly on-trend is the high waist flared pants. Yes ladies, in case you didn't get the multiple memos, 70s fashion is back!
We were inspired by 70's vintage clothing to style these statement flare pants. Featuring a flattering high waist, these bell bottoms are fitted to the knee and flare out to the ankle. The high waisted design will make your legs look miles long (especially when worn with heels) and instantly adds sophistication to any outfit. 
The denim jean fabric is a comfortable medium weight slightly stretch with no pocket, metal zipper, button, double side seam ranging self-countersinking, towards the bottom  . The blue scheme makes these pants very versatile and easy to match. Pair with crop tops and platforms for a classic vintage look.
Please note that since all of our items are custom made, you can ask us to adjust any of the measurements for our standard sizes listed below.

19447,Natural loose linen pants / Washed women linen trousers / Slightly tapered linen pants,"
            Washed and soft natural linen pants for simple and casual look. Pants have elastic waistband. 

WHAT MAKES YOUR ITEM SPECIAL 
Our items are handmade in small studio in small quantities of washed linen fabric, specially woven for us by our local linen manufacturers. The procedure of making these items takes time and effort, cause the items are double washed once they are made. Only after such process we reach extra softness and natural wrinkles.

DESCRIPTION:
- made from 100 % European linen (flax) - medium weight linen.
- the model is 172 cm high (regular XS) and the model is wearing size XS.
- two deep pockets,
- elastic waistband and drawstring (for dark color pants we will choose the  drawstring to be dark, for light colors it will be natural and undyed, but if you want any other choices, please leave a note); You can always take the drawstring of the pants if you want more official look; 
- color in the picture - natural. Please choose any other color on the right.
- not ironed (and no need to iron to have a relaxed look);
- handmade by small creative family.

THE FIT
The pants are rather roomy and slightly tapered being more wider in the hip area.
1.  We recommend to order your regular size for the fit like in the photos. They will be roomy and loose enough.
2. We recommend to order one size smaller for more fitted look. The customers who wanted more fitted look and ordered one size smaller were happy with the fit.   

COLOR
Natural color linen fabric may vary in every roll - as it is not dyed it depends on the flax itself (how it was grown, dried  etc.) and sometimes have darker or lighter shade.   
We found out linen to be rather hard to photograph to have an exact color for exposure - linen wrinkles often catches unexpected light and show thousands of shades in different positions and certain lights. The actual colors also vary due to your computer resolution and monitor color restrictions.
If you doubt about the color, we always suggest to have FABRIC SAMPLES to be send to you first before purchasing the exact item. The listing of the fabric samples can be found here:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/483583193/fabric-samples?ref=shop_home_active_1
If you are already purchasing any other item at the time (making an order), you may not order samples as they will be included in your package anyway.

19786,Vintage Minnetonka Boots - Tall Moccasin Boots - Minnetonka Moccasins - Lace Up Boots - Suede Fringe Boots,"
            These tall Minnetonka boots have lace up sides and fringed tops.  The soft suede is a  tawny brown.  
Wonderful vintage condition.  All boot lacing hardware is intact.  Bottom soles are in good condition.  There is very some wear/discoloration at crease on back of heel (see photo).  The suede in that spot is sturdy when felt from inside.  No odors.
The bottom of the soles measure just over 10.5"".  These would likely fit a size 9 or 9.5 women's size, but check bottom of foot for best fit.  Length is 17"".
