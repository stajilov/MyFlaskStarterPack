            I'm pleased to offer this beautiful vintage Levenger briefcase/attache.  This briefcase is in like new condition - it honestly does not look like anyone ever used it.  The black leather attache has a handle on each side (with a gold ring attached on one side of each handle - probably to attach a shoulder strap), On the back side of the attache is a flat slip pocket for easy access of papers, etc.  The top of the attache flips over and has magnetic snaps for easy fastening.  Both sides have a zipper starting at the top of the attache and ending at the bottom to allow the attache to lay flat.  When the attache is fully unzipped and laying flat, the main ""compartment"" has an area for a cell phone, 4 pens/pencils and business cards.  There is also flat slip pocket behind the ""cell phone compartment"" for holding files, paper, etc.  On the business card side of the attache compartment, there are 3 additional slip pockets for holding files, papers, etc.  
Maker:  Levenger
Date: Vintage
Measurements: 15"" in length, 2"" in width (at bottom), 10 1/2'' in height
