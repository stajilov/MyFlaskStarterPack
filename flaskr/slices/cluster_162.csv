            Smooth stitch markers for knitting. This listing is for 10 'Rainbow' Right-O rings. Sleek, smooth and totally snag free.
There are no dangles to get caught in your knitting. Light enough for sock/lace weight knitting, the bead helps you to handle them with ease.
This set of 10 Right-O rings was suggested by one of my customers. I love rainbows too - so here it is...the Rainbow set. 
There are six shiny ring colours, each accented by a co-ordinating glass sead bead. (You will receive more than one of the ring colours in your set of ten). If you have any colour preferences (e.g. blue & purple rings only), please let me know in 'note to seller'. If they're in stock I'll send them. Who knows....we may design the next set of Right-O rings together?!
***Note for previous customers: The purple ring now comes with an even better looking deeper purple silver lined bead***
< Will comfortably fit up to 4.5mm (US 7) knitting needle.
  Rings made with hardened aluminium for strength and minimum weight.
< Glass beads firmly glued in place with professional jewellery glue.
  Handmade in the UK by a knitter for knitters.
< supplied in the tin (approximately 35mm 1 1/2"" across).
  stitch markers are approximately 8mm (1/3"") across.
< also available without the tin. See separate listing here:   
https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/276737424/stitch-markers-knitting-supplies-snag?ref=listing-shop-header-2
