1677,Vintage 3 Pair Gold Swing Arm Curtain Rods - Flower Ends,"
            This is a set of 6 swing arm curtain rods (or 3 pair) which would be enough for 3 windows.  I do not have the brackets to attach them to the wall but if you search online you can still get them.  The rods adjust to the coverage you want over  your window.  The smallest length is 11 in. and when pulled out to extend goes to 20 in. wide.  The  rods measures 3/8 in. sq.  The flower decoration at the end is 1 1/2 in. high by 3 in. long.
The curtain rods are gilded in gold and the finish is not perfect.  There are some nicks and spots of color loss but nothing major.  They look as if they may have been taped together at some point and there is some old glue residue on the center of some of the rods.  All of the rods extend from the curved end (not the decorative end) and some slide  more easily than others.  I noticed a couple that you need to wiggle a little to get sliding to extend.
I do combine shipping if more than one item is purchased. I don't have a set rate and figure the cost by actual weight of package to your location plus a small handling charge.
New York residents must add 8% tax.

2399,Vintage Gold-tone Enamelled Bee Brooch,"
            *** ONLY A FEW LEFT IN STOCK NOW - POSSIBLY MORE EARLY NEXT SPRING BUT THIS IS THE LAST FEW BEFORE CHRISTMAS!!! ***
This pretty little bumble bee brooch is really sweet and is in perfect vintage condition as it is from 'new old stock' (stored).
** IMPORTANT: PLEASE SEE NOTE BELOW REGARDING PHOTOS ETC.**
The shiny gold tone and bronze colours are offset by black enamel and it is beautifully detailed  and realistically patterned.
It measures approx.1 1/2"" (3.5 cm) in each direction and has a strong, straight, secure and working  clasp at the back (unused).
There is no obvious makers mark but it would still be a highly collectable piece and definitely a great addition to anyone's wardrobe to cheer up any sombre or dull winter colours!
**I now have a number of these brooches - all from stored stock and totally unused. However, the supply is not limitless - once they're gone, they're gone!** This listing is for **ONE BROOCH ONLY** BUT THIS IS NOT A ONE-OFF ITEM - IT WILL BE REPLACED WITH ANOTHER AND ANOTHER UNTIL ALL STOCKS ARE USED UP - WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE VERY SOON NOW!! (If you require more than one brooch, please contact me ahead of purchase and I can arrange this for you).
PLEASE ALSO BE AWARE THAT THE PHOTOS IN THE LISTING ARE FROM DIFFERENT SUPPLIES OF THESE BROOCHES THAT I BOUGHT UP FROM 'BANKRUPT' (STORED/VINTAGE) STOCK AT DIFFERENT TIMES.  THEREFORE THE COLOURS DIFFER SLIGHTLY IN EACH PHOTO SHOWN! **THE CURRENT BEE BROOCHES** HAVE BLACK STRIPES THROUGHOUT (PICTURE 2 IS MOST ACCURATE FOR ACTUAL COLOUR), RATHER THAN THE BROWN SEEN IN THE FIRST PHOTO (FROM MY ORIGINAL SUPPLY) THE WINGS ARE A BEAUTIFUL BRONZE/ORANGE COLOUR AND VERY SHIMMERY - EXACTLY LIKE THE FIRST PHOTO IN THE LISTING! OTHERWISE, THESE BEE BROOCHES ARE IDENTICAL IN EVERY OTHER WAY! THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING.
**PLEASE ALSO NOTE: THE BACK OF EACH BROOCH MAY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM THE ONE SHOWN IN PHOTO NO. 5
Sorry, if this all sounds complicated!! The simple explanation is that your bee brooch will be identical to all those shown but the stripes will be black (no more brown left) and other colours may vary slightly, along with the backs! But I can guarantee that the brooch you will receive will be GORGEOUS!!

            This is a very nice blue train case by Royal Traveler! It features a plastic tray with separated areas, matching blue wipe-able interior with 3 pockets and chrome hardware. It would be wonderful for a secondary piece of luggage for an outing, vacation or honeymoon, a bridal case for her special day (something blue!), part of your home decor or a photography or stage prop. And it's perfect for craft storage! I have one that I keep under my bathroom sink to store all sorts of extras-keeps everything clean and dust free! Please see note below about SHIPPING. 
 
Condition: Even though this case shows some wear that comes with typical use like scratches and some loss in patina on the chrome and a few stains (nothing offensive), it is a very nice solid case. The elastic on the pockets is in great shape. I have wiped it down inside and out. No foul odors, no smoke, no mold.  
I have more photos available upon request.

4938,1920's Half Doll,"
            This half doll, with her red apple cheeks, has to I believe come from the 1920's, what I really love about her is the wonderful S shape which is created with her arms one upon her head and the other reaching the purple flower on the front of her dress.  On the back of the base she has some numbers and the word Germany imprinted on it.  Like all my half dolls she is a little dirty and as always I leave the future owner to decide whether or not to clean her.  She is in good condition with no chips or cracks that I can see.  She measures approx 2&1/2"" in height by 2&1/2"" in width (elbow to elbow).  She is wonderfully decorative and would make a wonderful addition for any collector but she is both beautiful and charming in her own right.        ",33.17,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1920s

7564,Jade Facial Roller / Lymphatic Massage Roller / Jade Roller,"
            Due to natural formations in the stones, each tool will be unique and vary from the picture that is listed. Some will be darker and some will be lighter. 
What are the benefits of the Jade Roller?
- Improve blood circulation and skin tone
- Improve elasticity of the skin
- Promote lymphatic drainage
- Reduce puffiness and wrinkles
- Reduce dark under eye circles
- Eliminate toxins
- Tighten and reduce pore size 
For extra healing, relaxation and inflammation reduction, place the stone in the refrigerator or on ice. The stone is naturally cold, but this extra temperature drop will aid in your efforts to increase circulation, drain congested lymph nodes, rid the body of toxins/waste, stimulate collagen production, help with sinus issues and balance chi.
Not sure how to use the Jade Roller? Don't worry, I have you covered!!

9569,Sympathy Gift Basket (small); Bereavement Gift;Grief Care; In Memory of Gift; Comfort Gift; Thinking of you Gift; Funeral gifft; Condolences,"
            Often times during tragedy and after loss, words feel so insignificant. When we see a friend or loved one hurting we want to do something but we're just not sure what that something is. When words fall short, let a Sympathy Gift Basket do the talking for you. As a result of experiencing grief first hand, we have made it our mission to put together care baskets full of handmade mementos and hand-picked items to send comfort to a loved one who has  just embarked on the journey of grief after losing a loved one. The personalized items are a beautiful way to honor and memorialize their lost loved one. Although there is often nothing we can do to fix a tragic situation, we can offer support to make the journey of a grieving friend just a little bit easier. Sending a Sympathy Gift Basket is a tangible way to show someone how much you truly care.
The small grief basket contains the following 7 items: 
1. A 5x7 hand-lettered print* - (when framed can serve as an encouragement or if Scripture is chosen as a reminder that God is near and knows right where your loved one is.) 
2. All natural homemade lip balm - (an essential to restore chapped lips as a result of the countless tears that will fall. Made with organic coconut oil, shea butter, beeswax, and spearmint oil)
3. Handmade Lavender soap
4. A remembrance candle - (a candle to light in remembrance of the lost loved one's DOB, anniversary, or DOD)
5. A small handpicked journal** - (Just as David poured out his heart in the Psalms, writing can be very therapeutic as your loved one walks through grief.)
6. A hand-lettered wooden ornament with the lost loved one's name* - (something your grieving friend can hang in their home or office to represent their lost loved one)
7. Package of forget-me-not seeds in a hand-lettered envelope - (These flowers germinate very easily and take over more ground each year to serve as an even greater reminder as time goes on)
*PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN 'NOTE TO SELLER' AT CHECKOUT:
1. The Psalm 56:8 print shown in the listing photos will be included in your basket unless you indicate that you'd like us to send you pictures of other options in an Etsy Conversation.
2. The name and/or dates you'd like to have personalized on the wooden ornament. If you'd prefer not to have the name and date, we can do a short phrase such as ""It is well"" or a word such as ""hope"" or ""love.""
3. What you would like the to/from gift tag to say that is attached to the twine wrapped around the basket?
**We will send you a photo in an Etsy conversation of the journals we have available to choose from.
We would love to hear about the person you are purchasing a basket for. We'd be honored to hear their story and be a small part of their journey. Send us an Etsy conversation with any information you'd like to share and we will keep it in mind as we select the handpicked items.

9763,"Wooden Double-Sided Hand-Painted Aggravation Board Game, Solid Oak-Wood","
            Hand-Painted Oak Aggravation Game Board. Sit down with the family and enjoy a classic game of Aggravation (also called Wahoo). The Aggravation board is hand-crafted out of solid wood by Mennonite folks in Holmes County, Ohio. The hexagon board is then meticulously hand painted by Kyle. The result is a beautiful Aggravation Game Board meant to last generations of play. It is double sided so you can play with up to 6 players on the one side and with up to 4 players on the other side. To play, move your marble players around the board according to the roll of your dice and try to position your marbles in the home positions before your opponents do. You can send your opponent's players back by landing on a location that they occupy, thus making them ""aggravated"". Choose between the economical 16"" wide board, the popular 20""wide board, or the large 24"" wide Board. These dimensions are the width across the points of the hexagon board which is the widest point. The Aggravation Game Board, 24 Playing Marbles and 6 Dice in a Drawstring Carry Bag, and Instructions for Play are all included. Note: Because this item is handmade, the wood grain pattern and coloration may be slightly different than pictured.        ",84.50,5.0,"Handmade item

17238,Hammered Hoop Earrings for Gauged Ears. Nahusha Tribal Hoops. Threaders. Made To Order.,"
            The Nahusha Hoops are inspired by my ouroboros Anglo Saxon brooches. Designed in lightweight, work-hardened aluminium to be worn through tunnels. The tumbled and hammered aluminium takes on a moon-glow. Perfect to wear if you don't want to stretch your gauge further but still want a minimalist rustic statement earring; they look heavy but are actually light to wear. This abstracted hoop is inspired by the World Serpents known throughout world myth as a creator-destroyer and keeper of secrets.
I make these hoops in 2 gauge sizes: large 4g (4.50 mm) weighing about 5 grams each; and medium 6g (3.25mm) weighing 2 grams each. All hoops measure approximately 2"" in diameter.
Open hoop by gently pulling one end toward you and then sliding it back into place, like a jump ring. 
Known to the Gnostics as the Wise Serpent, the Ouroboros revealed the mysteries of the heavens, protecting the world-egg, this symbol can be traced back to an earlier Goddess, Nehushta, a parallel of the Hindu world-serpent Nahusha. The Norse called this the Nidhogg, the World Serpent eating away at the roots of the World Tree.  A wingless dragon, she took on a darker significance in the Middle Ages when female snakes were thought to swallow the male in order to reproduce.
Here's what one satisfied customer had to say about these hoops:
""Perfect weight to them. Love the hammered texture. Easy to wear and goes with a lot of shit. Thank you again. Will be ordering new earrings soon"" - Kali        ",26.53,4.9509,"Handmade item
