3734,Ossie Clark dress Celia Birtwell Floating Daisy design 1960s for Radley vintage,"
            We are delighted to bring you this wonderful and rare original Ossie Clark and Celia Birtwell 'Mystic Daisy', or 'Floating Daisy' design dress, which was produced in moss crepe for Radley in 1967-68.
Ossie's dresses with fabric prints by Celia were among the most revealing evening dresses at this time, slashed or flowing tight against the body to show every line. Celia's gorgeous floral prints really brought Ossie's dress designs to life and have become prized collectors items.
Celia herself famously chose to wear Mystic Daisy to her own informal wedding to Ossie in 1969 at Kensington Registery Office. Their only guests were his sister Kay (who wore an Ossie and Ceila moss crepe dress) and the artist David Hockney.
This dress is an outstanding example of the creative collaboration between Ossie and Celia and gives us a real feel of the late 60s and early 70s, evoking Flower Power and Pyschedelia, and this great piece of design is as strong as ever today.
There are no size labels on the dress. It measures (when laid flat) bust 32"" inches,  waist 28"" inches and overall length from back of the neck to the bottom hem is 51"" inches. From shoulder to shoulder seam at the back of the dress is 13"" inches across.
This dress is in very good vintage condition for its age. On close inspection when looked at in a strong light I can see some beige coloured marks on the front ties (you can see one of these if you zoom in to photo two) and there is some feint marking around the underarms. Please ask if you would like to see photos of these areas. There are also some slight thread pulls on the crepe at the bottom left hand side of the front bodice. 
This beautiful piece of iconic fashion history will be shipped tracked and insured.        ",895.46,4.9219,"Vintage item from the 1960s

4715,Magnificent 1920s lame piano shawl in gold and red Art Deco metallic design with long orange fringing vintage antique,"
            Here is a magnificent original 1920s Art Deco gold and red lame shawl with long gold fringing and a very strong design throughout. It features typical Art Deco geometric patterns but you can also see the influence of the Aztec period in this shawl, which was one of the styles that fed into Art Deco in the mid-1920s. So this shawl combines both the modern Art Deco geometric motifs that became fashionable in the 1920s with influences from one of the more ancient periods in design that inspired the Art Deco designers. 
This shawl is very large, measuring 134cm by 134cm excluding the fringing, the fringing is 50cm long on each side so the overall size is 234cm by 234cm. 
Because it is so large, this could also be used as a spectacular wall hanging or table cover. I suspect that it has been used as a table cover in its history, because on one of the two sides, which would be the reverse of the piece, the gold lame metallic thread has been less exposed to the air over the years so it is much brighter overall than the lame thread on the other side. I have photographed the shawl on both sides so that you can see the different shades, you can see the side which is less bright in image five in the photos. It would certainly be possible to wear or to display the shawl this way round to show the brighter side. Both sides of the shawl have some areas where the lame thread has darkened over the years, this is more visible in certain light. 
I have more photographs of the shawl, please contact me if you would like to see more images of this fabulous piece or if you have any questions.        ",497.48,4.9219,"Vintage item from the 1920s

If you are a home crafter and stitch the designs yourself for sale (ie on ebay, through a website, at markets, or in craft shops), I do not consider this mass producing and I fully encourage the use for these purposes. Plus, if you get a chance, I would love to see what you do with the designs and post a link to your site or ebay shop!

9071,Vanilla Chai Lip Balm / Chapstick - Herbal Infused,"
            The recipe for our 'Vanilla Chai Lip Balm' was inspired by our 'Age Defying Facial Salve.'
We found that when applying our salve to the face (including lips) there were often days where no additional lip balm was necessary. The oils and beeswax in our salve recipe proved to be extremely nourishing and moisturizing for the lips. Adding a protective layer of goodness to heal and prevent dry, chapped, and cracked lips. Especially during the cold, dry, winter months!
In addition to the high quality specialty oils in our recipe, we have also added two butters that have been known to be extremely beneficial for the lips. Kokum Butter and Lillape Butter.
We have infused our oils with pure vanilla bean and a chai tea blend to give a subtle and comforting scent!
Directions: Hold the lip balm to your lips for a moment, allowing the warmth of your lips to slightly soften the balm. Then apply.

15593,NEW! Swedish Wrap Kit for Dollar and Half Dollar Sized Coins and a FREE Holder!,"
            The coin ring technique called the Swedish Wrap, (created by Mikael Möller from Sweden) is now available! 
*Now you can make the smallest rings form the biggest coins! 
This is the full kit and comes with two 2"" hardened stainless steel Swedish wrap dies, 5 hardened bronze plungers, and a FREE tool holder, 2 rolls of pipe tape, and a Jason's Works Sticker. These dies are designed to be the most efficient Swedish wrap dies available. 
The idea is to use the bronze plungers to press the ring down (reeded side up and wrapped in pipe thread tape) and use them as spacers on top of themselves to increase the stroke length as you reduce the coin further.
Using the largest die (1.0 x 1.4) take a Silver Eagle, Morgan dollar, a brass medallion (or other similar sized coins) as small as a size 9 using a 1 ton arbor press (or hydraulic press). With the other 17 degree and 25 degree dies offered on this site, you can reduce even further to a size 6 or more for a nice rounded shape.
Use the second die (.8 x 1.1) to reduce half dollar sized coins to size 4.75 and Silver Eagles, Morgans, and brass medallions to a size 2. With the other 17 degree and 25 degree dies offered on this site, you can reduce even further to a size 000 or more!
I like to reduce the ring to about 2 or 3 sizes larger than my target size. Once I reach that point, I then use my 17 degree die (whichever one the ring fits in) and then finish with the 25 degree die for a soft ""fat tire"" look. 
The witness lines on the bronze plungers allow you to see accurately how far you are pressing the coin. After some practice, and note taking, you can easily know when you have reached your desired reduced size. 
Using the arbor press or hydraulic press allows for 100% of the die to be used. The trick is to extrude the ring out of the  bottom for the smallest possible size (Thank you Mike Henry for that technique!)  A special feature has been added at the base of the die for proper extrusion.
*NOTE: When reducing the large brass coins or medallions in the second die for the smallest sizes possible, a hydraulic press is recommended to get the smallest possible size.
*NOTE: Be sure to not over press the plungers when using a hydraulic press. Know where each plunger bottoms out prior to pressing. Use the witness lines on the plunger to assist with this.
*NOTE: Remember the 5 most important steps in the Swedish Wrap method.
1. Anneal a lot. Preferably once for every plunger distance when working with silver. Up to two with brass. Better to annneal too often than not enough.
2. Use lots of pipe tape, rewrap after each press/anneal. Better to use too much than too little. I wrap up to 30 times for a half dollar and 40 times for a dollar if I'm using the thin tape. It depends on the thickness of the tape and how tough the coin is. Luckily it's cheap. Rolls can be found for  well under a dollar at stores or online.
3. It is better to press the reeded side. Prior to pressing,  make sure the plunger completely covers the reeded side of the coin. If it does not, use a 17 or 25 degree die to fold in the reeded side until the plunger covers the reeded side.
4. Do not overpress the plungers when using a hydraulic press or large arbor press. Know where each plunger bottoms out on the dies. 
5. Feel free to experiment with different ideas and have fun!
