5571,Pair of Turquoise Barrettes.Set of Silver Hairclips.Sterling and Turquoise Barrettes.Native American Hairclip.Southwestern Barrette.Tribal..,"
            This is a pair of silver barrettes. Each clip is set with a turquoise nugget. They are handcrafted and have a hammered design border. These barrettes will sparkle with a little wipe down. Each piece I purchased has a general wipe down, however, I have not posished the silver to their natural sparkle. 
Barrettes are in excellent condition.
