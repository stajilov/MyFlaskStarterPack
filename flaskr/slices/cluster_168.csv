            This beautiful Vintage Abalone hair barrette was handcrafted in Mexico in the 80's, each piece of shell was cut and polished by hand and then set into the alpaca fan design, this really makes the greens, blues and pinks of the shell stand out.
This is part of a collection of Vintage jewellery that my mum collected in the 80's when she bought and sold Mexican jewellery on her London market stall. This piece is in excellent condition and just goes to show that quality craftsmanship stands the test of time!
The dimensions of the barrette are 9cm Wide x 5.5 cm High.
If you've got any questions don't hesitate to ask me.
They may vary very slightly from the photo but only in the shade of shell, they are all pretty much the same but they are all individually handmade.        ",10.60,4.9675,"Vintage item from the 1980s

6284,"6"" Small BIRD SWING w/ EXTRA pieces","
            * Measures approximately 8"" tall, including the quick links for hanging; the perch part measures approx. 6""
* Suitable for budgies, parakeets, parrotlets, lovebirds, cockatiels, and other small to medium parrots
* Contains a variety of shapes and materials on each ""leg"" of the swing, so it's like having toys on either side of the bird as he swings
* The two swings shown are representative of the item, but each swing may be unique in its parts.  Each ""leg"" will contain at least one apple branch piece and at least one pine block (dyed with food grade food coloring), along with other shapes such as round beads, oblong beads, spools, cubes, etc., along with bits of jute twine
* Quick Link is STAINLESS STEEL.   Beware of nickel plated hardware which often does contain small amounts of zinc and can be harmful to your bird!
* Wire is also stainless steel
* Each toy comes with several extra pieces so that you may refurbish the toy when your bird chews off a piece
These are the same toys I make for MY birds, using safe materials.  A variety of textures and shapes makes the toys more interesting to the birds, and having the soft pine which they can actually destroy over time makes for a very satisfied bird!
The extra pieces included enable you to refurbish the toy as needed and extend it's life.
Please remember that anything you give your bird may turn into a hazard!  Inspect all toys and other items frequently to be sure they are safe!
I can ship two of these (or a 6"" swing and a small toy) for the same shipping cost, so it will pay to stock up!  Message me if you have special requests such as color and I'll be happy to see what I can do.  Excess shipping will be refunded - message me before you order if you would like a more accurate cost of shipping.
