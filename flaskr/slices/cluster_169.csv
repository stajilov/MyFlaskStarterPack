2854,100 Vintage 35mm Slides in Cardboard Frames - Vintage Photo Slides - Picture Slides for Altered Art,"
            100 vintage 35mm photo slides of various subject matter -- mainly family, travel, flora, and fauna. These are mostly from the 1960s and 70s, but a few are earlier and some are from the early 1980s.
All of the slides are in great condition -- I look at each and every slide before selling them to check for condition and appropriate subject matter.  A few have the name of the subject written on one side of the frame.  
These slides ALL have cardboard frames, so they're ready for turning into great projects like lampshades or curtains!
[Note that the last two photos show 50 slides each.]
Pair these with my metal slide frames for projects!

4833,"Photographer Gift, Hipster Gift,  Vintage, Retro Cameras Ranging From 1930's to 1990's!","
            **Please read the entire description.
The 1st photo is just for show, you will not receive bits and pieces, you will receive an actual camera.
**Check out the shout out to this listing given by thephotoargus.com !
* I currently do not ship outside the U.S.
Here's how this works:
You will receive 1 vintage camera dating anywhere from the 1930's to the 1990's that I will chose for you from my huge collection. It will be in good condition for it's age with some minor wear possibly, but I like that because I know that tells a story of it being used...and I love the mystery of what photos it must have taken. This listing is meant to be fun and exciting!
Each camera will come with a printed explanation of who it belonged to which is a fun part of it's history to have. I will also try to give you a bit of info about the camera such as the years it was produced, where it was made and what kind of film it takes (provided that I have that info...which I usually do).
I do not know if the cameras work as I have no film to test them, but I will send one that seems to be in good condition. These cameras are NOT perfect and may have some scratches or a small nick due to their age, but I will not send anything that I would not put on display in my home, and please feel free to ask as many question as you like. Some of the cameras may come with the original box or extra pieces such as a wrist strap, flash or lens, etc.
All of the photos shown in this listing are of my cameras. The more expensive ones have been auctioned, but I have a great selection left! Some of the cameras that I have left are duplicates where the originals sold for equal or greater value of the price in this listing. Value is based on what I have sold a camera for; a price guide can give you an idea of what one is worth, but seeing what it sells for is far more accurate because I have found that an item is only worth what someone will pay for it.
If you request a camera from the year that someone was born, please know that most cameras were not made during 1 single year, but rather were in production for several years.
**Please do not buy this item if you are hoping that I will mistakenly send a super high end and expensive camera by mistake. This is meant to be cool and fun and I have some nice old cameras to choose from.. 
Please feel free to describe the person that this may be a gift for; this info really helps me choose! I will do my best to select something to make you smile and if you have any preferences I will take them into consideration when I chose one, but I cannot guarantee that I can fulfill your wish so please make sure you are comfortable with me choosing an item for you as there are NO returns OR exchanges on this item.
These cameras all come from a large collection of a private collector who had them all on display and they have been stored in a dry, clean, moisture free area for years.
This would make a really fun gift for a photography buff or a camera collector! It's a great way to inspire a young person who may be starting to show an interest in photography!        ",39.50,5.0,"Vintage item

WARNING: 
Choking Hazard
Children under 8 years can choke or suffocate on uninflated or broken balloons. Adult supervision required. Keep uninflated balloons from children.  Discard broken balloons at once. 
Foil balloons may conduct electricity.  Do not release helium filled balloons or release near power lines.  Use only non-metallic ribbon and attach the balloon to a weight to keep it from floating away.  
HELIUM INSTRUCTIONS:
If filling with helium, we recommend carefully filling balloons with helium as close to the event as possible for best results.  Do not over-inflate, these balloons may pop. High altitude can affect the balloon's ability to float.   Foil balloons are sensitive to extreme temperature changes.  In cold air, they may appear deflated; warm air should expand them again.  Extreme heat can cause the helium to expand and burst the balloon.
AIR INSTRUCTIONS:
We recommend carefully inflating balloons with a balloon pump.  They self seal when inflated and have instructions for deflating for  re-use.  We do not refund popped balloons.        ",6.95,4.866,"Craft type: Party & gifting, Party & gifting

            It won't take a disco ball to get this skirt sparkling!  Made with countless sequins, it is surely to light up your mini's face when she wears it.  The outer layer is made of sequined tulle, while a champagne lining is underneath.  Elastic gathers the waistline.  Skirt falls above knee.
Hand wash.  Line dry.
Available in 2T, 3T, 4T, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14 sizes.
Made from an original JillyAtlanta pattern.
Model is wearing the Jeweled Top.  You can find it here...

The Golden Sequined Skirt and lining are french seamed and every effort is taken to detail. I am the designer and craftsman, ensuring that you get what you are looking for--the finest piece of clothing in your daughter's closet. She may not know what gathers and french seams are, but wearing them she will grow up knowing that she is unique. Jilly clothing frames her world with a sense of charm, innocence, dignity.
Each garment has my exclusive JillyAtlanta tag sewn into it. Each purchase comes wrapped with twine. A complimentary wooden hanger is available on request.

Note: These are typical size measurements. Of course, not everyone is typical (who is??), therefore, the benefit of custom-made clothing is to get pieces that are fitted to your child. So, please don't hesitate to contact me in giving me your child's individual size.
