134,Horse Nursery Decor - Wooden Rocking Horse - Vintage Rocking Horse - Horse Decor - Vintage First Birthday - Riding Horse - Wooden Horse Toy,"
            Due to the lack of space, we are parting with our family pet Charlie. This lovely vintage wooden horse has been in our family since I was my kids age (lets just say about 24 years ago). My kids have loved it throughout the years and now its time for others to love him as well. We believe Charlie is about 45 years young and still kicking; he has his original wool hair (good vintage condition) and beautiful little tan leather ears. The wood is in great condition for being loved as much as it was. He has so much personality and has brought our family so much joy. He is regularly exercised and loves to be feed at least four carrots a day. We are willing to part with Charlie to the right family. Please be aware he is a handful and loves attention. If you notice by his photographs, Charlie lost his reign many many moons ago but that hasn't stopped him from being a showstopper. Here are his most recent measurements (since he is a mature horse, he should not grow any more then what is listed): 
Runners are 32” long, Charlie is about 11"" wide at the base and measures about 30"" tall (measuring the tallest point). He weighs about 15 lbs (he's been watching his figure)
Please send me convo if you have any questions about Charlie.

140,Vintage 1950s Steiff boxer or French bull dog puppet mohair soft toy collectable,"
            Here is a super vintage Steiff dog puppet, probably from the 1950s.
This lovely puppet is i think either a boxer dog or a French bull dog, he has a wonderful face and is made from mohair. In natural beige and browns with straw filled head, stitched nose and brown glass eyes. In very good condition with no major wear from what I can see but sadly he has lost his button as shown in the third photo, still a great gift or present for yourself.
Condition: Very good (no button)
Measures 10inches from top of ear to bottom of glove
This is for an adult collector and not for a child.

645,Custom camping birthday shirt. Sizes 12m to youth medium. Other sizes and fabrics available.,"
            This cool shirt is perfect for any camping themed party and is sure to be a hit!
The shirt shown is black with a rust and aqua plaid tent. Font shown in main photo is ""squishy.""
I have all colors of fabrics in a large variety of prints, so I can easily match this to your theme if your colors differ from those shown. You an change the shirt color, fabric color(s)/print(s) and thread color(s). If no changes are noted in the note to seller during checkout, the colors and fabrics used will be the same as those in the main photo. 
Fonts choices are shown in the photos. If no font choice is indicated in the note to seller during checkout, the font shown in the main photo will be used. 
Applique is done on my home embroidery machine and care instructions will be included. Back of embroidery is covered with a special material that protects little one's skin. 
***************************************************************
Shirts are 100% cotton knit jersey, youth are 50/50 blend when available.
***PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE MEASUREMENTS IN THE SIZE CHARTS PROVIDED. In my opinion, the toddler 4 and 5/6 run wide. For this reason, I highly recommend going to a youth XS (4-5). Also, the youth shirt sizes are marked a little differently than some other brands as, for some reason, they switched the way they marked the shirt sizes this year. For example, a medium used to be an 8 and a large was a 10/12 but this supplier recently changed their size tags to a medium being a 10/12. However, other brands that run similar in length and width for each size are still tagged M(8) and L (10/12). If your child typically wears a M from a department store, the M in this brand will still fit, it will just be marked M 10/12 instead of the typical M (8) seen on brands in most stores. My son, for example wears a 10/12 pretty much everywhere and a large in plain T's. I still order him the large in this shirt as it fits the same as the other larges, it is just marked L (14/16) instead of L (10/12) as seen on Fruit of the Loom or Hanes T's. It is your responsibility to check the size charts provided and ensure you are ordering the correct size for your child. If you have any questions, I am happy to answer them. 
As you will note on the spec sheets, 24m and 2T have the same measurements. I may substitute one for the other depending on which I have in stock at the time. All measurements are shown, just zoom in on the photo. Measurements shown are garment measurements. Measure the length and width of a shirt that fits your child and compare those to the measurements in the chart to determine what size to order. 
*****************************************************
**NOTE** At checkout, please let me know the following about your order *(you can copy and paste this list). You will leave any shirt color, fabric or thread changes, and any other information you feel may be important in the special instructions section.

*These hand distressed shorts are a medium wash. They have an elastic adjustable waistband to help with sizing as well!  These jean shorts can be worn straight down or rolled up.  They are really cute either way!  
**The jeans pictured are just an EXAMPLE of what your jeans will look like. Due to the nature of creating these jeans there may be some variation in the jeans you receive since all jeans are bleached and distressed by hand after you place your order.   
***Processing time is currently approximately 2 weeks before your item will be shipped out.

As a mom myself, I know how hard it can be to wait for your order to arrive!
Need help with sizing?
Please refer to the chart below!
Although when in doubt always size up!  Since these jeans have an elastic waist band that can be easily cinched if the waist is a little big and they can be rolled up (if they are a little too long) it is a great idea to size up if your child is between sizes or, if like most parents, you hope for them to wear them for a longer time.  We are no longer able to do exchanges for incorrect sizing so please size up if in doubt!

945,"Antique Victorian Crescent Moon Locket Necklace, Gold Filled Locket, Crescent Moon Flower Spray Locket, Celestial Locket, Pink Springtime","
            Lovely! Springtime collection! 
This antique gold filled locket dates to the Victorian era  (c. - late 1800s to early 1900s). Featuring a lovely crescent moon design with a flower spray on the left side. The moon is made up of (7) clear paste stones. A few have darkened with age.  Etching is nice and sharp, there are (2) pink stones for the center of each flower. Inside it opens to reveal two areas in which to place your keepsake photos. Both frames and plastic covers are intact. It hangs from a new, long gold filled satellite chain -spring clasp closure. Total weight of locket and chain is 14.2 grams.
*Age:
Late 1800s - Early 1900s
*Measurements:
Locket is a little over 1-1/8"" in diameter.
Chain is 22"" in length.
Total weight of locket and chain is 14.2 grams.
*Condition:
In great antique condition. Fully functional - opens and snaps shut securely. Both frames and plastic covers are intact. Minor scratching on front of locket about middle of crescent (pictured). Does not affect the beauty of the piece. Some stones have darkened with age.
*History:
The crescent moon motif locket became popular during the later Victorian period which ran from about 1880 - 1901. The reasoning behind the emergence of this celestial theme was in part due to the great number of astronomical events, such as the appearance of Halley’s Comet during this time frame. In addition, travel to such exotic places as the Middle East and the lands of the Ottoman Empire gave rise to the exposure of the crescent moon as an integrated symbol for the area.
I am in LOVE with these lockets and think they’re absolutely stunning, and I really love the meaning behind each one. I often feel like I am wearing a piece of history when I wear a vintage locket. I wonder who originally wore the locket, what they looked like and what it meant to them. 
When shopping for the holidays or any special occasion, I love finding gifts that are not only unique and thoughtful, but the perfect gift that matches the special person I’m gifting to. I also love having personalized items of my own and there’s nothing better than wearing or using something that is unique to you and expresses who you are or how you feel.

            This is a vintage backgammon set game.  The men are made of wood (beige and brown).  The board is in cardboard red, beige and black colors.  There is also a pair of dice.  The original box is in vintage condition.  I see some transparent scotch tape on the side to protect the box.
After checking the playing instructions, I realize that one (1) brown men is missing.:(  We should have 15 men each player and a pair of dice.  I suggest that you make another round wood men to complete the set :)
After all it is a vintage game that my aunt had since the 70s-80s.  I remember that the adults were playing backgammon at the cottage. :)
Perfect for any vintage game lovers !
Thank you for your interests in my vintage backgammon set game.

            Here is a lovely Pinball game, made of wood with printed paper jungle scene inside (La Jungle), with wild animals.
At the bottom right, there is spring-loaded marble launcher; solid wood frame with particle board back. Little rows of nails catch the marbles and give you a score (hopefully!). There should be a piece of wood to raise the top of the game (so the marbles roll back down), but it is gone.
The paper background is in good condition, with nice colours, although a bit worn in 1 spot around the 180 score (see picture 5).
Also included are 6 painted clay marbles, as seen in picture 5.

1620,Moroccan Kilim Rug - Colorful Boucherouite Rag Carpet - Eco-Friendly Home Design,"
            Handmade from recycled fabrics, this rug is the showstopping centerpiece for any room. It features graphic Berber patterns woven from vibrant red, yellow, light blue, and gray fabric on a cream/light pink background. The upper pile is made from fabric and the base is reinforced with wool. It measures 4'2"" by 7'5.5"" (1.27 m x 2.27 m) and weights 18.6 pounds (8.44 kg).
Boucherouite carpets are a play on the traditional rag rug, but with a vibrant Moroccan twist. These rugs are known for their wild colors and crazy, sometimes psychedelic designs. You'll never find two rugs exactly the same - each is as unique as the woman who made it. Women traditionally constructed boucherouite rugs out of fabric scraps, used clothes, spare wool, and any other materials they could get their hands on. Boucherouite rugs are eco-friendly, made from almost 100% recycled materials. They are colorful, fun, and the perfect complement to both modern and rustic decor.
All of our products were handmade by Berber women, and each carpet is an original work of art. There may be imperfections in the pattern, or the carpets might be slightly longer in one direction. Each carpet has its own character, as you can see in the photos above. Thank you for shopping with Two Camel Carpets!

These measure 72"" wide and 81"" long each. There is some staining on the inside of the very bottom of the hem and there are some wear spots along the top edges. These use the hooks for drapes but they are long enough to cut them down if you wish to make curtains out of them. By doing so this would also eliminate the blemishes on the top and bottom.

I have more than these, and they are all exquisite. The sizes range from 1/2"" to  1  1/2"" diameter, most are plastic in a golden metalized finish,  some are metal, some are shank style and some sew through -  all are vintage. Suitable for a variety of crafts, including jewelry.
The picture is to display most of the buttons available and does not represent the specific lot per se. If you see a button in the picture you can't live without, let me know and if it still available I'll make sure it gets to you :-)
All the buttons come from a smoke and pet free environment, and are new old stock of a store that closed down years ago in the Garment District in NYC. Please read the shop policies before placing your order.
Thanks for looking!

3563,Soviet Bulgarian army coat winter wool USSR military surplus S to XXL,"
            Perfect for winter weather! Vintage Bulgarian Soviet era brown wool jeep jacket with 4 pockets, gathered waist and cotton half lining.
All buttons feature the communist star on them, and epaulettes and collar are trimmed in red.
Both sides of the jacket's waist are gathered with elastic, giving a snug fit at the waist and preventing cold drafts. I wear one of these during the winter, and can testify to their effectiveness at keeping you cosy! 
Made from natural wool, most likely from sheep. These coats weigh over 1kg each.

All items are wrapped with acid-free tissue. No item will ever be sent wrinkled beyond belief in an old plastic grocery bag inside of an old reused marked up envelope as has happened to me by some sellers. I think too much of my customers & my products to do that to anyone. 
All vintage items are just that – vintage & not new straight from the mall– and may show some imperfections, wear and use because of the age. I try to list any imperfection but a small one could slip by unintentionally.
Items are shipped parcel post, priority or first class depending on the weight, destination & what the item is at seller’s discretion. 
Shipping charges do not include insurance & I strongly recommend purchasing insurance for all items.  Contact me before buying & I can add the insurance charge onto your invoice.        ",89.99,4.881,"Vintage item from the 1970s

            VINTAGE TOURMALINE MINK FUR STOLE (Ref: 160602)
DESCRIPTION
This is a gorgeous and luxurious tourmaline or blonde mink fur stole.
The fur is thick and soft. 
It has interesting variations of light and dark shades. The fur closest to the pelt is a light blonde color.
The stole is long, wide, and shaped so that it fits around the neck and shoulders nicely.
It has a clever stitched down collar and long fur pelt tassels at each end.
It is fully lined in light taupe colored satin and has a satin loop on one side so that one end of the stole can be slipped under the loop and be held in place. It also has a single fur clip for the same purpose.
The label on the inside says ""Genuine Natural Mink"".
The stole came in its original department store box (David Jones) with its original tag, original brochure with all sorts of information about buying and caring for fur, original red ribbon, and original tissue paper. The original tag identifies the item as a ""Tourmaline Mink Stole"".
The brand is ""Solmar"", a now defunct Australian company.
It is a beautifully made, high quality item.
It would make a great wrap for a winter wedding or a night out.
MEASUREMENTS
The measurements are taken on the inside along the lining, not the fur.
With the stole folded in half, the inside length (the length that touches the neck) measures 27 inches / 69 cm and the outside length measures 29.5 inches / 75.5 cm.
The stole measures 16 inches / 41 cm wide in the middle and 5.5 inches / 14 cm wide at each end.
The tassels measure 6 inches / 15 cm long.
It is a one size fits most people item.
AGE
The stole is 1950s. 
CONDITION
The stole is in excellent vintage condition and has been stored well. The fur is in beautiful condition and the stole has no tears or rips. It has one mark on the lining that is 1 inch / 2.5 cm square. It is a darker shade of taupe than the rest of the lining. See last photo.
POSTAGE
If you purchase more than one item I combine postage, if possible, and refund any postage overages.
The item will be shipped without its original box because the box adds weight, size, and cost to the shipping and it is just a basic cardboard box. Shipping will be provided by Australia Post.

            This beautiful garden sculpture is from the 1960's. It could be a garden nymph or a garden fairy. There are no wings on this sculpture which lead me to believe that it is a  garden nymph, however, there is a hang up attachment on the back of this sculpture to hang on the wall. I personally do not think this amazing sculpture can be hung on the wall though. This wonderful fairy sculpture is a used item. There are no major chips or scratches on it. I do not know if the previous owner lost the sculptures wings and applied a hang up peice  on the back or it came this way. Regardless, this item is beautiful and would make the most perfect addition to any garden or home. It is very detailed & extremely cute! Anyone looking for that vintage  touch in the home or garden is sure to love this item. It's measurements are:  9 inches tall & 4 inches wide. This sculpture is ready to be shipped. www.creationsbykatieshop.etsy.com        ",22.00,4.9,"Vintage item from the 1960s

            RARE HAND MADE ANTIQUE SILHOUETTE COLLAGE BUTTERFLY ANIMALS and More
I bought an amazing collection of hand made antique silhouettes from an estate about 20 yrs ago and have had them all safely stored in a dry cool smoke free environment for all this time. I had considered framing them all and doing an entire wall of my home with them; however, I have now decided to part with them. Please search for ""silhouette"" in my store to view others. These are rare, wonderful and special, whimsical, unusual and well done.
All of these are on some sort of beige background (a few exceptions) and nearly all have a plastic covering. I am selling them as found. These are not professionally or acid free preserved or mounted. Some have minor discoloration, and my photos show a glare in some from the plastic. The plastic is generally stapled onto the edges.
I would recommend having these professionally remounted. My price reflects these as they are and I am not planning on matting or framing these...I will leave that up to the person or people who buy them.
Approx. 20"" by 13"", collage of several pieces, included a butterfly, floral designs, and animals at the top. VERY COOL!        ",25.00,4.959,"Vintage item from the 1930s

5352,"Signed vintage French folk art, oil on canvas, field of flowers, garden, floral","
            This is a wonderful, signed vintage oil painting from a Paris flea market. It depicts a veritable explosion of flowers in all their brilliant colors, kind of like floral fireworks! The lively brush strokes and thick paint add great texture and energy and really bring the scene to life. The painting is not dated but I would estimate it to be from the latter half of the twentieth century. It is unframed and measures approximately 10.5"" across x 8.75 tall x 0.75"" deep (the depth of the canvas stretcher). 
This piece is in great vintage condition with only minor scratches and some surface dirt that is visible only on the unpainted sides of the canvas. It would make a unique and charming addition to any vintage art collection.

DISCOUNTS:
Very simple. Some of my prices are firm, some aren’t. Those that are firm will be clearly marked, those that aren’t will be open to discount. If Buyer is interested in “a more friendly price” please convo me – I’m very approachable! As my father continues reminded me daily, I’m a dealer, not a collector. I’m here to find new homes for everything in my shop.
HOLDING ITEMS:
24 hours only – no exceptions.
POSTAGE:
…..UNITED STATES – As mentioned.  
USPS Insurance will be added to the postage automatically when the item price is OVER 35 (if Buyer wants insurance on an item under 35, please contact me). Postage/insurance kind of gets skewed when more than 1 item is purchased so when this happens, never fear – if there is a surplus of postage/insurance (1.50 or more) I will refund via the payment method sent; if an underage, I’ll eat.
......OTHER COUNTRIES - If your country is listed in my shipping, then I can take your order.  If it is not, please contact me! There are AGAIN so many new rules and regulations set down for each country that postage needs to be reviewed and calculated for each individual country. There’s no sense in writing a lot of rates down in each of my listings – it’s enough to scare a person. So, if a deal can be struck, then I will amend the listing to show overseas postage and will place a 24 hour hold.
WHY NOW?
Times are tough, I know. Since selling on the Internet is my livelihood I will do anything to strike a deal – I want to STAY in business! I also want to continue to build my rep as a fair minded dealer who offers really nice items to my customers. I believe that if I do this, my customers will return again and again and again. I love doing what I am doing and want to continue to do so till the day my fingers can no longer type on a keyboard.
Again, if any buyer wants a combo of items, please contact me so I can make the amendments.
Welcome to my shop – may your stay be a pleasant one!        ",34.00,4.9806,"Vintage item from the 1970s

5743,Vintage Hair Comb Butterfly Design Faux Tortoiseshell Small Peineta Decorative Hair Comb Art Nouveau B105,"
            Vintage 1950s butterfly peineta, small hair comb,  with butterfly design on faux tortoiseshell plastic.
Mid Century decorative small peineta, or small comb, is made of plastic to imitate the tortoise shell combs of the Victorian age.
Victorian ladies did not cut their hair but needed combs to keep it off their necks and out of their faces. They never wore their hair long out in public.
Modern ladies used small decorative hair combs to hold up their mantillas, or head coverings. 
They are still used today for religious worship and quinceaneras.
This comb is not Victorian and has an Art Nouveau pattern of butterflies.
Made of molded plastic, it is a faux tortoise shell look.
See photos for measurements.
Bought from an estate, preowned.

*GENERAL NOTES*
Please refer to the provided measurements when deciding whether to purchase this item. Vintage sizes vary widely, so the tagged size is often inaccurate. I recommend measuring a garment that you like the fit of, and comparing those numbers to the ones listed above.
I do not dry clean wool or vintage items before shipping. If your item is wool, I would always recommend dry cleaning for proper upkeep of your wool garments, especially when vintage.
Vintage items are old, which means that they will have more signs of age such as yellowing, fading, ink cracking, loose buttons, etc. This is part of buying old clothes. If you do not want this, do not buy vintage clothing.
If a buyer wants to return their item, Return Shipping is payed buy the buyer unless I have outrageously under-described. I try to over-describe, so this should not happen.
I love selling vintage clothes at good prices and I want to be as hospitable as possible, so if you have any questions or requests do not hesitate to ask.
Feel free to buy multiple Items, combined shipping is encouraged.
I will ship as soon as I receive confirmation of payment. Thanks for looking, again feel free to ask any questions you may have.        ",25.00,4.8761,"Vintage item

*NOTE ABOUT OUR VINTAGE FURS
We do NOT believe in the cruelty of animals but, we do appreciate the plight that they went through from the early 1900s to 1960s when fur was at its height in fashion. There is enough fur available from that era to never have to kill another animal again. That is why, instead of letting these items rot and dry up, we refurbish them and add our Portland touch (usually Pendleton Woolen Mills lining if the lining is ruined), new frog closures (if needed), and we also rehydrate the hide if necessary (if heavy shedding is present).

            The Bouvier des Flandres served farmers and cattle merchants in southwest Flanders and on the French northern plain. Bouvier means oxherd in French, although the dogs were more often called Vuilbaard (dirty beard) or Koe Hand (cow dog). Besides its main duty as a cattle drover, the Bouvier was an all-round farm dog, functioning also as a livestock and farm guard and draft dog.
Whether you are looking for a Bouvier des Flandres artwork, a Bouvier des Flandres print or a Bouvier des Flandres gift for yourself or a Bouvier des Flandres lover, you will find that this artwork fits perfectly in any home.
Description of Bouvier des Flandres Artwork - - - - - - -
First, I researched the Bouvier des Flandres breed and then I created each illustration that  reflects the breed's special traits. An owner can display what makes the Bouvier des Flandres unique. 
Designed with love and then carefully matted, this piece comes ready to frame with a gorgeous 1.5” black textured frame making it measure in at 11” x 14” - so it's just the right fit for a standard 11” x 14” frame.
Carefully hand signed and dated, this illustration will be shipped by USPS First Class postage on the day of your order. It takes 3-4 days to land on your doorstop, depending on how fast (or slow!) the postal system is going that week. 
Note:
This is a photo of the illustration and it is a low resolution image. It is printed on archival paper with archival ink so that it will not fade.
Do You Need Something More Customized?
If you want to add your own words or need a different silhouette of a pet, I can do you a customized illustration. This is particularly desired for a mixed breed pet or as a memorial to a loved pet who has left special memories.
Wondering about something else? 
Don't be shy to message me with any questions you might have! I have listed only a small portion of the illustrations that I have created. If you don't see your dog's breed, just visit my website for a complete listing. Look around the rest of my website store for more adorable animal illustrations: http://petart.us        ",25.00,4.9242,"Handmade item

6452,One size pocket / Muggle Born embroidery / cloth diaper / snaps / Little Beasties / adjustable elastic & leg gussets / embroidered diaper,"
            Let your baby proclaim his Muggle pride with this attractive maroon diaper.  Eco-friendly and stylish, this one-size cloth pocket diaper would make an awesome gender neutral baby gift for yourself, geek parents or babies.
Little Beasties diapers are handmade with love using quality materials & construction.
Little Beasties diapers are one size pockets that feature adjustable elastic around the legs & waist. These diapers can be used from birth and grow with the baby: double-reinforced snaps adjust the diaper size both vertically and horizontally.  Another great feature is the leg gussets that help keep messes contained.
Outer layer:  100% cotton
Hidden layer:  PUL (polyurethane laminate) lining protects from leaks
Inner layer:  Super soft alova inner material wicks moisture away from baby's skin
**CPSC compliant.**
Pocket diapers are great because you can adjust the level of absorbency according to baby's needs.  One or more inserts slide into the large pocket opening.  The alova material wicks moisture away from baby and into the insert.
Inserts available as an add-on to your purchase at checkout:
3-layer inserts made by Angela Sokolova at 
www.etsy.com/shop/SewingPro
 It is 13"" x 5"". ""Top layer on each side is constructed with super soft 100% all natural fibers of 5% hemp, 55% bamboo, 40% organic cotton fleece.This ensures that moisture will be wicked away from your bundle of joy. Middle layer of non-woven absorbent fabric is added for maximum absorption, to soak up and retain liquids.""

6825,Colorful Mario Question Mark Block Lamp - Nintendo roots,"
            If Mario already lights up your life, why not give him a shot at the end table too?
Very colorful and unique lamp is made of a quarter inch maple plywood frame, colored translucent acrylic to give the center question mark a nice shine, and colored heavy construction paper to add a bit of texture to the bricks on either side.
Features:
- This is our largest lamp at 16.5"" x 5.5"" x 5.5""
- Energy efficient bulb included, standard base size
- Long 15' cord capable of hanging the lamp, standard base size (It's the HEMMA kit from Ikea)
- Two openings for easy wall mounting on back of lamp
Perfect for a kid's room, as well as those who still think they are kids (which is very okay, I definitely have one of these over my desk). Ships fully assembled with one bulb in the US and Canada. For over seas purchases, its worth noting that the lamp has a North American outlet plug, so an adapter will be needed if you live in a region with different electrical standards.
Please only use fluorescent bulbs with the lamp, as standard incandescent bulbs create much much more heat, and can occasionally cause warping if the lamp is left on for an extended period of time.
Each lamp will be assembled and shipped within 3 to 5 business days. We make them all to order with buckets of love and care.        ",59.00,4.9084,"Handmade item

            Trade out your pet's disposable bedding for a snuggly, and reusable option! Fleece cage liners are 100% machine washable and reusable! Gone are the days of spending money on countless bags of paper bedding and wood shavings!
These fleece cage liners are made with 100% polyester fleece and have UHAUL padding sandwiched in between for absorbency. The top layer of fleece features your choice of patterned material, while the bottom layer boasts a coordinating solid. ***If you have a coordinating color preference, please note your choice of solid in the ""Notes to Seller"" section before checkout. If left unspecified, a coordinating color will be chosen for you.***
Have another design or color scheme in mind? Send me a convo and have a CUSTOM ORDER made JUST FOR YOU. 
Need a custom size that's not listed? Specify your dimensions in ""notes to seller"" and have a liner made to YOUR EXACT CAGE SIZE.
Liners fit cages with the following dimensions:
1x2 C&C - 14""x28""
2x2 C&C - 28""x28""
2x3 C&C - 28""x43""
2x4 C&C - 28""x58""
Midwest Cage - 24""x47""
***For hygienic purposes, cage liners do not come prewashed. Liners are made 2-3 inches larger in length and width to account for any shrinkage that may occur in the first washing and drying cycles. This ensures that you don't end up with a liner that is too small for your cage!
All items are handmade with love in a 100% SMOKE FREE environment. 
Fleece Use and Care:
Before first use: Machine wash and tumble dry on low or hang to dry. (*Make sure you DO NOT use fabric softener or dryer sheets) Repeat the wash and dry cycle 2 to 3 more times in order to break down the fleece's waterproof barrier and allow moisture to wick into the inner layer. Adding vinegar to the wash cycle helps this process.
To test if your fleece is ready to use: Place a drop of water onto the surface of the fleece. If the water disappears into the fabric, the liner is ready to use! If the water beads and remains on top of the fleece, repeat the wash and dry cycle then retest.
Change out your fleece liner every 4 days to 1 week of use. Before washing it's recommended to brush pet hair and debris from the liner to keep your washing machine free of gunky buildup. Wash on warm cycle with your regular detergent (make sure your detergent does not have a fabric softener additive). Vinegar can be added to the wash cycle to help neutralize any odors. Tumble dry on low or hang to dry. Remember, DO NOT USE FABRIC SOFTENERS OR DRYER SHEETS as these will replace the waterproof barrier and prevent moisture wicking.        ",25.00,4.9836,"Handmade item

7242,Chicken Coop Plans - New England Cape Style Poultry Duck PDF - House 6 Hens in Style - Easy Build DIY,"
            Are you tired of paying high prices for fresh organic eggs ? 
Have you always wanted a few chickens of your own ? 
Do you want to be more self-sufficient but have given up hope of ever having your own backyard chickens due to limited space ? 
Don't want to worry about salmonella ? 
Then building this coop and raising your own backyard chickens is the answer to your dreams!
EASY Do-It-Yourself
4' x6' CHICKEN COOP PLANS 
PDF FILE
(large enough for 6-8 chickens, or even a few more if they have a large run or yard by day)
Materials cost approximately 250.
_____________________________________________________________
PDF Plans will be available via a PDF file upon payment and include: 
Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions including full-color progress photographs
Complete Illustrated Cutting Diagrams
Materials List/Cost Estimate
Full color photographs of the finished coop from various angles
____________________________________
EASY WEEKEND PROJECT !!!!!
The solid, raised construction, numerous wire-mesh vents  and compact size make this coop a comfortable, safe home for your chickens - winter and summer/rain or shine. 
Cleanup is easily accomplished from outside - no crawling inside the coop - using the hinged roof access. Three exterior nesting boxes also with a hinged roof make gathering eggs easy.
____________________________________________________ 
Using just basic tools - circular saw, jigsaw, hammer, electric drill/screwdriver, etc. you can easily build this coop over the course of a weekend.
 
Painted a pretty barn red, teal, or the color of your choice with a cedar shingle hinged roof and black barn hinges, the coop is attractive as well as functional. The vinyl linoleum floor inside is ready to be covered with shavings/straw and along with the hinged coop roof makes cleaning a breeze. With metal mesh air vents and three nesting boxes also with a hinged roof, the coop will make a comfortable and safe home for your chickens winter and summer.
The coop measures 4' x 6' not including the nesting boxes - large enough for 6-8 chickens to fit comfortably, or several more if all they do is sleep in it - and has three attached nesting boxes (each approximately 12"" square) with a hinged lid to collect the eggs without having to go inside, two roosts, side air vents with latching doors, a latching front round vent and a latched door with a ramp for your chickens to get in and out. The coop also has a hinged roof for easy access for cleaning, refilling food and water.
 
Original plans, designed by me in the spring of 2009.

These are also great for party favors.
Choose any 10 body safe fragrances available from Suzy's Scent Shop
Size: 1 oz jar. Net wt of product is 1.5 oz
Scent: Choose Your Own
Suzy’s Scent Shop whipped sugar scrubs are great for exfoliating your skin. They leave your skin healthy and soft.  The scrubs are emulsified so the ingredients don’t separate and it’s whipped to give it a bit of fluffiness.   
Great for extremely dry areas or all over. 
To use, wet the skin, scoop out the amount you would like to use, gently rub in a circular motion, and rinse.  Your skin will feel so great!
Can be used daily. I tend to use it just a few days a week.
I love using them right before I shave.  
A paraben formaldehyde free preservative is used in this product because of the likelihood of water getting into the product. Once water is introduced to a product, mold could grow and we don’t want that.
Available in three sizes, 1 oz, 4 oz, and 8 oz.
You won't find this scrub anywhere else!  The formula was made by me.

            This set is a luxurious, pampering treat for anyone! Great as a gift, or stocking stuffer.

Each jar is labeled with scent name and full ingredients list. 
Basic Ingredients: distilled water × glycerin × sorbitol × sodium cocoyl isethionate × disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate × sodium chloride × phenoxyethanol × tetrasodium edta × sweet almond oil × fragrance ×
~~What is Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap?~~
In culinary terms, creme fraiche is a thick, rich, velvety cream. Savor's whipped soap is a bubbly interpretation of this French specialty.
Fans of Savor's Creme Fraiche enjoy the fluffy texture -- I use care not to whip too much air into the cream so that just a dab goes a long way. Using a bath pouf creates the best lather, and it's so versatile it can be used as a shaving cream, bubble bath, or even a shampoo on certain hair types!
I never use parabens as a preservative, and the Creme Fraiche contains no petroleum products. 
Best used within 6 months of receipt. Oil separation and color changes may occur over time.
~~Packaging~~
The label is highly water-resistant but please take care not to scratch it roughly when wet. I package Creme Fraiche in recyclable plastic jars with lined lids to minimize leaks during shipping. Each jar is shrink-wrapped with a perforated band that you can easily peel off.

This listing includes one egg stamp with the option of a food grade ink pad -or- a non-toxic ink pad.
Please scroll through all of the photos to see the difference in food-grade and non-toxic ink. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me! 
For stamping tips, watch ""How to Use Your Egg Stamp"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xqowb5F0XY
*~*~*~*~* Egg stamps measure approximately .75"" tall by up to 1"" wide (stamp width depends on length of wording), and work best when used on room temperature eggs. I have found that I get the cleanest impressions when I ink the stamp, blot it on a piece of paper to remove excess ink, then stamp the egg in a rolling motion. *~*~*~*~*
Stamps can be used by children, but I suggest opting for a simple design as stamping the eggs requires a steady & careful hand. (Monograms work well!)
During the checkout process, please make note of any customization requests you have in 'notes to seller'; please specify exactly what you'd like the stamp to say (Mackintosh coop, Mackintosh eggs, Mackintosh, etc...). You will be emailed a proof within 48 hours; after approval, please allow 10 business days for your stamp to arrive.

8022,Red Ceramic Pomegranate Art / Judaica Gift for Passover / Holy Land/Jewish Home Decoration/Symbol Abundance & Fertility/Housewarming Hostess,"
            This listing is for one pomegranate. 
They look great in a group as you can see in the photos. Or keep it in the kitchen or on a desk as a pencil or pen holder.
The juicy, red, sweet pomegranate fruit is considered a symbol of good luck,abundance, fertility and beauty. It's probably because it has a lot of seeds and sections, which symbolize the many good qualities and deeds that each one of us has done. Because of the beauty of the fruit and symbolic values​​, it is commonly sculptured and drawn for decoration. 
This handful-sized ceramic pomegranate is the perfect Judaica gift for Jewish holidays or simply a beautiful gift for a host, engagement gift or any occasion. 
Here's how I make the pomegranates:
1. beautiful pomegranates are picked from the pomegranate tree in my garden
2. I copy them into casting molds that will save the shape forever
3. From the mold, I cast a new hollow pomegranate with white clay
4. I then hand-paint it with deliciously red glaze.
5. I sign it on the bottom
Size 
Cercumference: approx. 13-1/3 inches (33-35 cm)
Height: approx. 4-1/3 inches (11-12 cm)
What my customers are saying about my pomegranates:
★★★★★ ""Beautifully hand made and wrapped, they look better than real fruit!""  
★★★★★ ""My ceramic pomegranate is gorgeous and looks just like the photo! Very friendly service! I'm happy!""
Crazy about pomegranates? Me too!

DETAILS:
• Because this is wood from a real tree, pieces may have knots which we try to place in the best spots possible for the photo provided.
• Each piece of wood will vary in wood grain, making each one completely unique.
• Measuring anywhere from 9"" to 12"" in width or height, depending on the direction of your photo.
• Photos will be cropped slightly around the corners/edges, as this is the only way to fit a rectangular photo onto an oval piece of wood. All important aspects of the photo should not be located along the very edges of the picture.
• Horizontal photos will be placed horizontally on the wood & vertical photos will be placed vertically unless otherwise requested.
• White ink is not printed on the wood. This allows the natural grain of the wood to show through the photo. Colors of the photo on the wood may vary slightly. 
• A clear protective coating is applied over your wood photo to help protect against stains, water and scratching.
• All wood photos come with complimentary hardware for hanging.
• The bark of the wood is not removed from the wood in order to preserve the natural look of our wood photos.
• All orders are securely packaged with extra bubble wrap for added protection during shipping. 
• Made and Handcrafted in Virginia, U.S.A
CHOOSING YOUR PHOTO:
• The better quality the photo, the better the results will be on the wood.
• A 300 dpi photo taken in good lighting will give you the best possible print results.
• Lower quality photos can be used, but please know that the quality will be the same on the wood.
• Extremely dark, blurry, grainy or low-quality photos do not typically transfer well.
• We ask that you DO NOT add any text to your photo, due to cropping reasons.
• We recommend printing your original photo from your home printer at the full page size to get an idea of how the colors (these may vary slightly) & quality will look on the wood.

8401,The Flower Murrini Tutorial- By Astrid Riedel,"
            ""The Flower Murrini"" 
It is my pleasure to show you how to make my flower murrinis, I hope that you will feel inspired by the process and will create out of the simple steps shown in the tutorial many more flowers of your own design. 
My intention with this tutorial is to make it possible for anyone to be able to create a beautiful flower murrini, to understand the principle design elements and to apply them to other flowers.
You often hear how it can take 8 hours or more to create a Tonbodama style flower murrini, and although I admire that, I find that most of us really don’t want to spend that much time on this.
I really wanted to develop a way to make the whole process easier and faster but at the same time still create a complex looking flower. 
And so I present to you this collection of flower murrini, we will start the tutorial with the easiest flower and work to the more advanced flowers, step by step.
The tutorials are written in mind for the intermediate/advanced bead maker. Good heat control is essential to achieve the desired results. 
Easy to follow photographs will lead you through the tutorial. With each photograph, there are concise written explanations.
In addition to learning how to make great flower murrinis, I have also added a full tutorial  demonstrating how to apply the murrini to the bead, In both the making of the murrini and the application I have developed my own techniques to bring out the beauty and the mystery of the flower murrinis. 
The 5 individual tutorials comprises of: 
An introduction 
Materials and tool requirements 
Glass requirements
Part 1 the Daisy flower
Part 2 the Daffodil flower
Part 3 the Anemone flower
Part 4 the Pink daisy flower
Part 5 the Application of the flower murrinis
The tutorials are available as instant download as soon as payment is made.
Unfortunately I cannot accept any returns, due to the fact that is digital information.
If you have any question please contact me.
Please respect my work and efforts not to copy or forward it to any other person. 
These tutorials are for your personal benefit to increase your skills and not to TEACH or be used in workshops. Thank you :) 
                                                              Astrid Riedel        ",25.00,4.9655,"Handmade item

Lovely, Soft, and Large!
Historically, powder puffs have been made from various fine feathers, luscious wools, or poofy cotton. I wanted to bring you a historical powder puff that was really versatile, soft, and able to handle a lot of powder for the body or hair. Merino Wool has been around for centuries. It was highly prized and would have been very much cherished. This puff would work for your historical toilette from the Middle Ages through today.
History on Merino Wool:
It was highly valued already in the Middle Ages. Today, Merinos are still regarded as having some of the finest and softest wool of any sheep. Before the 18th century, the export of Merinos from Spain was a crime punishable by death. 
In the 18th century, small exportation of Merinos from Spain and local sheep were used as the foundation of Merino flocks in other countries. In 1723, some were exported to Sweden, by 1774 to Saxony, 1775 to Hungary and to Prussia in 1786. In 1786, Louis XVI of France received 366 sheep selected from 10 different cabañas. In 1802, Colonel David Humphreys, United States Ambassador to Spain, introduced the Vermont strain into North America. The British embargo on wool and wool clothing exports to the U.S. prior to the 1812 British/U.S. war led to a ""Merino Craze"" and everyone wanted Merino Wool.
Care for your puff: Feel free to shake your puff out or gently comb through it to remove any excess powder.        ",25.00,4.9266,"Handmade item

9205,"Blade Fidget Spinner Toys, Stress Relief, A.D.D.  Idle Hands","
            Are you a pen clicker? Shaking your foot? Always grabbing something to play with? Well this is just what you need to keep your hands busy.
I'm sure you already know what these are. And I had a couple myself. Then I decided to make my own, a Blade design in 4 flavors (Hopefully more to come)
First, pick a frame design.
                                  2 Blade, 3 Blade, 4 Blade, 5 Blade. 
Then, pick the color you want it to be.
(please see my other listings as I try to get pictures of all my colors so you will know what they look like)
The center button/finger guards will be attached to all spinners, If you would like a 2-tone and change the color of the center button, let me know at time of order in the notes to seller. Otherwise the order will default to match colors. 
If there is a color you are looking for and I do not have, please feel free to message me, and I will see what I can do to get you a spinner of the color you desire!
Please check back regularly, I have been in the process of creating more designs!
They are almost 3 1/2"" diameter, and made from PLA plastics which is environmentally friendly!
Please note: These are fidget spinners not basketballs. Repeatedly dropping them on hard surfaces like concrete will break them. This is especially so with more bearings, heavier units and exotic designs. If butterfingers are a concern, I highly suggest checking out my Ninja Star designs as they are by far more durable when accidently dropped on hard surfaces.        ",5.50,4.6,"Handmade item

9773,Viking board games Tafl (Hnefatafl) and Nine Man Morris,"
            This is a two sided board game set that has Hnefatafl (more commonly known as Tafl) on one side, and Nine Man Morris on the other.  The board is made from hand colored duck cloth fabric, so no two are the same (the photo shows a typical stain coloring).  The images on the boards are hand printed, and given a slightly distressed look.  The set comes with all the pieces to play both games, as well as instructions.
Tafl is an ancient Viking board game that was the most played game in Europe prior to the introduction of chess.  It is identified in the Viking Sagas as an important element for a warrior to learn and play well in order to become successful.  It is also one of a very few games that has an uneven player starting point.  The ""Swedes"" are out numbered two to one by ""Muscovites"" at the start of the game.  It is a very fun, and interesting game, with different strategies for each side.
Nine Man Morris is an ancient game from Rome that is often found on the back of Tafl boards.  It is a very fast paced game that has some similarities to checkers.
The board is approximately 11"" by 15"" and the playing pieces are approximately 3/4"" each.        ",25.00,4.8939,"Handmade item

This premium case is made from a high quality, tough polycarbonate plastic. Ink is impregnated into the plastic with a heat bonding sublimation process leaving the glossy surface durable and easy to clean. No stickers are used and the ink will not wipe off. The case is fully printed with the design wrapping around the sides. The oval camera openings have been shaped carefully to prevent interfering with the iPhone flash.
SLIM
The slim case is sleek and lightweight adding minimal bulk to your device. Each hard shell case is precision made to fit just right. It fits your phone perfectly and cannot be used with a liner. All ports are clear and open for easy access. The front edge is raised slightly to protect the screen when laying your phone flat on it’s face, pretty side up.
TOUGH
For more shock absorbency, upgrade to the Tough case with an added TPU liner. The liner can be seen around the edges of the plastic shell. The raised bumper adds a bit of screen protection. TPU is a rubbery plastic that is resistant to oil and grease and will not interfere with your phone’s reception. Cutouts in the liner and soft touch button covers allow access to all of your phone’s ports and functions. The outer shell of the tough case is a tad bigger than the slim to have room for all this goodness, and cannot be used without the liner.
White liners are now available for iPhone 6, 6S, 7, 6 Plus and 6S Plus and 7 Plus Tough cases. All other device types have only black liners. 
Choose your device and style of case - Slim, TOUGH white or TOUGH black - from the drop down menu when purchasing.

Choose your device from the option drop-down menu. 
A - HARDCASE (Standable Case)- hard cover for your tablet made using a light yet durable corrugated plastic core. Lightly padded and covered with decorative fabric. Velcro closure. STANDING PART- I use a long strip of velcro so that there is a wide range of viewing angles.  Complimentary camera grommet is included in models with back facing camera. (Exact placement cannot be guaranteed. I do print out a to-scale photo of the back of your device to use for placement.) 
LAMINATION ADD-ON: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/206466758/
- FABRIC PLACEMENT MAY VARY- Images are made from scans of the fabric to show approximately what the case will look like. The scale of the design will be different depending on the size of your case. If a large design will not work on a smaller tablet I will let you know. I do place the fabric on each case so that it looks the best. INSIDE fabric will probably vary from the picture. At the time of production I choose what looks best from my huge collection of solids, prints, tonals and hand dyed fabrics. COLOR MAY VARY due to variations in monitors, computers, dye lots of fabric etc. I try to convey the colors as best as I can. Colors shown on devices with enhanced display such as Apple or Galaxy products will appear more vivid than in real life.

Phone is in perfect vintage condition!
Few people know that in the Soviet Union prior to 1968, the telephone numbers were not just numbers but also letters. And first phones dialer did not exist. In the book ""the List of subscribers of the Moscow telephone network"" in 1916 the first paragraph of the rules of using phones reads: ""the Central station is called simply by lifting the microtelephone from the cradle. Duty station should respond by telling you your room. Then the caller loudly and clearly reports the number with which communication is required"".
On the first disk devices were only numbers. In 20-e years of the last century next to the figures depicted letters. In the USSR on the phone next to the number was also 10 letters: A, B, C, G, D, E, F, I, K, L (А, Б, В, Г, Д, Е, Ж, И, К, Л). the Letter Z (З) is not used, because it is similar to the three.

10018,Custom Magic: the Gathering (mtg) Life Counter [Base Price],"
            Be the coolest MtG player around with one of these abacus-style life counters! These also make great, unique gifts for MtG lovers!
I can create a life counter out of any existing Magic: the Gathering cards, with any style/color beads. A lot of time and energy goes into making these; unfortunately the photographs can't quite capture the full 3-dimensional effect. These also work great as EDH/Commander generals, with a counter that can keep track of how many times they've been cast (like the Captain Sisay & Hanna, Ship's Navigator pictured).
Not sure what you want? Want something other than Magic cards? Contact me and I'd be happy to discuss ideas with you!
HOW TO ORDER:
~Choose the card you wish to be used for your life counter (please be aware that the price listed is for labor ONLY, the value of the cards will be added to your total upon completion).
~Please contact me BEFORE ordering to discuss details about the order including the cards to be used, bead preferences, etc. as well as to get a price quote. You can contact me by messaging me here on Etsy or emailing me at  Quidora_64 [!at] yahoo.com
~Once all details have been worked out and a price is determined, I will complete the counter before putting up a separate listing for your order here on Etsy.
Please note:
~This listing is for a single 3D life counter; the price listed is for the labor ONLY, additional cost may be added based on the value of cards chosen or the necessity of rush shipping.
~This is a CUSTOM order; you will not be receiving any of the items photographed here, unless you order one to those specifications.
~Please allow about 2-3 weeks for your purchase to arrive. This time accounts for: (a) ordering all cards and other supplies necessary for production, (b) the creation of the life counter, and (c) shipping time.
~If you need a counter by a specific time, please let me know when you contact me. I can usually accommodate rush orders but please note that this is not always possible. In addition, please note that the price for your counter may be higher under these circumstances due to higher postage and/or an inability to acquire the necessary cards at their lowest price available.

10167,My Greatest Catch Fishing Lure - Personalized Fishing Lure - Groom Gift - Anniversary - Birthday Gift - Gifts for Him - Custom Fishing Lure,"
            Personalized Fishing Lures - You're My Greatest Catch with Date by Pink Lemon Design
I'm so in love with these custom fishing lures!  Perfect gifts for him or her!
The spinner part of the lure is made with a highly polished nontarnishable aluminum and is gently curved (picture 2).  Edges of this lure are smooth but can be hammered (see picture 2) to catch the light.  This lure is not just for show, it's completely functional!  It includes a high carbon steel treble hook (size 8) and a barrel swivel with interlocking snap.
❋ To personalize:  Please include the date you would like stamped in the Notes to PinkLemonDesign box when checking out. (picture 3)
~
❋ A quick note about my process
This piece is cut and each letter individually hand stamped by me. The process of hand stamping involves using a hammer and steel stamps to impress letters, numbers and symbols onto metal. While I try to be consistent, there may be variations in spacing, alignment and depth of letters. Simply, this adds the charm to the art hand stamping. :) I am definitely my own worst critic, though, and will never let something go out that I'm not 100% happy with.  The stamped piece will not tarnish, rust, discolor, etc., nor will it leave marks on your skin.
~

            Fishing / Personalized Fishing Lure / Custom Fish Gift / For Husband / Mens Gift / Copper / Bronze Heart / Anniversary / Man / Boyfriend Groom / Greatest Catch
This custom fishing lure is our ""most popular"" Etsy gift! The personalized fishing lure is pictured in antiqued brass in frames 1-3 and in bronze in frames 4-5.  These lures can also be purchased in antiqued copper or stainless steel.  
These fishing lures are 100% handmade from start to finish in our small home shop. Each lure is made by hand cutting the metal into the shape of a heart. Each is then further shaped and fine tuned to eliminate rough edges. They are all given a one of a kind distressed, antiqued and varied finish.  All are then brushed and polished. They are personalized with hand stamping. Each letter is carefully hammered into the metal - one by one. The spacing and depth of the letters can vary - since this is not done by a machine. These differences make every item completely one of a kind. It should be noted that our lures can only be hand stamped on one side, not both. Finally the lures are finished off by adding swivels, split rings and hooks. They have a slight bend to them, which allows them to spin in the water - making them not only super unique, but also effective for fishing! We are proud to offer a handcrafted item for your special occasion that was made in the USA. 
These lures can be purchased with no message or with a custom message as shown in the example (as long as it fits).  Just add your message request in the notes to seller box at checkout and make sure you choose the price option of Personalized in the drop downs at checkout.      
The heart can be hand stamped with many, many customized phrases. Some ideas are: FATHER OF THE BRIDE, FATHER OF THE GROOM, HOOKED and ANNIVERSARY DATE, BEST MAN and DATE, ALWAYS AND FOREVER, CAUGHT and DATE, WITH LOVE and NAME, XOXO and INITIALS. If you have another idea, please don't hesitate to ask as we are happy to customize to your wishes. 
Please contact me regarding bulk orders for weddings and favors as we may be able to offer a price break depending on the quantity purchased.

10452,Zine: SELF-LOVE // poetry / prose / perzine // handmade zine / handwritten zine // journal excerpts,"
            In March 2013 I made a zine about self-love. What is it? How do I love myself currently? How can I love myself better?
In February 2015 -- on Valentine's Day, in fact! -- I revised the zine by adding new content and new sketches. Revising the zine was, in itself, a form of self-love. It emphasised the value of my voice and my thoughts. It reminded me of the little things I like to do, the little things that calm my mind and settle my heart. It forced me to look at parts of my body and consider them worthy of attention and admiration. Here is the revised zine. Enjoy.

            ***Please note: the size of this camera strap cover is 3.25"" WIDE x 38"" LONG. PLEASE MEASURE YOUR CURRENT FACTORY STRAP TO ENSURE THIS WILL FIT OVER IT. The lens cap pocket will fit a cap sized up to 2.50"" in diameter (if you shoot with a lens greater than 58mm in ring size (aka filter size) please convo me so we can customize your strap to fit the bigger lens cap., i.e. 67mm, 72mm. The cap used to measure the pocket space in the photos is a 58mm filter.) 
This listing is for a peachy/coral flowers on teal print camera strap and is suitable for most DSLR cameras. This strap has a peach backside and lens cap pocket that is monogrammed in teal thread and is lightly padded for extra comfort. 
*For the three letter monogram option (picture 4) please indicate in the note to seller box the initials in the order that they will appear on the monogram. You can chose the upper case letter with the swirls or lower case letter seen to the right of the upper case letter in the photo for the style of the center initial on your monogram. The ""D"" on this camera strap is the lower case option without all the swirls on the ""D"" letter as shown in picture 4. The lower case option is for those not wanting a super swirly font. So for this you would pick lower case and all letters will be the lower case style. If you pick upper case then the center initial will have the swirls and be flanked by two lower case initials. 
If you have any questions, please message me and we can work on your monogram together.    
 
***pictures of font choices are embroidery files purchased from the itch2stitch. 
****Each camera strap is handmade and the fabric pattern varies with each item when the fabric is cut.
To install: 
1) Disconnect one end of your camera's strap from the camera body
2) Take the largest safety pin you can find and attach it to your camera's strap
3) Insert it in one end of the camera strap cover and begin to thread it through the strap
4) When it is all the way through, remove the pin and reattach the camera strap to the camera body
5) Enjoy!

            Every laptop user must have had an experience of holding the device on the lap. And it must be not the most pleasant experience in life. It lacks comfort and safety. Desk is certainly better. However, it cannot be carried around along with the portable computer. 
Mobile lap desk is an alternative to both your desk and your lap. It offers a stable and spacious surface. Importantly, it absorbs the heat generated. Thus, it a comfortable and healthy way to use your laptop anywhere.
The item is embodied in solid oak wood with cork wood fragment that serves as working surface of the mouse. Holes ensure proper cooling of your device and help precent overheating. Gutter in the top part of the lap desk allows placing other portable devices on it (such as tablets or smartphones).
Enjoy working on your laptop wherever you are. Reliability of the desk available even on your comfy sofa.

This is a hardcover book. The book has 120 pages, and a publishing date of 1972.
The outside page edges around the book are slightly discolored and the top page edges are spotted.

This is a vintage book, and has some wear to it. There is an owners name and address written on the front page, although the name is crossed out.

You will also receive a PDF of my Etsy SEO Guide called ""The Secret to SEO"" and I will teach you each step of the plan and how to apply it to your shop
ALL NEW: Exclusive access to the Secret to SEO Facebook group where I will break down what's trending with Etsy Featured and give you the direct keyword phrases to bring people into your shop! Must have a Facebook account in order to participate in this feature. Group will open on January 1st!
I am an Etsy seller; I don't make a living from trying to sell SEO services. What this means to you is that I practice what I teach. I started teaching this SEO product because once the SEO process clicked for me~~~my sales totals soared and I was so excited about that so I wanted to reach out and share my newfound knowledge with sellers I knew! I have been teaching specifically Etsy SEO successfully with this guide for over 2 years with bootcamps within Teams on Etsy and Etsy based Facebook groups and have seen many many shops go on to great success using this method. 
I will send an email after purchase to your email on file with Etsy detailing what reports I need in order to get started and to have you choose your listings to be worked on. If I do not receive the requested info back within 5 business days from sending the email (or an email telling me when they will be received), I will proceed to choose 5 listings and optimize them for you.
Also, I will teach you how and where I received the information from so that going forward, if you choose, you will be able to optimize listings on your own. My ultimate goal is to help each seller create a healthy store which in turn creates a healthy marketplace which benefits ALL sellers! I always say my job isn't to feed Etsy sellers, but to teach them how to fish and armed with the information I will give you, this should be exactly what you will be able to do! Once you have received your listings back and implemented the new tags and titles, I will also promote each of the listings you sent me to help your tags and titles get a boost!
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me!
some reviews of my boot camp:
Kat from 
invintageheaven.etsy.com
 said """"Taking the Secret to SEO bootcamp really boosted my business and my sales from being found in Search have increased so much since then!""
""Activity in my Etsy shop, Carla's Craft, was always hit or miss (more miss than hit, actually). Understanding how SEO works, particularly in the Etsy environment, has helped me to better promote my art and my sales have increased as I've put the steps in place. Many thanks to Jen B. for sharing her experiences!"" Carla B.
Melinda W. said ""For the first several months after opening my shop, I struggled with low sales, low views, and what I perceived to be a lack of customer interest in my products. 
Recently, I reached out to Jen B. for help because I had heard that she was very knowledgeable about SEO that is specific to Etsy and crucial to being found by customers. I applied what I had learned to several of my listings and the results were almost immediate!
My average daily views are now triple what they were before, I have daily sales, and I am about to hire my first employee!
I highly recommend Jen B's services to anyone who is serious about selling on Etsy. It is hands-down the best thing I have done for my business.""        ",25.00,4.8472,"Handmade Supply

Edge wear, especially along the spine, with a chip at the upper left corner of the front panel. Some scuffing to the reverse panel. Bookplate on inside front cover and owners name in blue ink on the front free endpaper, otherwise a very clean interior and tight binding. 
About Paul Rand:
Probably best known for his iconic IBM logo and identity system of 1956, graphic designer Paul Rand virtually singlehandedly was responsible for changing the way American graphic artist worked in the mid-twentieth century. Highly influenced by modern artists, especially the Surrealists, Rand was known for ""defamiliarizing the ordinary"" as well as for his simplified typography and breaking from graphic convention. Typical ""Rand-isms"" include torn paper collage, handwritten type, and the use of stripes as a graphic element.
Rand's oeuvre included designs for corporate identities and logos, books and book covers, posters, advertisements, and countless other applications of ink to flat surfaces.

Real Leaf bracelet, Silver Leaf bracelet, Natural Leaf bracelet, Sterling Silver leaf, Silver dipped leaf, Real leaf jewelry, Silver bracelet
A favorite of my friends and buyers (and a steal at this price), each of these bracelets is unique in that they’re made from real leaves plated in silver. Very light and flexible, they can be made to fit any wrist, and in addition to everyday use, they’re excellent as a bridal piece or bridesmaids’ accessories. Makes a fantastic, affordable gift!   
Please note that the leaves are real; there cannot be two identical leaves. Therefore each bracelet is one of a kind and shows the distinct lines and markings of each unique leaf. Please allow for slight variations, although the size and shape will be very close to what is shown in the photo above.
This bracelet designed to fit any wrist,  though you'll still need to choose the size of your wrist to make it a perfect fit.
Comes with 3mm rhodium plated chain and a little clear quartz bead charm. Pearl and opalite charms are unavailable at the the moment.
Your jewelry will come in a gift bag!

○Description
Elegant table numbers laser cut to precision.  We do things a little different here at the shop. We make our products with your interest in mind. We design based on your needs and not the cheapest route. That's why we have these numbers with 10 inch sticks.
○When Ordering
If you purchase the unfinished numbers they will arrive unfinished which means not painted.  
○ Materials
We cut all of our numbers from 1/4 Baltic birch plywood which is one of the strongest woods on the market. For our painted numbers we spared no expense and use Modern Masters Metallic paints for what we feel is the highest quality available 
○Sizes not including stick
Widths range from 4 1/2 to 9 1/2 for a number like nineteen
Heights range from the smallest 1 1/8 to just under 4 1/2 for a number like twenty four
Sticks will add another 10 inches - If a different length stick is needed we also do custom sizes. Please contact us for more details and pricing

*MONOGRAM GUIDELINES:
Here are a few general guidelines for monogramming to make it easier for you:
For a Married Couple (or soon to be):
The monogram will contain the bride's first initial, the surname of the couple, and the groom's first initial, in that order. For instance Jennifer and Kyle Smith will be JSK
Monogramming a Gift for a Woman:
A monogrammed gift for a woman should include her first, middle and last initial or if she is married, her first, maiden name, and married name initials. Traditionally, a woman's monogram is presented in first, last, middle initial order. So for Gabriella Marie Smith, it will be GSM
Monogramming a Gift for a Man:
For men's gifts, it is very important to consider the shape of the item to be monogrammed when choosing the order of the initials. When monogramming something for a man, many people prefer to use the initials in the first, middle and last order when all the letters are the same height. For example, Robert John West will be RJW (all letters same height).  Or when the letter in the middle is bigger, you can use the same tips for a woman - first, last and middle initials (Robert John West's will be RWJ if the middle is taller than the other two initials)        ",25.00,4.9483,"Handmade item

The 22 page booklet, written by Amanda Houston, begins with an introduction to brush lettering terms, and takes you through the basic strokes used in a brush script. You will then be guided through each letter of the alphabet, in a modern calligraphy script style, with a final section on ""bringing it all together"" with word examples to follow, so you are fully capable of producing beautiful words when you are finished. Within the booklet, there is lined space designated for practicing each stroke and letter, as well as free space at the end to practice your new skills. The entire booklet is made up of a smooth, silk paper, that is meant to preserve the life of your pens. It is spiral bound, and can be used time and time again for reference to the basics, and practice prompts.

            - Please note this item is an INSTANT DIGITAL DOWNLOAD -
When I made a Vintage Caravan Sewing Machine Cover and posted a picture of it on my blog, I received a surprising number of requests for a pattern - and here it is!
This Download includes:
1 - The Introduction
2 - The Pattern Pieces
3 – The Tutorial
The files are in pdf format.
The finished size of this cover is: 20"" X 13"" X 9""
To print to the correct size, please select ‘Scale 100%’ or ‘Scaling None’ on your printer.
If anything doesn't make sense or doesn't work as expected, please contact me and we will try to resolve it. I would also very much appreciate any other feedback you may have and, of course, if you make a Caravan, I would love to see a picture.
Please note that this pattern is written in English.
Errata: In the Tutorial, step 31 for the Windows, it says: ""Take two window part 2 pieces and sew to the top and bottom of window...etc"". This should say ""Take two window part 4 pieces which would be the window frame top and bottom pieces"".
This Pattern (including any accompanying text or pictures) may not be reproduced or distributed without permission. Neither may items be mass produced. You may, however, sell the items that you personally make using this pattern. Please give design credit to Janine at: http://www.rainbowhare.com

Discover a new wire crochet technique I have developed, the ISK (Invisible Spool Knitting)!
This is not the standard crochet you have been used to; trying to find the right wording for it, the most accurate appears to be the ISK, a technique with which you will create designs that look like knitting, while using a crochet hook.

If you do not want the color pictured on the display photograph please review the color wheel pictured and send a note WITH YOUR ORDER indicating the number matching your color preference. 
If you do not send a note with your order you will receive the color displayed on the cover picture (the first picture).
You will receive a set of 10 Custom Made To Order Sassy Press On Nails, a file, a buffer block, an alcohol wipe, a storage box and detailed instructions on how to apply your sassy nails. GLUE IS NOT INCLUDED AND MUST BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY. Check out the professional strength glue that we have listed here in our store.
To determine your size please follow these simple directions: *** please measure by centimeters *** An example of this process is also listed in the picture section of each listing.
Take a flexible measuring tape and wrap it around the widest part of your nail....please be sure not to wrap it too tightly.
Measure from where the skin meets on your nail from the left to the right (sidewalls)
Be sure to measure all ten fingers because sometimes one hand may be larger than the other. If you are in between sizes its best to go with the larger size because you can always file down the sides for a better fit.
If you don't have a measuring tape available please place a piece of Scotch tape around the widest part of your nails and use a pen to mark your side walls. Remove the tape and lay it on a flat surface to measure with a ruler.

            Studies have shown that our sense of smell has a direct link to the cerebral cortex and limbic system which means incorporating essential oils into our lives can help enhance cognitive performance, memory, focus, and creativity ... Smells have also been linked to our ability to connect, feel, experience intuition, inspire and motivate ♥♥♥
These aromatherapy necklaces will allow you to wear your favourite essential oil wherever you go while also experiencing the positive health benefits they provide ♥ Each locket contains a tiny piece of felt which holds a few drops of oil that slowly diffuses through the ventilation holes on the front. The scent of your oil can last for several days, but you can always add more oil to the felt after the oil has completely diffused.
These lockets are great to wear during mediation to add calm energy ♥
Lockets measure approx. 1"" (30mm) in diameter and 0.2"" (5mm) in thickness and are made of surgical grade stainless steel to ensure the oils do not tarnish or breakdown the metal over time. The back of the locket is solid while the front contains a laser cut design (choose design as numbered in the first listing photo).
Lockets can be opened via a tiny slit on the right which is held together with a strong magnetic closure.
~YOUR ORDER WILL INCLUDE~:
♥ One diffuser locket necklace which includes a 24"" stainless steel cable link chain - Choose you preferred locket design from the drop down menu on the right (main photo includes numbers for each design).
♥ One piece of felt (oil not included)- choose colour from the menu before adding to cart
♥ OPTIONAL: A 1ml cork glass vial (approx. 20 drops) of one of the following 100% pure essential oil blends (choose from menu before you add to cart):

17145,Stay sexy don't get murdered my favorite murder ring stamped jewelry stacking ring signet ring,"
            Inspired by the My Favorite Murder podcast, a portion of the proceeds from this hand-stamped ring will be donated to End the Backlog, which works to eliminate the backlog of hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits. You can read more about End the Backlog here: http://www.endthebacklog.org.
Please choose sterling silver or brass. Don't see your ring size in the drop down menu? Send me a message and I can accommodate most ring sizes.
Not sure about your ring size? Stop into any jeweler or use http://findmyringsize.com/. Just remember to round up if you plan to wear a big stack. The more rings you wear on a finger, the tighter they'll feel.
Since each piece of Silversheep Jewelry is handmade to order, variations may exist in texture and finish. Please allow up to 10 days for order fulfillment prior to shipping, although it will usually be much quicker. Message me for an estimate on current shipping lead times.
About the materials used:
Silversheep jewelry is created using sterling silver, 14K yellow and rose gold fill, and genuine gemstones. It is free of nickel, lead, and cadmium and is comfortable to wear for those with a sensitivity to base metal.
Gold fill consists of a brass base coated with a layer of 14k yellow or rose gold hundreds of times thicker than plate, and with proper care will retain its finish for many years to come. It is also hypoallergenic and safe for those with metal sensitivities. As with any gold filled jewelry, the ends where the wire was cut will expose the brass core, potentially causing it to oxidize a bit over time, but it is easily buffed back up to a bright gold color. Yellow gold fill typically has a very warm golden hue, especially when heated. Please keep this in mind when making your purchase. I use 14K gold solder to solder both yellow and rose gold filled jewelry. It is strong and does not tarnish, like “yellow silver” solder. Unfortunately, the rose gold solder currently available is extremely toxic to work with, so I use yellow gold instead, resulting in slightly more visible solder seams. If this is a problem for you, I encourage you to choose one of my other color options, as a safe work environment is more important than perfectly color-matched solder!
Taking care of your jewelry:
For bright sterling silver and gold filled pieces, buff with a soft polishing cloth (nothing abrasive!). 
For oxidized and ombre pieces, please do not polish! I seal these pieces with a microcrystalline polishing wax to help preserve the finish, but there is no permanent way to seal the patina and with regular wear, the finish will continue to evolve. Avoiding contact with water, soap, and lotions will help, as will storing your pieces in a zip lock bag. Again, it's totally normal for the oxidation to lighten over time and with wear. Just think of it as your jewelry customizing specifically to you!
With these few simple steps, your Silversheep Jewelry will stay in great shape for years to come! 
Ring sizing:
Please be very careful when entering your ring size. The most accurate way to measure your ring size is to stop into any jeweler and have them measure your finger. If you're ordering a thick stack, err on the side of too large. The jeweler can also measure your finger for a ""wide band"". It may read up to a full size larger than your narrow band ring size. 
Please read my shop policies thoroughly before placing your order.

17777,Rainbow moonstone earrings - ear threaders - threader earrings - silver chain earrings - rainbow moonstone jewelry - silver ear threads,"
            Your ears are naked without these sterling silver threader earrings with rainbow moonstone drops!  
These gorgeous chain earrings are crafted of .925 sterling silver. 
Delicate soldered sterling silver chain holds a single 6x8mm rainbow moonstone briolette on each threader earring. 
- Rainbow moonstone is a one of a kind wonder of natural beauty! 
- Each with its own brilliance and rainbow flash, none of them exactly alike. 
- Rest assured even though these are all one of a kind stones, I will never send out a pair that has no rainbow flash to them. They will all have their own gorgeous amount of colorful flashiness. 
A magical pair of ear threads perfect for gifting!
(***2.5 length threaders shown on the model)
Choose from 2 lengths:
- 2.5 inch length 
- 3.5 inch length
(These lengths are the approximate measurement of each threader earring Including the bar and gemstone)
I also have threader earrings with Turquoise, Rose quartz, garnet, chalcedony and more :
https://www.etsy.com/shop/WanderlustHeartShop?ref=hdr_shop_menu&section_id=17372974
Directions:
Simply hold the silver bar and slowly pull though your ear as if you’re inserting a stud earring. 
Adjust to your personal preference. I love to wear my own pair of sterling chain ear threaders with the moonstone up high and the chain longer on the back of my ear. I also use a dab of Neosporin ointment on my ears. It makes pulling the chain through very easy with less resistance. 
***Threader earrings are not recommended for those with “stretched out” ear holes from heavy earring use,  the chain is very small (2mm in thickness) and the earrings may not stay in place.  
Shipping Information:

GOLD-FILLED (hypoallergenic)
14K Gold fill is a pressure bonded layer of gold that has 100 times more gold than plated jewelry. It is durable, won't chip or flake, is tarnish resistant, and a great alternative to ""karat"" gold that is reasonably priced, looks gorgeous and if taken care of should last for many years.
925 STERLING SILVER
Sterling Silver by definition is .925 silver and is a great silver option for those who don't wear gold. Sterling silver will oxidize and need polishing every now and then, but with the proper care and cleaning can be brought back to a shine.

What is a VCH Base Adaptor? If you don't have a VCH base adaptor yet, you can include select one with your VCH jewelry purchase when placing in cart.
Do you have a VCH piercing and would like to add and change jewelry charms? It's quite bothersome to unscrew and screw ball ends every time you want to make a change. Under The Hoode pierced bar base adaptors are designed and contoured around the ball end of the piercing bar, remaining on the bar to provide a place to easily attach/detach/change jewelry charms quickly and without the inconvenience of removing the ball ends.
Base adaptors available for nipple and VCH piercing bars at Under The Hoode.
A VCH base adaptor is a silvertone stainless steel element that feeds onto a VCH piercing bar or ring which allows for attaching and removing charms and jewelry cascades. Easy to use. Simply feed base adaptor onto piercing bar or ring and leave in place. Attach and remove jewelry cascades and charms to and from the available attachment ring.
** Piercing bar not included **.

Handmade ❤ Texas. 
✦ When you purchase a piece from Hartsock Designs Jewelry, you rest assured knowing that you’re getting quality hand-crafted jewelry that’s made by an artist who really cares and loves what she is doing. While all jewelry is fragile, I am diligent with my craftsmanship. I  love my customers and will make sure you’re well taken care of.
✦✦All my pieces are carefully handmade using the highest quality sterling & fine silver or gold filled components; NEVER plated! Gold filled jewelry is more valuable and considered heirloom quality and will not tarnish or lose its gold layer, whereas gold plated jewelry will tarnish after extended wear. Gold filled jewelry is a beautiful, affordable alternative to solid gold, and can usually be worn by people with sensitive skin. 
Unlike mass produced jewelry, slight variations or imperfections are to be expected on hand made jewelry, adding to the charm, character and uniqueness of the piece. These irregularities and imperfection are signs of authenticity.
« With your purchase you are agreeing to the shop policies - please read through them. Thank you! »

19090,Bat Tie Clip,"
            One of our most popular tie clips, the Bat Tie Clips have a striking bat design that is set off by a carbon fiber-look decal. These tie clips are a fun way to add some extra style – and keep your tie from flopping around, blowing in the breeze or falling into your food!
I know a lot of people have bought these Bat Tie Clips for use as gifts for guys. If you’re looking for gift ideas for young men, gifts for teen boys, grad gifts for guys, or gift ideas for your boyfriend or husband, you should consider these (or one of my other designs, if he’s not the “bat” type of guy).
I have these Bat Tie Clips laser cut from from .08” thick 5052 aluminum, and then I hand bend and polish them and send them to you packaging in a nice black satin drawstring pouch. While these tie clips are made to snugly fit a medium thickness tie and shirt, they are slightly adjustable by hand bending them more or less to fit a particular tie. 
Each “standard” Bat Tie Clip is 2.25” wide, made to fit a standard 3-3.5” wide tie. I also have a skinny tie version available at 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/124543491/bat-skinny-tie-clip.
 In fact, I offer a big range of standard size and skinny tie clips, from “cool” to ""sports-themed"" to “conservative.” See them all at 
http://www.etsy.com/shop/KevinCossDesigns
 .
*** PLEASE READ
Buyer is responsible for any applicable customs fees if shipping out of the US. Also, the standard price international shipping does take a long time, sometimes as long as a month. I recommend upgrading to priority mail at checkout if you need your tie clip sooner!        ",25.00,4.8852,"Handmade item

19294,Kids Green fuzzy furry Feet- Kids request your SIZE,"
            These are my awesome ""Green fuzzy furry Feet"" Slipper Socks in  Green. I hand knit these w/ 100% wool in this fabulous shade of  Green . These slippers were felted making the fibers crush together for a lush thick solid feel. All the added fringes are random & seriously fun! If you are a Grinchy Fan  then these are a must! They look furry & fringy. Each foot is uniquely different making no pair I make EVER a duplicate! I never use a pattern these are totally free form from my brain to my hand to your feet. I hope you enjoy my Green fuzzy furryFeet Creations and snatch up a pair for your uniquely special self! 
This listing is for 1 PAIR.... let me know if you need a Family Pack and I'll work a special price for you!  
THIS LISTING IS FOR A KIDS  message me the size you need.
 Measure your feet to ensure a perfect fit. They will stretch and an exact size is kind of impossible due to the nature of the felting process, that being said the wool comfortably conforms to the foot and is super cushion-y making these my shoe of choice in the home from September - March. Convo me for colors or sizes you are interested and I will do a custom listing for you. These are terrific for little ones to grown ups...In fact my 30ish brother always has to have a pair for Christmas, (usually in Steelers black n gold) Yep men wear them too! NO ONE will ever have a pair like these, and NO ONE will wear them without someone noticing!
***As with all wool products only spot wash, or cold water wash and lay flat to dry.

19321,MAILE Seamless Bikini Bottom,"
            Seamless, comfortable, and NO elastic to dig into your sides! This new simple style slips on easy and hugs your curves in the most flattering of ways.
  The raw edge quality of this style and minimal cut does nothing but embrace the female figure.
  These bottoms have a dual purpose: show them off at the beach or slip them under tight/fitted clothing to take advantage of their seamless quality.
  Because these bottoms are made without elastic and one thin layer of fabric, they are incredibly comfortable, but be advised they aren't for rough waters or light colored/see through fabrics.
  Each piece has a unique liner in the crotch area for comfort and just enough discretion.
  Model is a size 3 in shorts and wearing a size XS in our Driftwood print

19480,Pair of vintage French 1930's / 1940's handmade childs leather boots with wooden soles - bottes sabots ancien - Ideal as a film prop,"
            These traditionally handmade childs boots are made from brown leather with wooden soles. They date from around the 1930's to 1940's. 
In very good condition for their age. The leather is very stiff, and the boots are very narrow, making them next to impossible to wear. They would however, be great to display in a shoe shop window, or as a film prop.
I can not tell what size they are, but they measure approx 7 1/8 inches (18.1 cm) long, and 5 1/2 inches (14 cm) high.
They weigh 406g without packing.

            * Ready to ship in 5-7 business days. Fully lined with organic bamboo velour. Perfect for warm or cold weather.
Which sole material should you choose?
Fabric Sole: Meant for babies not crawling, walking, or standing because the soles are slippery.
Rubber Sole: Meant for walking and standing babies. Non slip and water and heat resistant. 
Rubber Sole/Toe/Heel: Meant especially for crawling, standing, and walking babies. Crafted for durability and longevity.

If you cannot measure because of gift giving purposes then choose by age or shoe size. Please know that sizing is most accurate based off measurement. DO NOT ORDER UP A SIZE. Our shoes are made to have wiggle room within the size range you choose.
How to Measure Baby's Foot:
With a tape measure (not a ruler!) and with baby lying on the ground, please measure your baby’s foot from the very bottom of the heel to the very tip of the longest toe and then choose the size that your baby’s foot length falls under:

3-6 mos: 3.75""-4.06""- shoe size 2

20429,"Tooled Leather Belt - Custom Leather Belt - Personalized Leather Belt - Brown 1-1/2"" SND Pattern","
            This is a 1-1/2"" handcrafted leather belt with a lovely scrolled pattern.  All of my belts are custom made using 8 oz. double shoulder leather and are hand tooled by me and NEVER embossed.  This custom leather belt is block-dyed a medium brown and ready to be sized up to a size 44"".  Just note the size when ordering (please see IMPORTANT NOTE below before ordering).
It comes with a brass plated buckle which is held securely in place by two snaps.  The use of snaps allows you to easily swap out the buckle with a designer/western style buckle or other buckle of your choice.
I can personalize your custom leather belt with a name at no additional charge.  Just note the name when ordering.  I use 3/4"" letters as seen in the slide above. 
To see other belt patterns available, click here   
www.etsy.com/shop/HawkinsLeather?section_id=13127688
IMPORTANT NOTE:  IT IS THE BUYER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO ORDER THE CORRECT BELT SIZE.  Order your custom leather belt 2"" LARGER than your pant size (i.e., 36"" pant size = 38"" belt).  Or, better yet, measure around your waist or hips, wherever you will wear the belt, and ADD 2"" to that measurement.  If you will be wearing a designer/western style buckle with this belt DO NOT add the 2"", as the designer/western style buckle adds 2"" to the length of the belt.  I punch 5 holes in all of my custom leather belts.  The center hole will be at the measurement you order, with two holes on either side.  Because the belts are custom made to fit you individually, if the belt does not fit, I cannot issue a refund or remake the belt.  If you are not sure or have questions, PLEASE ask before ordering, I am more than happy to assist you in ordering the correct size.        ",25.00,4.9106,"Handmade item
