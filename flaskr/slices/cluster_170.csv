            Beautiful antique trunk!  Has a lot of patina, but this is one of the few that I have found that actually still has the shelf and shelving paper intact.  As you can see from the photo it comes with the original floral print shelving paper.  It's really cute!  This could be used for so many things, a display for a retail business, to hold guest bath towels in a farmhouse or rustic décor setting.  This would also make for a great movie, prop or photo prop!  There are so many things you could do with this!   
Shipping cost may vary depending on your location, because of the size of this item it may be cheaper to ship via Greyhound, please call or email for an exact amount prior to placing your order.   To ship this item via Greyhound from Florida to San Francisco would cost approximately 75 an New York 50.

2766,Information Only * * * Antique Spinning Wheels - Repairs Still Needed,"
            * Information and Reservation Only *
If you are interested in a wheel, you may ""order"" the ad and reserve a wheel. No wheels are being sold for fifty cents.
* Information and Reservation Only *
I “specialize” in finding and refurbishing inexpensive wheels for spinners that can’t afford a big-ticket item. I'm refurbishing a few spinning wheels; please PM me to find out the state of repairs.
* Information and Reservation Only *
Here's what I have in stock and ready to be repaired. Some will require more work than others, and some may never run. Please contact me if you're interested in one, and I'll start working on it right away. Then I'll make a custom invoice to send to you.
* Information and Reservation Only *
Photos and handwritten assessments of the working wheels below can be found here: https://sites.google.com/view/bobnweave
* Blaine (250)
* Edina (vintage oak saxony, very heavy) (200)
* Hastings (an Alfred Andresen Saxony) (350)
* Lakeville (175)
* Northtown (a Frank Fell wheel) (230)
* Washington  (175)
------------Potential Parts Wheels (or wheels that will need more work) ------------------------------
Belleplaine (missing flyer assembly)
Cologne (bad drive wheel)
Columbia-Heights (good for parts; has woodworm holes in drive wheel which doesn't match the rest of the wheel)
Darkslanty (needs a maiden and flyer assembly)
Ebay (needs new leathers)
Forestlake (needs major work)
Goodwill (using for parts)
Greenmeanie (needs major work)
Hopkins (tender drive wheel and no MOA)
Lightslanty (no maidens/flyer)
Minneapolis (missing major pieces; may never work)
Minneapolisfell (bad drive wheel; no maidens/flyer)
Stockholmfell (needs Ashford flyer etc)
Stockholm-F (interesting puzzle; needs major work)
Stockholm-H (bad drive wheel)
Stpaul (bad drive wheel)
Turkish (missing major pieces; may never work)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I obtain a new wheel, I'll start their spa treatment... a good wipe down and a slathering of ""spoon oil"". ""Spoon oil"" is a 1:4 mixture of beeswax to food-safe mineral oil. Most of these wheels are really dry, and they're quite literally, ""drinking"" in the oil.
As far as the repairs go, some just needs new leathers others need a flyer/bobbin/whorl assembly. It's rare to find wheels with nearly flawless flyers and/or a chip or two out of the bobbins and/or whorls, but they do cross my path occasionally.
I include the 60 fee for shipping via Greyhound Package Express (UPS is charging 100 or more).
If you set up a ""wheel railroad"" (where people drive wheels to and from each other), I can refund the shipping cost. Two of my favorite ravelry groups are here:

15035,"Wool Combs, Extra Fine Valkyrie Viking","
            Back in stock!
Wool combs designed specifically for finer, shorter fibers.  
The 43 polished, hardened steel tines are 3/32"" diameter, 4 1/4"" long, and set 3/16"" on center, mounted in an all-maple handle.  Tines have a long taper to a sharp point. 
These tines never need ""straightening.""  They are flexible enough to take abuse, and still bounce back to their intended alignment.  
The tines slant slightly back for the last 1"" to the tip which helps them pass by each other without interference.  
The combing head is 5"" wide with a 4"" working width.  Handle is a comfortable one inch diameter. Made of silky-smooth unfinished hardwood maple.
Total weight for the pair is approximately 18 1/2 ounces.
This listing is for a set of wool combs just like the one in the photo, though the woodburn is changing, as Valkyrie updates their stamp.
We also offer a comb pad, that allows one comb to be clamped to the table.
