There are other wooden discs with the game in brighter red, yellow white and purple colors (perhaps later editions to game). The box measures 11"" x 8"".

6255,Stained elevated feeder/ dog bowl stand with 3 bowls,"
            Reclaimed wood elevated pet feeder with removable dishwasher safe, stainless steel bowls included. All stands are sealed with polyurethane for protection and a smooth finish, unless otherwise requested. 
Each feeder can be kept clean with mild soap, water, & a soft sponge or cloth.
The dimensions of the 3-bowl stands are approximately 29.25"" long x 10.75"" wide x the height you select to purchase.
We offer our stands in the following standard heights:
6 inches tall
8 inches tall
10 inches tall
12 inches tall
14 inches tall
Stands can be made for taller or shorter upon request. Please message us to determine if we can create a feeder stand for your needs and we will create a separate listing for it as applicable.
BOWL SIZE:
Stainless steel 2 quart bowls are included with feeder (holds approximately 7 cups)
Note: The 2 quart size bowls may be larger than desired if you have a very small dog (e.g. shih tzu, chihuahua, etc.). Please contact us if you'd like a custom size feeder built to fit smaller bowls.
HOW TO SELECT YOUR STAIN COLOR &  PERSONALIZATION:
Please select the color you'd like us to stain it from the Stain Color drop-down menu. 
FREE personalization UPON REQUEST: If you'd like any text on the stand (e.g. your pet's name), please request this in the notes to seller at checkout.  ***If no personalization is requested in the notes to seller at checkout, we will assume the buyer does not want any text on the stand.***  
We can include the personalized text in any font available on a PC, so if you have a preference please specify (e.g. you can be specific like ""Arial"" or ""Impact"" font, or just note ""cursive"" or ""print"" and we'll select one that looks good for you). The lettering is vinyl. We then coat over the vinyl with polyurethane to make sure the lettering sticks on the stand and remains over time.
HOW TO DETERMINE WHICH HEIGHT STAND TO ORDER FOR YOUR PET:
- Please measure the number of inches from your pet's shoulders to the ground. 
- The bowl stand should be just below chin level so he/she can comfortably eat from the bowl without reaching upwards or drastically bending over. 
- We receive many messages requesting what size bowl stand is typical for X breed of dog. While we are happy to provide this information based on what we've seen our customers order, each individual animal is different even if he/she is the same breed as another, so this info is merely meant to serve as guidance and we still suggest measuring your pet to determine the right fit for him/her individually. As an example, we have 3 pitbulls ourselves and 2 of them eat from 12"" tall stands but 1 of them requires a 10"" stand because she is shorter than the others.
PRODUCTION TIME & SHIPPING:
It typically takes approximately 10-12 business days from date of purchase for us to build your order and ship it out. If you need your bowl stand in a faster time frame, please send us a message before placing your order so we can advise if we have the ability to meet your requested timing and whether a rush fee would apply. 
RALEIGH NC LOCAL PICK UP:
We can arrange for local delivery or pick up if you are in the Raleigh, NC area. There is no charge to pick up, so please use LOCALDELIV as your promo code for shipping costs to be removed from your total at checkout. Please message us so we can make arrangements. Local delivery may result in a small fee, so please message us before using this code if you would like your item delivered or us to meet you somewhere locally.

We also offer the stands with only 1 bowl or 2 bowls instead of 3. Please visit our shop to view the listings for these other variations.        ",53.95,4.9451,"Handmade item

            The ORIGINAL TeddyGrams adjustable Tot Tower. Your child's safety is worth every penny spent on this Tot Tower. Our Child's Kitchen Helper Step Stool stands 32"" tall, 15 1/2 inches wide and the base is 17 1/2 "" deep. This is perfect for your toddler as they shadow you in their curiosity to learn - in the kitchen, at the bathroom sink, dad's workbench or anywhere to get your child to counter height safely. It weighs in at only 14 pounds and is easy for your toddler to move. 
There are three height adjustments so as your child grows taller, the standing board can be lowered to keep your child at a safe height inside the tower thus allowing many years of use.  The standing platform is securely attached to the dowel rods by two screws. The Tot Tower is made from 1"" pine, sanded and ready for the customer to stain, paint or just use as is. It is sold unfinished as shown in the photos. It is strong enough to safely hold over 200 pounds. Six self adhesive felt pads are included for scratch-free floors. The felt is not installed so as not to interfere if you choose to paint or stain the Tower.  
Feel free to call, text or email for more information.

            Printable EXPENSE TRACKER for your Personal and A5 planner!
Two inserts for the price of one!
Hi! A great Expense Tracker that perfectly fit:
- Personal size planners (Paper size 6.7"" x 3.7"" / 171 x 95 mm) 
- A5 planners (Paper size 8.27"" x 5.83"" / 210 x 148 mm)
- Letter size (Paper size 11"" x 8.5"" / 215 ,9 x 279,4 mm)
All of the items in my shop are digital products and available as an instant download (NO physical printed products will be delivered).
Simply print them out on A4 International paper, cut off the tabs and print the file as many times as you like for personal use.
You will receive 2 high resolution .pdf document as shown in the photos ( front and back is the same file for A5 insert).
Printing tips:
- Make sure to leave the size of the paper at 100% and don't tell your printer to scale to fit to the page. This will ensure your brand new dividers will perfectly fit your planner.
- Use heavy card stock for the best results, either when printing or for gluing the planner dividers on afterwards.
Please note:
Even though all the products in my shop are made with a high standard color profile and a high 300 DPI resolution perfect for printing, colors can always slightly differ between monitors and printers.

NOTE: The term ""natural"" indicates nuanced shades. The color tone of unbleached linen fabric depends on the growing conditions of the linen plant. This means that the natural linen color allows for small differences in tone and confirms the fact that the fabric is not chemically treated. The actual colors are shown and described on a separate picture, but the monitor display color may differ slightly from the real.

Material: 100% all-natural, eco-friendly jute burlap. We use a special, high-quality burlap for all of our prints. Unlike most burlap, this is a tightly woven, heavyweight burlap with a high thread count. The superior quality of this product results in a sharper, cleaner image and allows for fine detail in your print!
Backing: A proprietary, heavy-duty backing is included with every print. This conveys a sturdy, photo-like quality to the fabric and helps to maintain the shape, prevent fraying, and prolong the life of your personalized print.
Sizes: Available sizes indicate the dimensions of the actual print itself (Ex. If you select 8x10, the fabric will measure 8 inches by 10 inches)
