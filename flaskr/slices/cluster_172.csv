4081,"Powder Box, Houbigant Chantilly Dusting Powder, Vintage Toiletry, Pink Plastic Pot, Dressing Table Accessory, New Old Stock - 1960s / 1970s","
            A large Powder Box made by Houbigant in the 1960s / 1970s, in excellent condition.
This plastic powder pot features a plain pink lid with a simple framed gold ‘H’ on a white background. The design shows slight wear, mainly to the gold tone ‘H’ but this doesn’t detract from the overall design and contrasts the candy pink colour perfectly. 
A large gold rim sits under the lid, this shows slight surface scratches as to be expected of preloved items, but again this is minimal. The base of the piece shows a textured pattern to the pink plastic, at the centre of the base a smooth circle is embossed with the words ‘PARIS’, HOUBIGANT’,’NEW YORK’, ‘CHANTILLY’, ‘DUSTING POWDER’, ‘NET WT 3 OZ’. The letters ‘ADE’ are also stamped in purple ink on the raised design.
Once the lid is removed the aroma of the ‘CHANTILLY’ dusting powder fills the air, a pink powder puff and sealed powder section can also be seen. The satin section at the top of this large powder puff is marked ‘HOUBIGANT’ in gold lettering. The pink card stamped ‘CHANTILLY HOUBIGANT’ hides the unused powder. The inside of the pot is in excellent condition and shows no signs of use.
The perfect dressing table accessory!!

HOW TO USE BEARD CONDITIONER
Massage a few drops into a dry beard to keep it growing thick, soft and clean. Moisturizes dry skin and softens rough hair. Applying to a dry beard maximizes absorption and softening power of this leave-in conditioning oil. Perfect for any form of facial hair from stubbly beard beginnings to knee-length face beast. Start with just 3-4 drops of Beard Conditioner and increase depending on beard length and skin type. For best results, wash and thoroughly dry the beard using Wild Man Beard Wash as needed, several times a week:
www.etsy.com/listing/114765876/wild-man-beard-wash-the-original-60ml
If you have very dry or flaky skin beneath the beard, be sure to massage down to the roots. Extremely dry beards will benefit from using our Beard Cream:

We do not recommend rubber bulb/dropper bottles for long term use with oil-based products. Eventually the rubber will begin to expand and break down. These droppers will hold up for several months of use with this trial size set. To lengthen the life of your dropper bottles, always store them upright when not in use.

FEEDBACK FOR WILD MAN:
""The smell is great, not too heavy. The products apply easily and the conditioner (oil) does not come out fast, so it does not get wasted. But more importantly of all, my husbands beard has never been softer! He has a very curly and course beard and now it is just as smooth as the hair on the top of his head! We have tried many different products but none have done what this set has. It keeps the skin underneath clean but not dry, it softens the hair, and it smells wonderful. .'""
""as an ambassador for the manly man, I have to say this is a fantastic product, within seconds and i am not kidding my beard became softer and took on a beautiful lustre. The perfume of the essential oils blended wonderfully with my bay rum and i really cannot recommend this product more. Oh my girlfriend liked the feel and smell too!!! fantastic.""
""Never have I had such a luxurious beard, women now swoon at my feet and men grow shameful of their ragged tufts of chin fuzz. I know now what my life could be...what my beard could be. Anyone sitting on the fence about this product should stop sitting there with a sub-par beard and embrace the wild man. ""
""I bought it for my boyfriend, he loves it, and I do too!! The scent is perfectly measured, I thought it would be way more powerful, but as I said it is just perfect! It also makes the beard really soft, and thanks to this product, there is no more conflict between my sensitive skin and his beard! ""

***Peridot is an extraordinary crystal for healing the emotional body and resolving matters of the heart. It cleanses and heals hurt feelings and “bruised egos,” lessening anger, jealousy, resentment and spite, while teaching one to understand that holding onto people, or the past, is counterproductive to one’s growth. It teaches one to examine the past for the gift of the experiences, admit mistakes and let go of guilt and blame, forgiving oneself, or others, in order to move forward.***        ",46.43,4.8923,"Handmade item

I cannot be held responsible for customs delays so I would advise you to pay for tracked shipping.
If purchasing as a gift, please contact me first before purchasing so I am aware I need to meet a deadline. I cannot be held responsible for missed deadlines. If I'm unable to meet your deadline I will let you know. 
Please also be advised that I'm making some improvements to my lifestyle and the way I run the business. Last year I was on call 7 days a week and this wasn't good for my health and wellbeing. Please respect my personal time over the weekend and during the evenings after 5.30pm. I will not be responding to messages until I'm back in the workshop. I assure you I will respond within a day or so (except for weekends.) Thank you in advance.
Shipping to the UK is fully tracked with every purchase. I have now raised the price for international shipping as more and more customers have been asking for tracking numbers after shipment when the £6 standard shipping has been purchased. £10 is extremely pricey but this is the cost to ship a t-shirt tracked and signed to international destinations. Paying that little extra gives you peace of mind. Unfortunately Canadian customers will only receive a tracking number which shows the parcel in transit and parcel delivered. Canada doesn't currently offer a fully tracked service from the UK. If you want to pay for an untracked service at £6 please contact me before making a purchase. 
DUE TO THE UNIQUE APPLICATION OF FABRIC, EACH HOODIE POUCH WILL DIFFER FROM THE IMAGE SHOWN. EVERY LAPTOP LCD HAS A VARIED COLOUR AND RESOLUTION SETTING SO COLOUR MAY SLIGHTLY DIFFER.
Product info: Hand sewn and altered in my studio. Remember, these aren't machine produced so they aren't perfect but I do aim to perfect stitching. Printed logo to the chest. 100% cotton. Draw string hood. This item is brand new with tags. Comfortable kangaroo pouch pocket.

Please measure up before placing an order as our exchange procedure is lengthy and you will be required to return you item before a new product is made and shipped.) You will also be required to pay for return shipping and the cost of shipment for the new product being shipped out again.
