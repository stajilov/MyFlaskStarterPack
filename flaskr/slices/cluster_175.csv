6770,"Creeping Thyme ground cover, 1000 seeds, fragrant herb, pink blooms, perennial zones 4 to 9, sun or light shade, deerproof, Thymus serpyllum","
            This miniature thyme is fragrant, pretty, and charming. It's also incredibly useful. Only 2""-3"" tall, you can walk on it (releasing its lemony aroma), tuck it between pavers in a garden path, use it as a tidy border or fill in a flower bed. It grows quickly but isn't pushy, delivers texture, fragrance, and flowers, is great for cooking, and requires almost no care.
A hardy perennial in zones 4-9, Creeping Thyme has a place in almost every garden. It cascades nicely in a rockery, fills in cracks, spills out of planters. In summer, it's covered with tiny purple blooms that attract honeybees and butterflies. It can be planted as a lawn that never needs mowing.
Creeping Thyme thrives in full sun or light shade, well-draining soil, with occasional water. It blooms in late spring through early summer. The pink-purple blooms are so dense that they completely cover the foliage.  The rest of the year it's dense green. This is the most charming, versatile, and least demanding ground cover ever.
Surface sow the tiny seeds in a flat, keep them warm and moist, then tear off chunks of seedlings and plant them 6"" apart.  They'll fill in over time.  This much seed will cover about 25 square feet.  Four packs will cover about 100 square feet. Sixteen packs will cover 1000 square feet, about a half a pound. 
1000 seeds

7885,100 pcs. of Freshly made incense sticks (choose five scents),"
            I am not going to tell you that my incense is the best on Etsy, least expensive on the web, or that it is second to none.
I will not tell you that my incense is doublely - triplely scented! nor will I say it will burn forever and the aroma will last longer than that.
I WILL SAY: sticks are standard 11 inches long. you will receive 100 pieces, broken down into 20 sticks per bag. I urge you to choose your five scents and list them in the comment/special instructions space provided when ordering. If you CAN NOT decide, simply type ""SURPRISE ME"" and that is what I will do. I will send five scents that I choose at random. 
Now, here are the fragrances I offer:
AMBER (white) -  A very elegant fragrance, addictive. A delicate and distinct musky scent of fresh amber. A surrounding aroma overall.
APPLE CIDER - The coziness of simmering cider is a seasonal classic.  A delightful blend of spices, sweet caramelized apples, cinnamon sticks, and the peel for a kick. 
ASIAN DREAM - Dream away to a mystical fantasy, an alluring forbidden forest.
ASPEN PINE -  Imagine yourself in a dense pine forest upon a snow covered mountain top.
 
AUTUMN SUNRISE - Deep earthy and cool, with hints of musk and spice. 
BLACKBERRY SAGE -  Freshly picked blackberries tempered with cool, crisp sage. A unique  and refreshing herbal balance 
 
BLACK COCONUT - Delicious! Vanilla, Tonka Bean, and a hint of White Florals bathed in coconut milk
BLACK MUSK - Deep, musky, dark, heavy, sensual in a mysterious way. 
BLUE GARDENIAS - A fresh, pretty, exotic floral arrangement.  
BUTT NAKED - Fresh green apples perfectly harmonized with refreshing melons and juicy pears.
CEDARWOOD - Cool, clean, and woodsy.
CHINA RAIN - Soft, subtle hints of lily of the valley, jasmine, hyacinth, rose, and ylang ylang.
CHESTNUT BROWN SUGAR - Toasted chestnuts drenched in a buttery brown sugar syrup. 
CINNAMON - A nip in the butt sort of sweet spice .... GOTCHA!
CITRONELLA - Crisp and refreshing without being overpowering. The clean and fresh lemony fragrance of citronella grass. BUGS B. GONE!
CITRUS BERRY - Tart, sweet, crisp, ....... a fruit basket free for all!

8280,Natural Deodorant - Scented Deodorant - Lavender Scent Deodorant - Homemade Deodorant - Preservative Free Deodorant - Aluminum Free,"
            My Pit Butter is a safe, natural, and chemical free alternative to traditional deodorants and I am simply in love with the name and the product!  Playfully tongue in cheek, this natural deodorant features an expertly blended combination of only natural oils, butters, and ingredients to offer your pits the ultimate in pampering.  
Each purchase of this listing includes a 1 ounce deodorant push up container of Lavender Scent! 
This natural deodorants power comes from the magic of baking soda, beeswax, olive oil, coconut oil, and cornstarch and in the case of our scented offerings, essential oils!  This natural deodorant is chemical free, preservative free, paraben free and even aluminum free!  Your homemade deodorant does a wonderful job of masking odors, but it is not an antiperspirant.  Unlike traditional box store offerings, this natural deodorant has a consistency like putty which means you can use the tip of your finger or a Popsicle stick to scoop up small amounts to massage into your armpits.  This allows you to save money and product by limiting extraneous use! 
With over ten different scents to choose from, including Lavender Deodorant, Orange Deodorant, and even Lemongrass Deodorant, you will be able to find a different My Pit Butter for every mood! 
  
As with any natural body product, please test a small sample on your skin to ensure you do not have any allergies.  Some people experience mild stinging with initial use due to a pH unbalance.  If this occurs discontinue daily use and limit to every other day.  If you purchase the Vanilla Deodorant it may turn slightly tan colored as I do not use artificial stabilizers.  
**NOTE** If PREGNANT or NURSING, choose my ""Unscented"" Pit Butter. 
Additionally, I recommend keeping this in a cool dry place as it may melt at higher temperatures.  
If you would like to continue shopping for more natural deodorants, healthy body products, and only the best skin care, you can return to the MiracleBodyButter shop home by clicking the following link:

8880,"Smellgood Solid Cologne - Beeswax, Jojoba Oil, and Fragrance Oils in a Portable Sliding Tin - Made by Hand with Natural Beeswax at Our Farm","
            Our Smellgood solid cologne line doesn't spare the smellgood and comes in a handy slider tin that's easy to take wherever you go.
Solid cologne is simple to use: just rub it with your finger then apply to neck or wrist.
The natural Tennessee beeswax and jojoba oil we use in every tin helps lock in the fragrance oils and essential oils, making it easy to transfer to skin and apply as needed throughout the day.
We make every tin of Smellgood by hand right here on our Tennessee farm, with many of our scents working in traditional Southern smells like gun oil, cedar, and bourbon along with more exotic scents such as ginger, vetiver, and balsam of Peru.
Each 0.25 ounce tin of Smellgood contains just beexwax, jojoba oil, and fragrance oils.
Below are the different unique fragrances we offer in our Smellgood solid cologne line:
12 Point Buck -- anise star oil and cedarwood oil not give this one a special kick but old-school hunters swear insist that using anise star oil can block all traces of human scent.
Bourbon & Smoke -- campfires, whiskey, and just a touch of sandalwood scent.
Cold Morning, Warm Stove -- if the smell of a wood-burning stove on a crisp, cold morning gets you going, this one is for you.
Dark & Stormy -- this blend of vetiver, ginger, and patchouli is hard to pin down but very potent.
Dog Died, Woman Left -- our high, lonesome scent for when you're feeling blue, scented by George Jones' tears.
Gone Courtin' -- sandalwood and cedarwood will put a little pep in your step and lipstick on your collar.
Gun Oil & Cedar -- the name of this one pretty much says all that needs saying.
Sunday Best -- peppermint oil and lavender give this one an old-time, righteous boost.
Up Jumped the Devil -- a bedeviling mix of lavender, amber, myrrh, and musk offers a proposition that's hard to decline.        ",5.99,4.764,"Handmade item

8972,Sugaring Paste Natural Hair Removal for Thicker Hair - 2 Oz - Sugaring Paste - Body Sugaring - Traditional Sugaring - Organic Hair Removal,"
            Sugaring paste is an organic, natural and gentle alternative to waxing and shaving. The sugaring hair removal method has been used for centuries dating back to ancient Egypt and that beauty guru Cleopatra, Persia, and Arabia. Beginners to Sugaring and those with thicker/coarse hair should start with sugaring paste.
Sugaring can be used by anyone who wants a natural alternative for hair removal. All hair types and skin types, including those with eczema, psoriasis, even varicose veins, can use sugaring. Body sugaring works to remove hair from the body including the legs, arms, underarms, bikini, upper lip, chin, eyebrows, and toes.
Sugaring also may lead to permanent hair removal if performed in the Anagen stage of growth. With sugaring, your hair grows back softer, slower, and finer. Over time, you will have less and less hair.
♦ Dark amber in color
♦ Thick almost like taffy - It is firm but pliable
♦ No hair removal strips, only your fingers or applicator alone are needed! 
♦ Easily cleans up with warm water
Each order of this listing includes: 
• One 2.3 ounces BPA free plastic tub of Sugaring Paste
Ingredients: 
Organic Raw Sugar, Fresh squeezed Lemon Juice and Purified Mountain Spring Water
• Sugaring applicator
• 1 small pouch of Pure Cornstarch
• A 10 ml sample size of my Pure Aloe Vera
More Info: 
http://etsy.me/23EfwlU
• Detailed instruction cards
• A brief history of sugaring
• Links to my video tutorials on YOUTUBE. 
PACKAGED SHIP WEIGHT is 7.2 Ounce First Class. Shipping is based on WEIGHT. 
General Instructions: 
Apply cornstarch to clean, dry skin after a gentle exfoliation*. 
• Using the applicator, spread a layer of the sugaring paste in the OPPOSITE direction of hair growth in the desired area three times, using slight pressure. 
• On the third spread motion, remove the sugaring paste by using a Flicking motion in the SAME direction of the hair growth.
See tutorial video for a demonstration of flicking motion.
*Detailed instructions are provided. 
*It is highly recommended that you gently exfoliate your skin gently before sugaring with a non-oil based exfoliant.
If you have not sugared before, it does take a little practice. I strongly recommend watching the tutorial videos provided on my YouTube Channel or website. However, once you get the hang of it, it truly is amazing. 
Latest Sugaring Paste Review:
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐    
Veeery happy with the sugaring paste!! 😄 I have tried it once (my first time sugaring ever, so I did struggled a bit) but, it worked just as good as I hoped for! No redness or soreness after and sooooo smooth, omg! I'm pretty sure that with some more ""practice"" this won't be any problem at all. I will never spend ""tons"" of money again to do this at a salon, and would definitely order more sugaring paste from JBHomemadeShop! Worth the money ✌

            Hardcover: 128 pages
Editor: Hassan
Collection: The strange hunters Club - shipping address
Language: French
Product dimensions: 29,7 x 25.7 x 1.8 cm
Presentation Editor:
Camille Renversade, young Illustrator just out of the famous school of drawing Emile Cohl in Lyon, would love to be part of these expeditions, consisting of scientists, researchers, photographers, designers and be accompanied by guides and local porters who, until the end of the 19th century went to the discovery of new lands remote looking for animals or plants unknown. He would have liked to return, organizing conferences, exposing samples in the cabinets of curiosities of museums and publish reports as exploration books.
But today, what can we hope to discover who is not already? How to find the atmosphere of these trips to the former, how to discover wonderful treasures and to where and what guide his research?
He then turns to the only beings that still remain to be discovered, fantastic animals, and the only science that is devoted to them: cryptozoology, which the creator of the term is the Belgian zoologist Bernard Heuvelmans.
A science that attempts to investigate objectively the case of animals only known by testimonies, anatomical parts or photographs, such as the yeti, sea monsters, and other dragons.
But how to mount such an expedition? The only solution for Camille Renversade is to create an expedition to its measurement by inventing it purely and simply.
He took as his companion for this trip in imaginary eminent specialist of humans supernatural: Pierre Dubois.

11523,"Beatrix Potter Books Very Vintage, Vintage & Almost New","
            Beatrix Potter books are notoriously difficult to date. Here's what I found on the web:-
Reprints of Beatrix Potter's works usually resemble the original first editions in almost every detail, and can be hard to distinguish from them. The key points to look for are:
(a) the first editions are usually dated in the imprint at the foot of the title page, on the front (recto) of the leaf. The copyright date on the back (verso) will show the first date of publication, but this alone is not indicative of first edition status. Later printings have no date in the imprint.
(b) her publisher Frederick Warne became a limited company in 1917, after the great majority of her best-known books had been first published. Therefore, most books with ""Limited"" or ""Ltd"" in the company name, either in the imprint or on the front cover, are published in or after 1917 and are reprints.
(c) any edition bearing an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) was issued after 1967.
I have therefore separated my books into numbered categories:- 
1. Very Vintage, pre 1967 (no ISBN), 
2. Vintage (with ISBN) have pictures stuck to the front cover
3. Almost new have pictures printed onto the front cover
The prices are per book. As stock turns over the books pictured may no longer be available, please let me know if you would like photographs of the book/s you chose.
PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR COMBINED POSTAGE COSTS IF BUYING MORE THAN ONE ITEM.        ",3.98,4.9643,"Vintage item from the 1930s

14662,Amigurumi VW Beetle Volkswagen Inspired Bug Car Crochet Pattern PDF,"
            Vroooom vroooom !  Here is a soft and woolly version of the most beloved car ever ! 
This --- PDF PATTERN --- describes in US terminology how to crochet a lovely Volkswagen inspired Beetle as shown on picture. (Pattern is also available in Dutch, German and French, see below.)
Finished size will be approx. 9” (23 cm) long, 4.3” (11 cm) tall, 4.7” (12 cm) wide, crocheted using acrylic yarn (8 ply / DK), with hook size E (3.5 mm).
If you wish to make a taller or smaller version of this Beetle, you can just use thicker or thinner yarn / crochet hook. This pattern is also suitable for wool or cotton yarn.
The pattern is mostly worked in continuous rounds. Some parts are worked in rows.
Materials used :
* Crochet hook size E (3.5 mm)
* Yarn in pink (approx. 60 gr), grey, black (both approx. 25 gr.), small amounts of white, red, orange.
* Fiberfill stuffing, preferably a sturdy kind
* 2 mother of pearl buttons, diameter approx. 0.5” (1.2 cm)
* 2 pieces of chenille wire or pipe cleaner, both approx. 4.7” (12 cm)
* Stitch marker, tapestry needle, pins, optional: matching colors sewing thread
Stitches used :
chain, slip stitch, single crochet, half double crochet, increasing and decreasing, bobble stitch (instruction included), surface slip stitches, working through back of loops
Skill level : intermediate
Gauge is not important for this pattern, just crochet tight enough so your stuffing will not show through the stitches.
Pattern is my own original design, described in english, using US terminology.
