3927,Big Eyes Walter Keane & Margaret Keane Painting side-by-side 1965,"
            Offered, a Very Rare  Photograph of Walter Keane & Margaret Keane Painting side-by-side 1965.
This is a handsome reproduction from the original measures 5x7"".
Walter Stanley Keane  was an American plagiarist who became famous in the 1950s  for claiming he had painted a series of widely reproduced paintings depicting vulnerable waifs with enormous eyes. Inspired in 1948, his concept for these paintings originated with ""Susie Keane's Puppeteers"", wide eyed puppets hand painted by Walter Keane, clothing designed and sewn by Barbara Keane, named after their daughter Susan Keane. The paintings were in fact painted by his wife Margaret Keane. When she made this fact public, Walter Keane retaliated with a USA Today article that again claimed he had done the work. So in 1986 Margaret Keane sued both Walter and USA Today. In the subsequent slander suit the judge demanded that the litigants paint a painting in the courtroom, but Walter declined, citing a sore shoulder. Margaret then painted before the jurors in 53 minutes. The jury awarded her damages of 4 million.
Big Eyes - The Hollywood Movie about Walter And Margaret Kane opens this month.
A drama centered on the awakening of the painter Margaret Keane, her phenomenal success in the 1950s, and the subsequent legal difficulties she had with her husband, who claimed credit for her works in the 1960s. Director: Tim Burton
Professional Photo lab Print measures 5x7 inches glossy - paperstock is Fuji Crystal Archive.
 Ships unmated and unframed with clear protective sleeve between cardboard. 
This would make an outstanding gift!

            This is a very darling Reuge wooden Hummel music box.  It hangs on the wall and has a string you pull down that winds and plays the musical box inside.  It is so unique and has a charming scene of a boy with his belongings going on a hiking trip in the Swiss Alps.  Made in Germany.
In very good vintage condition.  There are scratches across the front.  That is the only flaw I see.  It is still an exquisite piece to add to your collection or give as a baby shower gift or to a collector.  They will love it for sure!
Measures 5 inches across.  Works perfectly.  It reminds me of wonderful childhood memories of visits to antique stores filled with amazing gifts from around the world.

8145,Optometrist Gift - Coffee Mug for Eye Doctor - Opthamologist Joke Humor,"
            Here's a funny mug for your favorite eye doctor or optometrist's assistant
Mugs are available in multiple styles. Select your option when ordering.
<<< Customization    
Customization can be done, but you MUST select the appropriate option when ordering. Select an option with the word ""Custom"" and provide your custom text in the Notes to Seller.  Custom text is printed on the opposite side of the mug (unless otherwise requested).
Please send your personalization text in the Notes of the order.
<<< About Our Mugs    
We offer ceramic mugs as well as stainless steel travel mugs. The text and/or image on each mug is very sharp - we do not allow poor quality mugs to leave the shop.
Ceramic mugs are dishwasher and microwave safe because of the dye sublimation process that we use. This process chemically bonds the ink to the mug surface. You can expect your mug to last a very long time with regular use.
Steel mugs are dishwasher safe but are NOT microwave safe (for obvious reasons).
(Handwashing is preferred, but not necessary)
<<< Production and Shipping    
We make our mugs nearly every day so we ship very quickly, usually in 1-2 business days (longer for larger orders).
If you need your order by a certain day please ask ahead of time - we will respond quickly.
Mugs are shipped via USPS Priority mail and are packed very well. We rarely have a mug break during shipping, but please read our Policies for how we handle this.        ",13.99,4.9384,"Handmade item

            Cake mascara is a terrific product that can be used as a lash color or an eyeliner.  It is easy to apply and leaves your lashes soft and natural looking.
ZERO  WASTE  container.    
If you want to learn more about the Zero Waste Community, visit my friend Emilie's blog for tips and info.  
a-greener-way.tumblr.com
Please Note  I am happy to ship plastic free and without the disposable brush at your request.  Plain envelope without plastic bubbles, without the interior plastic bag.  Let me know in comments to sellers at checkout.  
.25 oz tin   2""L x 1""W x 3/8""D
 ***NO PARABEN is used***.  All natural preservative replaces it.
VEGAN
CRUELTY FREE
FRAGRANCE FREE
It goes on smoothly and doesn't clump or flake.  You really have complete control with it as far as how much volume you have.  It keeps your lashes soft and natural looking.
  
***To use*** : Simply wet your mascara spoolie brush and rub it over your mascara cake.  You can add more water to your brush if it seems too dry.  Don't put water directly into the tin.  Apply a thin coat of mascara and allow it to dry completely before you apply another.  A second coat will give a fuller, thicker, look.  Use an eyeliner brush and follow the same directions, to line your eyes.***
The formula is vegan.   Soywax is used,not beeswax.  No fibers are used to volumize as they can irritate your eyes.  Waterproof formulas can also be irritating to your eyes so I do not use those chemicals.   Creamy cake mascara is long lasting on your lashes and holds up great in humidity.   It's great for sensitive eyes and for those who wear contact lenses.
  *****The mascara is creamy when I pour it into the container.  It will dry down in the tin, get firm and actually look like dried mud with cracks in it.  This is normal and does not affect the quality or performance of the mascara;  It is simply what happens when the moisture evaporates from it.  It is packaged in a slide tin container for easy use and comes with a disposable spoolie brush.  This brush can be your mainstay or you can get another style where you find quality brushes and cosmetic tools.*****
 
Here are the ingredients: xanthan gum, gum arabic, stearic acid, potassium sorbate, soywax, carnauba wax, glycerin, black oxide, candelilla wax, aloe vera juice, ceteareeth-20, cyclo-dimethicone.

The cases are MADE TO ORDER for iPhone 5 / 5c / 5s / SE / 6 / 6s / 6 / 6s / 7 / 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge / S7 / S6 Edge / S6 / S5 / S4.
Processing Time: 
Your case will be Made and Shipped out in ONE (1) Week or LESS (Typically 3-4 business days). On rare occasions when I cannot ship out your order within 1 week, I will contact you and let you know.
Description:
The flowers are natural flowers that hold their flamboyant color as they are dried and pressed. The flowers are placed on the back of the phone case and sealed with a layer of resin after the resin cures. Flowers are completely covered with resin and normally the surface of the case is flat and smooth. However, occasional bumpiness on the case surface due to the thickness of flowers is normal and expected. This should not affect the look and functionality of your case. Also, due to each phone case being handmade, there may be minor imperfections such as small air bubbles and small amount of resin on the side. 
When you purchase a specific listing/design, you will get exactly that design (if you want to create your own design or change an existing design, you can purchase the custom order listing above). I will make the flower design as close as possible to the one in the picture. Please keep in mind that these cases are made to order and not every flower will look exactly the same as in the picture. However, I can assure you that the design will look as close and beautiful as the design in the picture. Also note that the design may be mirrored/flipped horizontally to best suit the design to the model of your phone.
You can choose between our two (2) types of phone cases: Hard Plastic Snap-On Case and Bumper Case.
Slim Case
- Fits tightly onto your phone and protects the corners as well as left and right sides of the phone

10440,Custom Hardwood Guitar Bodies,"
            *Please read the description and contact me if you have any questions before ordering - Laminate bodies like the one in the first photo on this listing start at 300 CDN for a standard body shape (tele, strat, lp), standard routing, and no finish.*
Ever wanted to make your own guitar, but don't have the tools or know-how to cut and route wood?  Have a damaged body that needs replacing?  Got some extra hardware lying around that you want to put to use?
Get a unique Dolmage Designs guitar body from 200. All bodies come with a matching solid wood control cavity cover.  Matching or contrasting pickup rings (either for tele neck pickups or humbuckers) are also available.
Bodies are hand-made based on CNC templates for accurate layout of pickups and neck pocket.  Bodies are available in traditional single- and double-cutaway designs.  Do you have a unique design in mind for your guitar?  Contact me to discuss your project.
Domestic hardwood bodies (ash, alder, eastern or western maple, cherry, or sapele mahogany) sanded but unfinished are 200.  Finished bodies in either oil and wax (semi-gloss natural finish) or polyurethane (durable gloss finish) are 250.
Exotic hardwoods, bent wood laminating, contrasting inlaid tops, and other unique and beautiful options are available - please contact me  before ordering for prices.  A rough guideline is exotic hardwood body will add 60-80, laminate stripes will add 25 each, and a highly figured inlaid top (see the photo of the maple and walnut guitar above) would add 100  - so an exotic hardwood guitar with two contrasting stripes with no finish would be approximately 350, while a domestic hardwood body with exotic inlaid top and oil and wax finish would also be 350.

            just choose the length you'd like. 
LENGTH
choose which length you like and that's the minimum you get but you may get a little more too !!
25 meters = 27 yards this length is great when you just need a little for trims, tassels or pom poms
50 meters = 55 yards
100 meters = 110 yards will make a cute little scarf or a beanie/hat
200 meters = 220 yards a scarf and beanie or hand warmers
** these are approximate and will vary between knitters/crocheters and patterns used.
this is a 3 ply, n-ply yarn. slightly thick and thin.
CONTENTS
super soft 17.5 - 19.5 micron australian merino wool in shades of black through to greys.
this is a 3 ply yarn, so quite dense and rope like. great for those big projects on big hooks and needles.
** i use local australian farm wools where possible from happy animals that roam around and do their thing outside in nature. this means i clean and dye the fleeces myself. i do my best but you may find the occasional piece of grass or twig. they're easy to remove by plucking or flicking with your finger nails.
** listing is for yarn pictured only and not any props used in the photos.
CARE
may bleed a little for first few washes.
cool gentle hand wash. do not agitate, do not wring out water, do not use harsh detergents.
lay flat to dry in shade. do not tumble dry.
** remember heat and agitation cause felt.
** hand dyed and may still bleed a little extra dye in the first few washes.

            Tenaya created the #PaperGem kit for the young maker that wants to try a quick wearable tech project they can be proud of.  In collaboration with Lindsay Balfour, epic paper engineer, the kit is designed to teach paper folding in creative ways, then combine that with the use of copper tape to make a circuit.  2 #PaperGem kits come in the Variety Pack, for best results, make them together so you can all compare and learn!  There is a suggested outcome, but every creation is still different so share yours with #PaperGem on social media with #RogueMaking too!  Next try the #CircuitCard kit which teaches how to make a switch with paper circuits.  Surprise someone special this holiday with a light-up card.
#Patribotic is a fun kit, much like #BumbleBot, but with an Independence Day theme.  Engineering is playing and making adjustments, additions, and subtractions is all part of the fun.  Create a habitat for your bot, a maze, a race, or other bot challenges!
Using the Pager Motor and the coincell battery, create a circuit that will buzz on your table.  By wedging it in the piece of foam provided, you can start to design your own bot by observing how it moves on its own.  Add pieces to add weight, or see what the pipettes can do.  Any young maker can play with this kit for hours, try adding your own upcycle items like “pizza tables” or tiny cream containers.  Every creation is different, feel free to share yours with #Patribotic on social media with #RogueMaking too!

16266,"Chalk Marker Bold Set (8 Neon Colors) - Erasable Chalk Pens for Chalkboard Signs, Wedding Chalkboards, Glass, Metal, Plastic & Ceramic","
            The Premier Brand of Chalk Markers for Professionals
High-quality Versachalk wet erase markers are dust-free and easy to erase. They create sharper lines—perfect for complicated designs. The premium liquid chalk ink from Germany lasts longer and does not cause accidental smudging, so you don’t have to worry about erasures and revamping artwork. Designs done with Versachalk liquid chalk markers emulate the handmade quality of regular chalk while maintaining a clean and polished look.
 
Versachalk Liquid Chalk Markers versus Ordinary Chalk
✓ NO MESSY CHALK DUST—Liquid chalk ink is dustless—perfect for those prone to allergies, asthma, dust sensitivity, or just anyone tired of breathing in chalk dust!
✓ BRIGHTER LINES—Chalk pens draw smoother and brighter. None of those pale streaks from regular chalk.
✓ WRITE ON ANYTHING—Draw on any non-porous surface, including glass windows, plastic containers, metal serving platters, faux-wood veneer... or even your refrigerator!
 
The World is Your Chalkboard!
Michelangelo had the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Students and teachers the world over have... the chalkboard. Botticelli had the paintbrush. We have… liquid chalk markers!
 
The brilliance of having liquid chalk markers in your artist’s toolkit is that you can take them anywhere and use them everywhere (almost*). Why limit yourself?
 
Decorate wine glasses with swirls and monograms. Draw a calendar on your refrigerator door. Label your mason jars by writing directly on their chalkboard lids. Write or draw on cut-up chalkboard vinyl sheets in different shapes and sizes. Stick them on your choice of container or bric-a-brac. Name your plants by using liquid chalk directly on metal pots or write on chalkboard labels and stick them onto planters.
 
Place your carwash advertising on a window. Entice diners with mouthwatering menus. Pretend you’re Einstein and solve the world’s problems with diagrams on whiteboards. Exhibit graffiti on a truck (with permission, of course). Recreate the globe by making up your own countries. Decorate your cat’s scratching post. Emulate street artists by sketching hopscotch squares on your driveway. Propose to your girlfriend (or boyfriend) on her/his bedroom wall. Apologize to your parents by scribbling a gigantic SORRY on a windshield. Just make sure it belongs to your car, not theirs! With liquid chalk markers, the possibilities are endless. We invite you to spread your art throughout the world.
 
* Versachalk liquid chalk markers are easily erasable and smear-free when used on non-porous surfaces, including:
✓ chalkboards
✓ glass
✓ slate
✓ vinyl

16665,"Layered necklace spacer clasp, gold, silver or Rose gold, no more tangle, no more mess. detangling, detangled, Layering magic!","
            Finally - No more tangle!!!
This layered necklace spacer is nothing short of magic :)
I was soooo put off by my layered necklaces constantly twisting, rolling and tangling - I decided it's time to come up with a simple solution!
I was reluctant myself in the beginning (could it really work?!?!) - but after vigorous testing, as in wearing layered necklaces and for once not having to untangle them every 5 minutes, I am completely convinced! 
IT WORKS :) :)
It is so simple and effortless: simply attache any necklaces to the spacer clasp and hook it on behind your neck.
The spacer is a clasp - it opens by pulling the tubes apart and closes by sliding them back together (the smaller tube slides into the larger one. Super easy).
One side has loops to attache your necklaces clasps onto.
The other side has little clasps - to attache onto the ring end of your necklaces.
You can mix and match any necklaces and change them as often as you like - nothing is permanent :)  Create endless layering combinations and see how they hang effortlessly perfect.
Choose size:
2-clasp spacer
3-clasp spacer
Choose finish:
Gold (tubes are gold plated, little clasps are 14k gold filled)
Silver (tubes are silver plated, little clasps are 925 sterling silver)
Rose gold filled (tubes are rose gold plated, little clasps are 14k rose gold filled)

            The shoes are called ""Jarmilki""- they are guaranteed to be high quality as the product comes from EU and not China. The shoes were very popular throughout the European history and their design haven't been changed since almost 40 years. They are hand-decorated in Poland.
Brooches are made from a felt. Brooches can be attached to shoes of other color - the whole variety can be seen in one of the photos. 
The sizes available are as follows:
The US sizes are women's sizes. The length in cm is the lenght of the sole- the shoes are a bit smaller inside, but it will smooth a little.
35 EU / 5 US / 23cm
36 EU / 6 US / 23.5cm
37 EU / 6½ US / 24cm
37.5 EU / 7 US / 24.5cm
38 EU / 7½ US / 25cm
38.5 EU / 8 US / 25.5cm
39 EU / 8½ US / 26cm
40 EU / 9 US / 26.5cm
41 EU / 9½ US / 27cm
42 EU / 10 US / 28cm   Important: They are available but they are heavier than other sizes and you will have to pay additional shipping costs (they go into a higher parcel weight category), the additional costs vary from 3-11 (it depends of shipping destination) - ask me for more info.
If your decide to buy a pair- remember to mail me with information of the color and shoe size!
See more of my works in the link below. If you would like any of those- just send me a message and we can see if I still remember how to make it! ;)
