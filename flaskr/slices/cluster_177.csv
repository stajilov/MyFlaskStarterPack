2417,100 Swarovski Crystal chatons - 1st quality machine cut art 1100 1012 huge mix of loose rhinestones for Crystal Clay mostly small and tiny,"
            **PLEASE NOTE*** These lots are not large stones - they are primarily tiny and small with a few medium stones here and there.  Tiny meaning as small as 1 or 2mm in width.  If you are looking for a lot of large and medium sized stones this is not your lot.
This listing is for more than 100 genuine, 1st quality Swarovski crystal rhinestone chatons in a variety of sizes and colors.
These are all faceted backed stones (not flatbacks) and are absolutely perfect for crystal clay. Most have gold foiled backs but some have silver foil and others are unfoiled (jet, chalkwhite, and a few others)
The mix that your 100 stones will be scooped from contains the following colors: Jet, Jet Hematite, Crystal, Crystal AB, Crystal Aurum, Crystal Comet Argent Light, Siam, Light Siam, Ruby, Hyacinth, Topaz, Lt. Colorado Topaz, Light Colorado Topaz AB,  Smoked Topaz, Jonquil, Olivine, Emerald, Emerald AB, Peridot AB, Green Turmaline, Aquamarine, Blue Zircon, Light Azore, Sapphire, Sapphire AB, Light Sapphire, Light Sapphire AB, Montana, Amethyst, Amethyst AB, Light Amethyst, Light Amethyst AB, Light Rose, Light Rose AB, Fuchsia, Fuchsia AB, Rose, Chalk white, Chalkwhite AB, and more.
You  will receive a generous amount over 100 stones.  
The first two photos to show you the scale of these stones.  One with a ruler on each side (millimeters on the right, inches on the left) and one with a standard pencil.
The last photo shows a sample scoop but every lot will be different. I cannot guaranty which colors or sizes you will get but it will be a nice variety at an excellent price.
**Again - Please Note*** These lots are not large stones - they are primarily tiny and small with a few medium stones here and there.  Tiny meaning as small as 1 or 2mm in width.  If you are looking for a lot of large and medium sized stones this is not your lot.
These are beautiful stones and a great variety for repair, crafting, jewelry making, and especially for epoxy clay work.
PLEASE NOTE - I take a great deal of time taking large, detailed, accurate photos and writing detailed descriptions. Please take the time to look and zoom in on all of the photos as well as reading the full description.
I recently made some large purchases totaling over 1,000,000 Swarovski rhinestones which I have listed here for you by color and size as well as this mixed assortment and others by color.
I purchased these in their original package.
These are not beads - they do not have holes. 
I invite you to read my store policies as well as my about page to learn more about my shop and what I have to offer here on Etsy. 
I usually ship within 1 business day of your purchase - sometimes 2. :)

In a very old British tradition, the bride is given a token of good fortune and prosperity with a sixpence which she wears in her shoe on her Wedding Day. A traditional lucky charm, the idea that metal brings good fortune - think charm bracelets, horse shoes . . . Sisters, bridesmaids and family and friends looking for the lucky charms could pass on the one of these tokens of good luck.
These genuine old sixpence coins have been gently buffed to enhance the markings, whilst retaining their patina of age.

            This RARE Disney Steamboat Willie Musical Snowglobe was originally purchased from Disney World in Florida. It plays the tune 'Mickey Mouse March'. The snow globe is clear & sparkles beautifully. When you wind it up & see the sparkles....you feel like you're right there in Disney World! 
This wonderful Disney Snowglobe is in very good vintage condition with only minor flaws....        two characters have 1 broken arm each; Porky Pig & Pinocchio both have broken left arms (see the close up picture #5) There is so much going on in this steamboat full of Disney characters that it's truly not noticeable.
This rare collectible Disney Musical Snow Globe is a 75 year Disney commemorative....a must have for serious Disney collectors. A great gift for a grandchild, too.

            Beautiful handmade crewel embroidery wall hanging from the 1970s/80s.  Golden sunflowers, pink hyacinth, pale pink Nicotiana, purple petunias, and some other pretty pink flower that escapes me at the moment.
The frame is nothing fantastic, gold tone, but the embroidery piece is lovely and in well preserved condition.  Obviously matted at home, but it has held up all these years.
Embroidery piece measures 24"" x 18"" without the frame.  With the frame it measures 26 5/8"" x 20 3/4"".

8284,"Natural Deodorant, Blueberry Violets - Aluminum Free Deodorant - Ripe Blueberries, Violet Flowers","
            
➤ Scent: Blueberry Violets
➤ Product Type: Deodorant Stick
➤ Size: 3.3 oz.
➤ Price: 8.50
➤ Blueberry Violets - 
A harmonious blend of sweet and tangy blueberries with lush violets. Bright and wonderfully exotic, this juicy fragrance is the perfect blend of wild fruit and floral.
➤ Our bodies are supposed to sweat as a natural cooling and cleansing cycle. By using antiperspirants, we are actually impeding our body’s natural defenses against moisture and the bacteria that can grow there. All antiperspirants contain aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex. This possible cancer causing agent stops sweat by filling your pores with aluminum salts and essentially blocking sweat from exiting your body. 
➤ Live Beautifully deodorants are not antiperspirants. They are an all natural alternative that actually works. They will help you sweat less, sweat cleaner, and smell better.
• All deodorant sticks are sealed for tamper resistant and sanitary packaging.
➤ Notes on Use -
• This product will not melt in your bathroom and you do not have to store it in the fridge. 
• You do not need a lot to be effective - slide up only what you need for each usage. When applied thinly, it will not leave any white residue or deodorant marks on your skin or clothes.
• You may notice additional sweating the first few days of use. Think of this as your body detoxifying and ridding itself of all of the harmful chemicals and additives it was receiving.
➤ No artificial preservatives, fragrances, or unnaturalness in our blends. Live Beautifully does not test our products on our animal friends and we make sure each and every one of our suppliers and sources does the same!
➤ Natural Ingredients: Beeswax, Caprylic/ Capric Triglyceride (Fractionated Coconut Oil), Butyrospermum parkii (Shea Butter), Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), Zea Mays (Corn) Starch,  Natural Fragrances,  Tocopherol (Vitamin E)

8291,All Natural Deodorant Sticks-An all-natural deodorant in a stick,"
            Conventional wisdom suggests that perspiration is the cause of body odor. However, perspiration by itself is basically odorless, but it is the bacteria and odors coming from other sources that are the real culprits. Anaerobic bacteria, which flourish when your body doesn't have enough oxygen, may well be the cause of your body odor. As the body's metabolism goes to work, it gives off an odor which is the body's way of ridding itself of waste products. Any imbalances in metabolism will result in stronger odors. For a lot of people, a lack of magnesium is the culprit. Our deodorant is made with magnesium. Our stick version has less magnesium than our cream deodorant but is still very effective for most people. 
- Mineral deficiencies, particularly of zinc and magnesium, are more likely to cause body odor.
- Our deodorant has NO Aluminum, NO Parabens, NO Toxic Chemicals, NO Artificial Fragrances, NO GMOs and absolutely NO Bad Stuff EVER!!
-You should give your new natural deodorant 7-10 days (possibly 2 weeks) before you decide whether or not it is for you. This gives your body time to do its detoxing and adjust to its new body care routine. 
-The longer you use your natural deodorant, the better you will like it. Give your body and your deodorant time to do their respective jobs.
-Easy to apply stick version. 
Imagine a deodorant, not only giving you protection from smell, but giving you a nutritional boost also. That is smart thinking. 
Directions: Apply a small amount of deodorant to the armpit area as needed. Don’t use to much or you may experience some oil residue on your clothing. Using a grease removing dish detergent is all that is needed to remove oil stains if you accidently apply to much. 
Essential Oil List: Each container varies. All of our scents are derived from nature. 
Ingredients: Magnesium oil, olive oil, coconut oil, beeswax, arrowroot powder, kaolin clay, tapioca flour, natural emulsifier phytomulse (naturally derived cetearyl alcohol & glyceryl stearate & coceth-20), essential oil or plant based scent, naturally derived preservative ECO (benzyl alcohol, salicylic acid, glycerin, sorbic acid), and hops co2
All of our products are formulated to be in accordance with current safety standards. We follow the guidelines based on FDA recommendations.

It is the consumer’s responsibility to research ingredients to ensure they are not contraindicated for you or your medications. We may not list all the contraindications and/or safety concerns here so please consult with your doctor to address any health issues.

8292,"Dragon's Blood Deodorant, Aluminum Free Deodorant, Natural Deodorant, Chemical Free Deodorant, Artisan Deodorant","
            Our Dragon's Blood Deodorant has a wonderful mixture of scents such as: amber, vanilla, rose, jasmine, lilac, orange, grapefruit and patchouli.
Ancient Bath and Body's deodorants are aluminum free, chemical free, all natural deodorants made with organic extra virgin coconut oil and other natural pure ingredients. 
~~Benefits~~
Arrowroot powder is essential for absorbing perspiration and baking soda helps pull the toxins right out of your body. Organic extra virgin coconut oil is a bonus for its antibacterial properties. Beeswax is known for its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anti-allergenic and is a germicidal antioxidant. It moisturizes the skin at the same time protecting you from environmental factors.
~~Directions~~
1-2 slow swipes should do the trick for many hours. This is a natural product so you might have to swipe slowly for the natural oils to heat up with your skin just enough for it to go on smoothly, especially if you live in colder climates. 
Important notes: If you are use to using every day commercial deodorants with harmful chemicals please give this time to take effect. Harmful deodorants especially “antiperspirants” keep toxins in your body. Give your body’s natural oils and natural healing time to get use to the natural deodorant. I promise the wait will be worth it! Some people have sensitivity to baking soda due to its pH level average of 8.3. 
Vegetarian friendly!!!

8298,Peace Pits All-Natural Aluminum-Free Deodorant Paste -  Organic Vegan Deodorant - 2 oz. Glass Jar - Eco Friendly Packaging,"
            Peace Pits All-Natural Aluminum-Free Deodorant was made with your health in mind. Alzheimer's AND Breast Cancer have both been linked to aluminum based deodorants, as well as many other medical issues thanks to the pthalates, parabens, and chemical fragrances that most store bought deodorants contain. Peace Pits is FREE of ALL HARSH AND TOXIC CHEMICALS! I use all natural organic ingredients to fight the stink that living our daily lives can bring. If you are a first time user of a baking soda deodorant it may be a good idea to start with the sensitive version first as to rule out any sensitivity issues. It is not as strong as regular, but it may save you from an unpleasant rash due to the baking soda.
After trying many recipes, this one was the only one that gave me ALL DAY PROTECTION! Even after a hot yoga class, I was still not stinking in my armpits! My husband decided to jump on the bandwagon and try mine out, which means he has been wearing grapefruit lavender for quite a long time! He LOVES this stuff and says he never has problems with stinking, and it lasts all day long for him. It never leaves any stains or marks on any of my clothing (including that cute little black dress!), and whatever is left on your fingers after rubbing it in, you can use as a moisturizer for your hands! 
You can choose between these scents:
* Bay Spice (west indies bay, clove, lime, and sweet orange)
* Cedar & Clove (A manly smell of woods, spice, and a hint of lime)
* Citrus Mint (A Fresh zinger!)
* Flower Power (Lavender, rose, chamomile, ylang ylang)
* Grapefruit Lavender (A bright fruity scent)
* Lavender
* Lavender & Cedarwood
* Lavender Lemongrass
* Lime & Vanilla
* Man of the Woods (A manly combination of pine, cypress, cedarwood, and juniper berry)
* Morning Fresh (A bright blend of grapefruit, lime, lemon, basil, and lavender)
* Mountain Man (A fresh invigorating blend of icy cold peppermint, cypress, juniper berry and pine) 
* Peppermint Sage
* Sweet Oranges & Clove
* Tea Tree & Chamomile
* unscented (no essential oils added)
Feel free to type in second choice in ""notes to seller"" spot if you can not find the scent listed.
NOTE TO THOSE NEW TO NATURAL DEODORANT: If you have been using commercial deodorants, your body is going to need to detox the aluminum from it. Some people experience rashes and or itchy pits for up to a week after they make the switch to natural deodorants. If this rash persists, discontinue use of this deodorant and allow to heal before using any natural deodorants. All sales are final.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE: Dab a small amount onto your fingers and apply gently to the under arms, massaging into the skin. A little bit goes a LONG way! The coconut oil and shea butter will cause the paste to melt on contact, allowing for it to sink into the skin easier.   You should only need to use once a day, but if needed, a second application is acceptable. Wait 1-2 hours after shaving, before applying this to your armpits.
WARNING: This item is not meant to replace the word of a Doctor. Please consult a Doctor before use of any products for any severe problems or emergencies. Pregnant or nursing women should always consult their Doctor before use of any products containing essential oils. 
INGREDIENTS: organic unrefined extra-virgin coconut oil, organic unrefined shea butter, organic arrowroot powder, baking soda, vitamin e, essential oils (If you have allergies to something specific, please send me a conversation and I can make a version that takes that into account!)

The Good JuJu Herbal Dry Body Brush is a wooden bath brush made of natural, semi-soft bristles and is made to stimulate the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of tissues and organs that help rid the body of toxins and waste. Along with normalizing lymph flow and softening skin dry brushing can leave pores clearer, and your whole body with more energy.
U S E
When using the natural body brush it is best to brush in circular motions towards your heart (I.e. Ankle to thigh) to help stimulate the body's lymphatic system. Use this brush 2-3 times a week before getting in the shower or bath to help exfoliate and soften skin.

This dry body brush pairs perfectly with a beautiful bar of soap to make the perfect gift, for a friend or for yourself.

8916,"All Natural Deodorant / AntiPerspirant - Contains Healing Clay,  Free of Aluminum, Parabens, Artificial Chemicals and Fragrances","
            With all the recent studies reporting about the harmful chemicals (especially aluminum) present in conventional, store-bought deodorants, it's no wonder people are searching for healthier alternatives - products they can feel good about putting on their skin, myself included.
After extensive research and testing, we have come up with the perfect alternative to the chemically-laden, mass-produced deodorants on the market today.  And ours will keep you feeling dry and smelling fresh!
Each ingredient in our deodorant / antiperspirant serves a specific purpose (ie no fillers!!) in making our product extremely effective:
ORGANIC VIRGIN COCONUT OIL - Antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-fungal, antibacterial and soothing qualities
ORGANIC UNREFINED SHEA BUTTER - Exceptionally high content of Vitamins A and E and other nutrients 
ORGANIC UNREFINED COCOA BUTTER - High in fatty acids and antioxidants, which help fight off free radicals.  Also high in Vitamin E, which aids in skin renewal.
ARROWROOT POWDER - Unlike cornstarch, which is made from corn that has been genetically engineered, arrowroot is a natural lovely, soft powder, which has great moisture-absorbing properties.  Whisks away sweat like no one's business!
ORGANIC BEESWAX- Another natural ingredient that has antiperspirant qualities and helps make our product nice and thick
BAKING SODA - A naturally-occurring substance known to fight and absorb odor
BENTONITE CLAY - This right here is the REAL star in our product!  Bentonite, a very fine grey powder which is odorless and non-staining, is one of the most effective and powerful healing clays.  It's known for its ability to absorb and remove toxins, heavy metals, impurities, and chemicals from the body - especially important if you've been using standard store-bought deodorant for years.
PURE ESSENTIAL OILS - Each of our therapeutic-grade essential oils increases the effectiveness of our product,  has antibacterial properties and also adds a fresh, clean natural fragrance.
Our deodorant / antiperspirant comes in a 2.65 oz wide-mouthed deodorant tube.  Due to the Bentonite Clay, this product is dark greenish in color; however, it should not stain clothes or skin.
Directions: Apply a light layer to clean, dry underarms after showering or bathing. Reapply, as needed, 1-2 times a day.   If you live in an exceptionally hot climate, you may want to store the product in the refrigerator.
A QUICK WORD ON SWITCHING FROM REGULAR DEODORANT TO NATURAL DEODORANT:  If you've used regular deodorant for years, your body may go through a detox period when switching to natural deodorant.  Your armpits may become red and irritated in the first few days but, with consistent use, this will discontinue.  Also, you may notice an increase in odor and sweat for the first few days.  This is perfectly normal, as it's your body's way of getting rid of all the toxins and harmful chemicals which have been absorbed over a period of years.  
** Warning: Sage essential oil is not safe for pregnant women and has some side effects for women who are nursing.  If you have any concerns about this, I'm able to make this product without this specific essential oil. **        ",8.50,4.9109,"Handmade item

Rosa damascena, the damask rose, has been treasured for centuries for it's extraordinary scent. It takes many pounds of rose petals to distill one ounce of essential oil. Depending on extraction method and plant species, the average yield can range from 1:1,500 to 1:10,000.

Come, meet the worldwide trees, plants, and flower Superstars that power your balm:
Argan Oil, from Women’s cooperatives in Morocco:
A New York Times editorial called it “liquid gold.” Argan oil is comprised of roughly 80% fatty acids which work wonders to erase signs of premature aging. Anti-oxidants in Argan oil help to protect skin, hair, and nails from damage caused by UV radiation, and by promoting the regeneration of healthy cells.
Starflower, a.k.a. Borage oil: 
Borage seed oil contains 17-28% of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and is the richest   known source.
Rose Hip Seed Oil, Rosa canina, Organic, Cold pressed, From Chile.
RHS Oil is extremely high in essential fatty acids, provitamin A, antioxidants, phytonutrients,  and has an amazing ability to hydrate, while still being classified as a ‘dry’ oil, meaning that is does not feel greasy , or oily, on the skin. It quickly absorbs into the skin replenishing moisture and creates a protective barrier on the skin to help prevent dehydration. Rose Hip Seed oil is cold pressed from rosehip seeds that grow on wild rose bushes. It is a gorgeous, rich, golden orange color.
Shea Butter / Beurre de Karite
Shea butter is a superb moisturizer, with exceptional healing properties.  It is edible, and used in food preparation. It has been used as a valued moisturizer for centuries, and melts at body temperature. Shea Butter is naturally rich in Vitamins A, E, and F, as well as a number of other vitamins and minerals. Vitamins A and E help to soothe, hydrate, and balance the skin. Vitamin F contains essential fatty acids, and helps protect and revitalize damaged skin. Shea Butter is an intense moisturizer for dry skin, and is a wonderful product for revitalizing dull or dry skin. The shea tree is also know as the Karite tree, which means, Tree of Life. Botanical Name, Butyrospermum parkii
Sunflower seed Oil, from France, Food Grade
The wild sunflower is native to North America, and first domesticated by Native Americans  Some archaeologists suggest that sunflower may have been domesticated before corn.The Sunflower was taken to Europe by Spanish explorers some time around 1500. The plant became widespread throughout present-day Western Europe mainly as an ornamental, but some medicinal uses were developed. By 1716, an English patent was granted for squeezing oil from sunflower seed.
Sunflower oil is high in the essential vitamin E, sterols, and squalene.Folate or folic acid, present in sunflower oil, helps the body in the manufacture of new cells. Sunflower oil works as a protective and moisturizing solution for skin. 
Sunflower oil comes from sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seeds. 
Helianthus ( Greek ) comes from “helios” which means sun and “anthos” meaning flower.
Coconut Oil, Organic, Food Grade
The combination of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-bacterial and hydrating properties make it truly unique. Like coconuts themselves, coconut oil is rich in many proteins. These proteins keep skin healthy and rejuvenated, both internally and externally. Proteins also contribute to cellular health and tissue repair
The fatty acids in coconut oil have strong disinfectant and antimicrobial properties. The contributions of vitamin E towards skin care are well known. It is essential for healthy skin growth, repair of wear & tear on the skin, keeping skin smooth and protecting against cracking. Above all, it prevents premature aging and wrinkling of the skin, since it has good antioxidant properties.
Candelilla wax, wildcrafted
Candelilla wax is a vegan wax derived from the leaves of a small shrub native to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It produced a golden colored, very hard wax that has a glossy characteristic.

Length: 6 in, 1 5 10 Feet

Packaging: Good packaging. This wire is new and comes from a large spool. The wire is then coiled and wrapped with plastic wrap. Multiple quantity comes in one uncut piece!

What is Sterling Silver?
Sterling silver is an alloy of silver containing 92.5% by weight of silver and 7.5% by weight of other metals (in this case is copper). The sterling silver standard has a minimum millesimal fineness of 925.
What is the difference between Half Hard and Dead Soft?
Half Hard and Dead Soft stands for hardness of the wire. Dead Soft is not too hard to bend. It is easy for bending, looping and flowing curves and spirals. This is good for wire wrapping. Half Hard is good for making sharp angles. This is good for making products where you want them to stay in shape for example ear wires, clasps, jump rings, necklace foundations, bracelet forms or even personalized wire name jewelry.
