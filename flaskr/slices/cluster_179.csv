Item Description:
~Dimensions: (Approx.)
Thickness:  .060 inch(1.53mm) 
Length: 3.875 inches (9.85cm)
Width: 2.00 inches (5.08cm)
Slot measures: 1/8"" x 5/8"" (3.2mm x 16mm)
 
~Material: Heavy gauge Anodized Aluminum

Each tag comes complete with a Heavy Duty Plastic strap.
We use a laser engraver to engrave the surface of this item. Laser engraving removes a very thin layer of the anodized metal, turning it white. You can feel it a tiny bit with your finger but it is not deep, allowing for much more writing and double sided engraving. Laser engraving produces white lettering that will not fade or rub off.

            This listing is for an antique, clear glass, apothecary bottle labelled ""Liq. Ferr. Perchl"" . The bottle has a glass stopper with a flat round knob.
This vintage apothecary jar is marked “W.T. & Co. B” on the base. It was made by Whitall Tatum & Company between 1875 and 1901.
The bottle is in good condition but there are some areas of damage to note:
  -  staining around the bottle opening and stopper;
  -  a chip to the underside of the flat round opening to the bottle;
  -  there are air bubbles visible in the glass;
  -  a stain to the inside base of the bottle; and
  -  some wear, consistent with age, to the bottle label.
The bottle stands 20cm (7.8 inches) tall. With the stopper in place it is 22cm (8.6 inches) tall. The base has a diameter of 7cm (2.7 inches).
This is wonderful antique bottle would look great on display alone or in a group.  It would also be a fabulous gift for a medical student, chemist or someone with an interest in medical history.
Note:  This listing is for one bottle only, the bottle labelled ""Liq. Ferr. Perchl."".  The other bottle shown in the 2nd photograph above is available for purchase separately.  Here is a link to the ""Ol. Bergam"" bottle shown above:

            A lovely pair of mid century gloves by BRI Nylon.
These were a pair of my Mothers gloves, which she very occasionally wore.
***Please note that the gloves are both the same colour. With my limited photography skills, I could not get better pictures to show this***
Very pretty pattern on the uppers, plain palms/undersides and fingers.
Please excuse my chubby hands in the pictures.  They are for a more slender wrist than mine!
These gloves are in a nylon or man made fabric, and the label says Made in England.
Size 7
They have been freshly laundered.
Extremely good vintage condition.
No holes or damage.
They have a light brownish mark on the side of the index finger of the left glove (shown in pic 5).
It should wash out, but having not tried, cannot be 100% sure.
 
I would not recommend machine washing this item - hand wash only.

I will be adding more items of ceramics, crystal and glass, lace, vintage clothing and ephemera etc., in the near future, so please keep popping by to see what's new. Most days I add to my inventory.

            THIS is the toy that started it all when a naughty little kitty got into my scrap bin and brought a piece of buffalo fur upstairs. When I saw it, I squealed like a little school girl! A mouse in the house with 7 kitties??? Then.....bam....light bulb! The next moment I was downstairs creating the very first buffalo fur mouse.  It is still my best selling cat toy.  The wild scent of the buffalo/bison fur drives most kitties wild!  
This listing is for one (1) Buffalo Mouse.
Details: Made with real  American Buffalo / Bison leather, stuffed with wool and USA grown organic catnip or catnip/silvervine mix (optional). 
Size: Approximately 3"" x 2"". Fur length varies and adds extra size. The color, fur length and wackiness varies.  You can choose between ""Way Wacky"" and ""Not so Wacky"".  (The longer the fur, the wackier the toy. If you choose ""Not so Wacky"" the fur will be about 1/2""-2"" long.  Choose ""Way Wacky"" and the fur will be 2"" and longer.) 
All Primal Kitty toys are individually made to order and ship 5-10 days after purchase. Each toy is a one-of-a-kind creation. Fur length, color and texture will vary.

7603,THIRD EYE Revival  ~Moon Goddess Magick~ Reawaken~ Pineal Gland Revival~ Third Eye Oil ~ Awakening oil ~ Psychic Oil~ Roll on Bottle 1/3oz,"
            Revive your Third Eye and see what is really meant to be seen~This Oil will speak for itself~ Containing Pure Essential Oils, Herbs and Quartz Crystal  used by Ancients in Sacred Rites and Ceremonies for centuries~ Some of the ingredients are Spikenard, used by the Ancient Egyptians to awaken the mind for ritual work, Frankincense, Anise, Bergamot, Eucalyptus,  Rosemary and Mugwort herbal infusion .. All used to stimulate the Mind and the Third Eye~ Blessed with herbs of Calendula and Blue Cornflower, and Quartz crystals to increase the Psychic visions~ 
♦Special Instructions♦
♦Use during Meditation while envisioning your Third eye becoming Awakened~ Sit in a quiet area with no disturbances~ relaxing music with flutes or harp sounds is recommended for complete relaxation~ Apply your oil to your Third Eye Chakra and massage in a circular motion~ Then Apply your oil to your left hand~ In esoteric philosophy the left hand receives psychic energy and the right hand puts it forth~ So, place your right hand upon your head while hold out your receiving left hand to welcome the knowledge~ You should be feeling a slight tingling feeling enter your third eye as well as your head where your right hand is placed~ be patient with this process and make this a daily practice until you begin to see the knowledge being given to you more clearly~  This is a process that should continue even when fully awake~ knowledge is never ending and should always be welcomed~  
♦From some people, I have received messages like ""My Third Eye didn't open"" or ""I Didn't experience anything"". My response to this is simple ~ Relax~   This process is not an overnight process. Awakening a clogged, clouded or even  totally shut off Third Eye takes time and Patience~ You will begin to FEEL connected to the Energy of the Earth, Spiritual Plane and the amazing Energy of your OWN Pineal Gland within the brain~ This gland is the key to becoming fully awakened and connected to our higher consciousness, also known as the Psychic Gland. When we become awakened we begin to see things more clearly through Feeling and thought~ We can begin to channel messages and hear also known as feel our guides and higher self more clearly~ So, relax, be patient and you will succeed at this ~ ♥

""Absolutely love this oil. Smells divine, I already know it will aid me very well in my late night revelations as well as the astral projecting part as I already had an unexpected and electricly vivid dream experience right after putting this on the surface of my third eye for the first time. Tingly! I also want to add that your bottle printing designs and the charms that go along with them are so pretty and well made. I very much appreciate the fact that you leave the herbs and crystals inside each bottle. Not only does it make them more potent as time goes on, but it also gives me that important, special relation with each potion and its delightful ingredients. It's almost a form of a bonding experience when the herbs and stones are actually present to communicate directly with. Senekiz""
♦Although I do put in Magical Intent for you, it is also required for you to place your intent into your oil as well~ Manifest your desire, feel the emotion connected to your intent as if it is already yours~ once you have accomplished this, set if free to the Universe~ It is important for you to know that I cannot guarantee your desired outcome, only you can Manifest it!  If you have a questions on how to do this, I would be happy to help~♦

.......................................Shipping Info...........................................
Shipping Info:
- We use as many recycled shipping materials that we possibly can when packaging your item to help insure that your item arrives to you safely, while reducing waste.
- All mugs being shipped in the continental US will be done through 2-3 day Priority Mail.
- All mugs being shipped outside the US will be shipped First Class international Mail. If you would like a faster international method please contact us for pricing.
...........................................FAQ.......................................................
- Why does shipping seem to cost so much? Can I Get Cheaper Shipping? These Prices are Redic!
Unfortunately shipping heavier items is a bit pricier. When you include the weight of the mug, the box, and the other protective shipping, we have no choice but to ship Priority Mail, and we do not make ANYTHING off shipping charges... BUT, the good news it, it is cheaper to ship more than one mug at a time, because we can often use flat rate shipping boxes! Please contact us if you have any questions.
- What is Double Sided Print?
Double sided print is when the image is printed on both sides of the mug. A standard print is the image printed on one side of the mug. (When the mug is held in the right hand, the image faces away from you).
- What is Standard Print?
Standard print is the cheaper of the print options, with the image printed on the right side. When you hold the mug in your hand, the image will face your audience, and away from you. When held with your left, your fans will see the blank side of the mug, while you see design.

Saint John's Wort Oil
This plant has been used as a herbal remedy for its anti-inflammatory and healing properties since the Middle Ages. Many ancient herbalists, including Hippocrates and Pliny, recorded the medicinal properties of St. John's wort. It was noted for its wound-healing and diuretic properties as well as for the treatment of back pain. Also the plant was used as a balm for burns. The oil of the plant, also, was popular during this time. An olive oil extract of the fresh flowers that acquires a reddish color has been applied externally to relieve inflammation and promote healing. Its topical application is believed to be particularly useful in the management of hemorrhoids. In Greece the plant is known as Spathohorto which means Sword Herb. The name came from the Spartans as they used it to heal the wounds caused from swords during battles. 
Weight: 5 oz (150 ml) or 2.90 oz (85 ml)
The Saint John's Wort used is wild harvested by us and extracted in organic extra virgin olive oil (from our very own olive trees).

4.  Purchase a ""RUSH ORDER"" if you need me to put a rush on your order in my shop (see above link)
_____________________________________________
GETTING THE RIGHT SIZE PATCH FOR YOUR TIE:
1.   I suggest you go with the 3.2"" wide patch IF YOU CAN as it makes it easier to embroider BUT IF unsure of tie width (at it's widest point) and can't measure the tie go with the 3"".  The decorative edging is included in the sizing.
2.  This patch is for a TRADITIONAL TIE and comes in your choice of 2 different heart sizes.  It is your responsibility to measure the tie it is going on.  
3.  The only way to be sure of fit is for you to measure the tie it is for.  Not all ties are created equal!  
4.  Keep in mind, the smaller the patch, the smaller the text has to be OR you can choose less text to keep same size text.
5.  Choose the size patch you want from the drop-down box along with whether it is sew-on or iron-on.
IS YOUR TIE LESS THAN 3"" (at it's widest point)?  Then you need a SKINNY TIE PATCH at this listing:

18511,"Engraved Bracelet, Personalized Bracelet, Custom Leather Bracelet, Laser Engraved Bracelet, Couples Gifts, Choose Your Text, Boyfriend Gift","
            This engraved bracelet would make a fun gift for yourself or a friend. The bracelet is laser engraved with the text of your choice (about 40 characters or so). You pick the font, color and size to make this bracelet just right for you. When you order, write the text you would like engraved in the 'notes to seller' box. The last photo shows our font options that you can pick from. 
** HOW TO PICK A SIZE**
Measure your wrist with a soft tape measure to the exact size you want the bracelet to fit when closed. We will add the additional amount needed for the snap closure. If you don't have a tape measure, you can use a piece of paper and then measure the paper with a ruler. 
We hand cut and dye each piece of leather to make these bracelets. They are made from quality vegetable tanned leather that produces a nice bracelet. We seal them with a clear conditioner/sealer to protect the leather and it is fastened with a metal snap closure. 
These bracelets are a half an inch wide and are custom made to the length you need. 
***Keep in mind when ordering, the color of the laser engraving is black, so the darker colors of leather will make it harder to see the engraving.***
Leather is a natural product and is subject to variations. This can affect how it absorbs the dyes. This can result in slight variations in color from the listing pictures. You will not be receiving the actual bracelet in the listing picture as yours will be handmade at the time of your order to your specific requests.

            Have your little one be stylish and comfortable with these moccasins. They are made from a soft and flexible vegan leather (composed of 85% polyester and 15% spandex). The vegan leather has a slight stretch to it which make it easy to put on. The elastic inside goes around babies ankle so they are less likely to be kicked off by your little one. The inside lining is made of a soft and comfortable fleece lining. These moccs are perfect for babies because the are soft and flexible like a pair of socks, and perfect for babies learning to walk because they are slip resistant. Even better, these moccs are machine washable! Turn these precious little shoes inside out and machine wash on gentle and lay flat to dry. 
 Please remember these are soft sole shoes and it is not recommended they be worn outside. This is a thinner vegan leather that allows baby to feel where she is walking and easy movement of the foot which is ideal for beginning walkers. 
Sizes are:
Newborn: 3 inches
size 1: 3.5 inches
size 2: 4 inches
size 3: 4.5 inches
size 4: 5 inches
***If you are ordering newborn size: please keep in mind that I make them this small to fit a baby immediately after birth. Newborns grow quickly, so if you want to use these for a bit longer please order a size 1 
**Please note that refunds will not be issued due to wrong size. Please measure child's foot before ordering. I do accept returns with the buyer paying return shipping. 
To correctly measure place the child's foot on a piece of paper and make a mark on the heel and big toe. Then measure between the two points. Additional space will be needed between toe and shoe so if the child's foot measures 4 inches please order the 4.5 inch size. Due to varying ankle sizes of babies the elastic sizing cannot be exact. Each size will have the same elastic size and if you need a specific elastic length please contact me.        ",14.95,4.7992,"Handmade item
