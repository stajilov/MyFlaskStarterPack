13,"Vintage R2-D2 Star Wars Action Figure Carrying Case and Playset with Rolling Destroyer Droid Figure - 12"" Tall with Battle Playset Inside","
            R2-D2 always got the job done. That's why he's the perfect choice to represent the Star Wars universe as an action figure carrying case / playset. Just pop open the latch to reveal a fully transformable battle station, ready for action! But don't let the rolling ""Destroyer Droid"" action figure get you! From the 1990's Kenner Star Wars toy line, the case itself measures approximately 12"" high and holds up to 10 Star Wars action figures
MAKE, MODEL & SPECS:
1990's Unopened Star Wars ""R2-D2"" Action Figure Carrying Case and Playset with rolling ""Destroyer Droid"" action figure. In its original, unopened store packaging. Holds up to 10 Star Wars action figures. Includes several opening and closing doors and secret compartments. Approximately 12"" tall and opens up to about 20"" wide.
All Star Wars toys and collectibles are from my personal collection and have been carefully stored in a smoke-free home.
CONDITION:
The pictures represent what the item will look like once it's opened up and displayed. However, the actual item you will receive is in its original, unopened packaging and in excellent, like new condition. Includes all original pieces, instructions and labels/decals.
THE FORCE IS WITH YOU, ALWAYS:
I do my very best to describe all collectibles as accurately as possible. However, please keep in mind that most items at Half Pint Salvage are intended for nostalgic purposes only. So if you're a serious collector and are looking for officially graded action figures, this may not be the best option for your needs.

802,Authentic Tuareg Fulani Earrings,"
            The gold that Fulani craftsmen used was one of many goods that passed through this once- thriving trade center. As the flow of goods slowed to a trickle once the Portuguese established trade ports along the coast, Fulani craftsmen adapted their skills to more easily acquired metals such a brass. Today the town of just under 40,000 people has an agrarian economy, but Fulani metal smiths and jewelers still ply their trade in Djenne's markets.

1446,"100 Antique Marbles, 1920's-1950's,  Peltier, Akro, Vitro, Master, Marble King, Etc.  Worth Hundreds of Dollars","
            This listing is for 100 old marbles, generally 5/8"" size.  Most of these will be from the late 1950's or older, some possibly back even to the 1800's.  Many, if not most of these will be in one or more of the various marble price guides for as much as 2 to 8 EACH!  That means that technically, in each lot you are getting several hundred dollars worth of marbles here.  However, they are common enough patterns the experienced collectors already have them and don't look at these.  So at shows I wholesale these out for 1 each and go through hundreds of them.  Home decorators and artists love these, as do children or beginning collectors, because they are so colorful and varied.  I've even had fellow marble dealers pick up a couple hundred at a time.
Just about anything could potentially show up here: Peltier baseballs, Akro corkscrews, Vitro tri-colors, dyed clays, Peltier Rainbo's, Marble King multi-colors, Master Made Sunbursts, Champion Jr.'s, unglazed chinas, Vitro Helmets, Banana-style and caged cat's eyes, slags, hybrid cat's eyes, older patches and brushed, Peltier sunsets, older All-Reds or Blackies, West Virginia swirls from a number of companies.....you get the idea.  Anything old might be found.
Pictures are just examples (plate not included).  I'll simply pick the next 100 marbles out of my bins.  Most will be mint or near mint condition, though in large lots like this you are bound to get an occasional chip or manufacturing flaw.
I'll drop the price down to 65 for each lot, multiple lots available.

1494,Antique Wooden Roller Skates - Leather Straps - Dated 1892,"
            These are wonderful old wooden roller skates with leather straps. They have patent dates on the base ranging from July 1890 to March 1892. They are in antique vintage condition and do have a few issues. The leather straps are somewhat brittle and hard. One skate has the complete set of straps with buckles but the other is missing part of the back strap.  The back straps are bent over and will not stand straight unless something is inserted to hold them in place. The wood has wonderful patina and the wheels all spin. There is the number 10 under the base. They are 10"" in length and are about 2 1/4"" wide at the heel. The wheels are 2"" in diameter. Please view all photos for more details of their condition. What a wonderful set for display!        ",65.00,4.9189,"Vintage item from the 1800s

            These wonderful navy blue slacks are in excellent vintage condition:  I can find no flaws except a barely discernible discolored area on the interior of the right pocket;  they look to have been rarely, if ever, worn.

4425,Vintage Vinyl QANTAS Airways Airlines Retro Souvenir Flight Tote Bag White Logo Zipper Travel Shoulder Cabin Bag Overnight Carry On Luggage,"
            Rare. Hard to find. Fabulous condition. NOT A REPRODUCTION. This is the real deal. This great bag was once filled with complimentary travel accessories for your international flight to/from Australia. The tote bag is in very good condition with some minor wear to the logos and bottom. 
Zipper pocket on the side for your passport and a second flat pocket to slide your documents in with ease. Two handles. Great tote for your next get away. Made of vinyl.  The bag has been cleaned with mild detergent and a Magic Eraser to remove most scuffs and soil.
The only trouble spot to note aside from wear was a manufacturing flaw - trim along zipper did not connect with the vinyl and appears to have happened at the time of manufacture. This is not a rip or a tear or a seam pull. The stitching never made contact with the vinyl when it was originally sewn. A quick and easy fix with a bit of glue would do the trick! 
Red, white and blue color scheme. The red cord is knotted and held by silver grommets. The red piping around the bag is in good condition. The bottom does not have feet.  The bag measures: 15 H x 12W x 6D

4513,"Canvas bank deposit money bag, canvas bank bag, vintage night deposit canvas money bag with lock","
            Vintage canvas bank deposit bag
The bag can be dated 1960's because according to my research, the company name was changed to A. Rifkin & CO. and in 1972 the look was changed from the Arcolock to the #7 lock in order to provide a more secure lock.
The lock on this bag is marked A Rikin and Co. and is an Arcolock.
Made of canvas, the bag is from the Haverhill National Bank in Haverhill, Massachusetts. It measures 10 x 7 inches. The zipper works fine, the lock has signs of age with scuffs, scratches and some patina. I do not have a key.
The bag itself has signs of age with some fading and discoloring with no rips or tears. Also there are some scuffs on the leather patch by the lock.
I believe this would make a really great purse but I just do not have the energy in this time in life to do this and I probably will regret it.

She is in excellent condition with the exception of 4 tiny nicks on the flowers.  So minor it is very, very difficult to see and in no way detracts from the beauty and intricate detail of this wonderful piece.  Check the flowers in picture number 3.   The very reasonable price for this piece more than compensates for the minor tiny nicks.  Introduced in 1974 retired in 1995.  Sculpted by Francisco Catala, it measures 8 3/4 inches high.

5268,17thc Nicholas Dorigny Antique portrait 1684 head study sanguine drawing antique bearded man,"
            Antique portrait European School 18th/ 19th-century head study of a bearded man in profile,
 
Possibly by Nicholas Dorigny (French, born circa 1657–1746)
Sanguine drawing
 
A rather fabulous antique drawing which I bought years ago (I'm currently selling some of my personal items). I love the colour & quality of the drawing, in particular, the cross hatching & the wavy lines depicting the hair. Indistinct signature on laid paper, unidentified watermark, but I have been informed by a very helpful Etsy person that it probably dates to 1684 & is by the artist Nicholas Dorigny.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Dorigny 
"" In 1711 he was invited to England by Queen Anne to engrave the Cartoons of Raphael at Hampton Court, which he finished in 1719, and in the following year he was knighted by King George I. While he was in England he painted some portraits of the nobility, but with no great success. He returned to France in 1725, and was received into the Academy in the same year. He exhibited some pictures of sacred subjects at the Salon from 1739 to 1743, and died in Paris in 1746""  
SIZE: approx 42 x 35 cm  
CONDITION: Good overall antique condition commensurate with age, there is a small tear on the right edge also a smaller one on the left edge & 2 very small areas of damage on the top edge. 
POSTAGE: insured & trackable, postage is high due to  insurance value but if there is any excess will be refunded & I also will combine postage where possible across my sites. It will be sent flat using tracked or signed for postage. Postage cost is for shipping and does not include duties or taxes which as usual are the buyers responsibility to pay. Non-returnable

Alive with detail, it catches your eye as you walk by it. The flower blossoms are lovely, with subtle color changes and delicate brush strokes. The effect is interestingly complex and very beautiful. This oil painting is classic and timeless in composition.  It has a wonderful captivating glow.  The painting is on stretched canvas. This gem is in excellent condition and is signed by artist Russo in lower corner.   The oil painting size is 12"" X 16"", and the overall wooden frame size is 17"" X 21"".   This work of art is from the 1970's.   The woman that I bought it from said that she bought it 45 years ago.  There are no major flaws or marks on the painting.  It has one very small dimple that cannot be seen even up close, when viewing the painting.   You only can see it from the back of the canvas, therefore the overall beauty of this painting is not effected.   There are no rubs in the paint and the colors are vibrant. The pink wooden frame is in great vintage condition.  It sets off the painting nicely and compliments the colors. This is a very lovely and delicate original vintage oil painting, which is classic and beautiful. It would captivate any room in your home with a touch of floral beauty. It would blend with traditional, contemporary or shabby chic decors.   Please view all the photos.  🌸🌸🌸

6000,"Pet Revolution™ 16"" Ultra Silent Deluxe Chinchilla Wheel, Free Organic Special Treat with every purchase!","
            ***Very proud Buffalo Mtn Curios was named #75 out of top 100 Etsy Pet Sellers! What an honor! <3 We work very hard to give you quality products for your furbabies. :) <3***
*New and Improved! Brand new roller blade wheels are in! They are bigger and better to ensure even more longevity of your lil one's wheel!*
Every order comes with a special treat for your furbaby! Organic chew sticks from the awesome Cherokee Forest Woods Co! They are a great local company, the only place we trust for our chin's treats! <3 <3 
The absolute BEST Chinchilla wheel you will find! I painstakingly designed the most QUIET and SAFEST Chinchilla exercise wheel that I could and after a lot of trial and error this is my final result. We tried just about every other wheel out there from 10 name brand to overpriced ""silent"" plastic wheels, flying saucer and even the top of line spinner wheel. They all had one quirk or another that we didn't like, usually they sounded like a small freight train was barreling through the house! 
Width of pan is just shy of 4"".
The wheel itself is made from rolled galvanized steel which will be sturdy and will not rust or corrode, The bearing is a sealed bearing which is designed for high r.p.m, high speed applications so it requires no grease or oil and will last for years. All of the mounting hardware is pure 18-8 stainless steel so NO RUST!! We only get the best, top quality stainless steel hardware.
On the back of the pan is 2 galvanized mounting brace plates securely installed to provide superior stability as compared to any other wheel handmade or commercially available. The plates eliminate the possibility of any ""flex"" in the wheel or on the cage which will prolong the life of the wheel as well as your cage. 
We have also tried to minimize the space between the cage and the wheel itself, so the chin can not get trapped. We have also made this wheel as lightweight as physically possible! This wheel will NOT break your Ferret Nation cages because of weight issues!
Disclaimers: These pans do come with a sticky coating from the factory for their protection. My husband carefully cleans each pan to get most of it off, as a tiny little bit does have to stay on to protect the metal. So do not be alarmed if you happen to feel anything when inspecting carefully. <3
Also, please be aware that if you are putting the wheel on a bottom floor, where they can pee down on it, an easy solution would be to put a ledge above the mechanism. Animals constantly peeing onto the bearing could cause it to gunk up and start to make noise.
We also found a great solution to those flimsy cages. If you take a solid piece of wood or metal and place it the width of the cage (from corner to corner) that will help stabilize your wheel! We can always make one for you if you are unable to. :)
:D Happy running! :D
We can also accommodate all your custom hammock, tube and ledge needs! Just message us! We look forward to serving you. <3        ",51.99,4.974,"Handmade item

            Large Guinea Pig Cage Mat is a washable, reversible, absorbent pad/liner featuring an absorbent layer between two layers of premium fleece.  This listing is for one flat pad that covers the bottom of the cage only and is super-easy to maintain.  This LARGE pad is apx 24 by 48 inches.  It is reversible.  You choose if you want a print on one side and solid on the other or both sides the same.  And of course I can make it in your sweet piggy's choice of colors.   (Just let me know in your comment.)  
Check my shop for other sizes!  
It will withstand hundreds of washings.  Colorful and stimulating, these layers are quilted together to prevent bunching when sweeping poops.  Keeps all droppings on the surface for easy clean up!
Simply sweep up poops daily.  
Your piggy will LOVE the soft & dry surface and it is reversible for two great looks!  Your sweet piggies will show their delight by pop-corning, running laps, and sprawling out on their liner!
(Although I have washed the fleece used for this pad, I recommend you wash your new piggy pad prior to its initial use to insure proper wicking.  Machine wash your piggy pad in warm or cold water using laundry detergent that does not contain fabric softener.  Fabric softener will cause your fleece pad to stop wicking the urine away from the surface and into the middle absorbent layer.  Let your piggy pad air dry to insure the wicking of the fleece fabric.)

8616,Abundance - Fertility Goddess Statue Doula Midwife Gift Figurine Goddess Sculpture Pagan Buddhist Altar Birth Art Blessingway Womb blessing,"
            Abundance -Fertility Goddess Statue Doula Midwife Gift Mother Earth Sculpture Pagan Buddhist Altar Birth Art Blessingway Womb blessing
The theme fertility is common to all cultures of the world. Inspired by the goddess of fertility, these pieces are steeped Symbolism. A feminine figure representing this theme - either sculpted in wood or clay - was always paid homage no matter the culture in question. It is only in our western world that we forget to honour the feminine principle as cultures of old did. This principle was honoured for its influence over aspects such as arable land, vegetation, creativity, family, health, wealth and abundance. By focusing on the Symbolism of the sculpture, tribal members were able to manifest fertility in their own lives.
My reproduction Abundance sculptures are created from my original, hand cast and hand finished in my studio. They are filled with this Symbolism, created with me paying homage to this principle long forgotten in our modern society.
A beautiful gift for a doula / midwife, or as symbolism for bringing Abundance into your life.

♦ Condition:                              as is 
Because these are vintage estate pieces and are vintage and possibly pre-worn so they are not considered new from the factory…..  Please see photos for any wear or light surface scratches that come with age.☺………………. Sold as is and priced accordingly..  All cufflinks ( unless otherwise specified)  are considered costume jewelry. We don’t polish these previously owned well loved pieces so we can keep the original patina. We try and photograph all of the pieces next to a ruler so you can see the actual size. All jewelry sold as found.
We use the descriptions of any stones from the manufacturers titles when they were first produced. When we refer to the stones as moonstone or jade or garnet, for example, we are using how the original manufacturer of the pieces used them. We cannot guarantee the authenticity of a stone in a costume piece of jewelry. All pieces have been worn at least one time unless otherwise specified.  Although the pieces we carry are unique and interesting they may have a little wear ( if any) but they sure have a lot of love that came with them when they were first purchased way back when.
Just click on our photos for more close ups to help you see all the cool detail on each piece.

10074,D&D Gaming Dice Box - Cthulhu H. P. Lovecraft - Dungeons and Dragons Dice Box - Personalized Rpg Dice Box - Mtg Tcg or Tabletop Gaming,"
            Inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's Mythos, this D&D gaming Dice Box features the fearsome Cthulhu to store and protect your Dungeons and Dragons RPG Dice.
This little box in particular is designed to hold your dice, and if you've purchased one of our wooden deck boxes, they match perfectly! They easily fit a full set of 7 dice, plus a little extra wiggle room for one or two more.
We also have a slightly larger size that will allow you to triple the amount that can be stored.
Every box has a small strip of magnet that will help keep your slide lid closed when not in use. Each box also has the track that the slide rides on waxed
__________
**Important**
By default this deck comes with two different size options available at purchase.
Default Size: This size will hold approximately a full ""set"" of dice (D4, D6, D8, D10, %D10, D12, D20) plus at least 2 extra D20.
Taller Size: This size will hold roughly triple the amount of the default size.
NOTE: The amount of dice this box will actually hold will depend on the sizing of dice you use (If you use larger than average dice, it will hold less. If you use smaller than average dice it will hold more), AND what type of dice you're storing. (For instance, each box will hold a much greater amount of it's filled with only four sided dice.)
Each design is adjusted slightly for larger sizes, so you may notice a difference in the design as the sizes go up, but the overall aesthetic stays the same.
The dice pictured are not included in your purchase.
___________
How It's Made
The wood used is our wood of choice, Cherry Wood. Chosen for its sturdy durability while remaining easy for our machine to work with, as well as its gorgeous subtle red and golden luster when finished. Each product after engraving and cutting is sanded by hand to ensure the surface is smooth, then sealed with a clear varnish.
This listing is made to order, which means that you can expect from 3-10 business days for your order to be shipped.

Customization
We're always happy to customize a listing any way you choose. Either send us a message or click ""Request a custom order and have something made just for you."" just above this listing's description to begin creating a custom order with us. The price of custom orders will depend on the complexity of the changes.
What sort of things can you customize? Anything! Want an image changed? Want more custom text options on other locations on the box? All of these are perfectly acceptable. For instance, if you'd rather have a flying spaghetti monster instead of a Chibi Cthulhu that's totally doable.        ",27.95,4.9402,"Handmade item

10605,"Guatemalan embroidered, leather guitar strap, Gift guitarist, Electric guitar strap, Acoustic guitar strap, Jazz Rock Blues- Jardin Red JDG3","
            Handcrafted in the western highlands of Guatemala, this guitar strap is a fusion of traditional embroidery with contemporary design.  The originality, beauty, uniqueness, and exceptional handiwork is a product of six small, local family businesses who take great pride in their artistry.  Thanks to the human hands involved in each piece, all Tilde (till-day) straps are made to be original...no two can be exactly alike. 
Strap Length: up to 60 inches (152 cm)
Strap Width: approx. 2 inches (5cm)
Button/Pin Hole: 6mm with 10 mm slit
The strap is brand new, so just like most leather products it will take a few weeks to ""soften"" the new leather. We suggest the most natural, just-use-it, method rather than applying chemical softeners. From testimonials by musicians it take about 3-4 weeks of steady use (4 or 5 times a week).
Tilde Straps are a great holiday or birthday gift for the musician in your life. Check out our shop to find the perfect design and color strap! 
http://www.etsy.com/shop/TildeStraps
Quick notes:
-Just a little reminder leather is a natural fabric so there may be some variation in the texture, these imperfections contribute to the character of the strap without hindering the quality...we make sure of that.
-Is this for an acoustic guitar? We have extra long pieces of leather we can include in the package for you to tie the front end of the strap to the guitar neck. Please leave us a note with this request when you check out!
-DO YOU LIVE OUTSIDE THE U.S.? We recommend you use the following link *before you purchase* to see if your country will charge additional import fees: http://www.dutycalculator.com/country-guides/.        ",65.00,4.9385,"Handmade item

Store in the jewelry box with the tarnish resident tab that is provided with your order. 
The process: I start out with a handmade hammered ring, which gives the copper a lot of texture. I attach the stone to the ring, then sand the mounting to get the shape I want. The ring then goes through a really neat process called electroforming, where copper deposits onto the ring and around the base of the stone for about 12 hours. After waxing, sanding, and darkening the copper with a rich patina, the ring is finally complete! Long story short... a whole lot of time and love is put into this little beauty!

Edgar Rice Burroughs
was an American writer, best known for his creations of the jungle hero Tarzan and the heroic Mars adventurer John Carter, although he produced works in many genres.
Burroughs was born on September 1, 1875, in Chicago, Illinois (he later lived for many years in the suburb of Oak Park), the fourth son of businessman and Civil War veteran Major George Tyler Burroughs (1833–1913) and his wife Mary Evaline (Zieger) Burroughs (1840–1920). His middle name is from his paternal grandmother, Mary Rice Burroughs (1802–ca. 70).
Burroughs was educated at a number of local schools, and during the Chicago influenza epidemic in 1891, he spent a half year at his brother's ranch on the Raft River in Idaho. He then attended the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and then the Michigan Military Academy. Graduating in 1895, and failing the entrance exam for the United States Military Academy (West Point), he ended up as an enlisted soldier with the 7th U.S. Cavalry in Fort Grant, Arizona Territory. After being diagnosed with a heart problem and thus ineligible to serve, he was discharged in 1897.
After his discharge, Burroughs worked a number of different jobs. He drifted and worked on a ranch in Idaho. Then, Burroughs found work at his father's firm in 1899. He married his childhood sweetheart Emma Hulbert (1876-1944) in January 1900. In 1904, he left his job and worked less regularly, first in Idaho, then in Chicago.
By 1911, after seven years of low wages, he was working as a pencil sharpener wholesaler and began to write fiction. By this time, Burroughs and Emma had two children, Joan (1908–72), who would later marry Tarzan film actor James Pierce, and Hulbert (1909–91). During this period, he had copious spare time and he began reading many pulp fiction magazines. In 1929 he recalled thinking that
...if people were paid for writing rot such as I read in some of those magazines, that I could write stories just as rotten. As a matter of fact, although I had never written a story, I knew absolutely that I could write stories just as entertaining and probably a whole lot more so than any I chanced to read in those magazines.
Burroughs divorced Emma in 1934, and in 1935 he married former actress Florence Gilbert Dearholt, the former wife of his friend, Ashton Dearholt. Burroughs adopting the Dearholts' two children. He and Florence divorced in 1942.
Burroughs was in his late 60s and a resident of Hawaii at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Despite his age, he applied for and received permission to become a war correspondent, becoming one of the oldest U.S. war correspondents during World War II. This period of his life is mentioned in William Brinkley's bestselling novel Don't Go Near the Water.
TARZAN
is a fictional character, an archetypal feral child raised in the African jungles by the Mangani great apes; he later experiences civilization only to largely reject it and return to the wild as a heroic adventurer. Created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan first appeared in the novel Tarzan of the Apes (magazine publication 1912, book publication 1914), and subsequently in twenty-five sequels, three authorized books by other authors, and innumerable works in other media, both authorized and unauthorized.
Burroughs created an extreme example of a noble savage figure largely unalloyed with character flaws or faults. He is described as being Caucasian, extremely athletic, tall, handsome, and tanned, with grey eyes and long black hair. Emotionally, he is courageous, intelligent, loyal, and steadfast. He is presented as behaving ethically in most situations, except when seeking vengeance under the motivation of grief, as when his ape mother Kala is killed in Tarzan of the Apes, or when he believes Jane has been murdered in Tarzan the Untamed. He is deeply in love with his wife and totally devoted to her; in numerous situations where other women express their attraction to him, Tarzan politely but firmly declines their attentions. When presented with a situation where a weaker individual or party is being preyed upon by a stronger foe, Tarzan invariably takes the side of the weaker party. In dealing with other men, Tarzan is firm and forceful. With male friends, he is reserved but deeply loyal and generous. As a host, he is likewise, generous, and gracious. As a leader, he commands devoted loyalty.
In keeping with these noble characteristics, Tarzan's philosophy embraces an extreme form of ""return to nature"". Although he is able to pass within society as a civilized individual, he prefers to ""strip off the thin veneer of civilization"", as Burroughs often puts it. His preferred dress is a knife and a loincloth of animal hide, his preferred abode is any convenient tree branch when he desires to sleep, and his favored food is raw meat, killed by himself; even better if he is able to bury it a week so that putrefaction has had a chance to tenderize it a bit.
Tarzan's primitivist philosophy was absorbed by countless fans, amongst whom was Jane Goodall, who describes the Tarzan series as having a major influence on her childhood. She states that she felt she would be a much better spouse for Tarzan than his fictional wife, Jane, and that when she first began to live among and study the chimpanzees she was fulfilling her childhood dream of living among the great apes just as Tarzan did.
Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli has been cited as a major influence on Edgar Rice Burroughs' creation of Tarzan. Mowgli was also an influence for a number of other ""wild boy"" characters.
BURNE HOGARTH
was born in Chicago in 1911, the son of a housewife and a carpenter. His parents were immigrants from Eastern Europe. He displayed an early talent for drawing. His father saved these efforts and, some years later, presented them and the young Hogarth to the registrar at the Art Institute of Chicago. At age 12, Hogarth was admitted, thus embarking on a long formal education that took him through such institutions as Chicago's Crane College and Northwestern University, and New York City's Columbia University in New York City -- all the while, studying arts and sciences.
Due to his father’s premature death, Hogarth began work at age 15, when he became the assistant at the Associated Editors Syndicate and illustrated a series called Famous Churches of the World. He worked for several years as an editor and advertising artist. This work provided steady (and, by 1929, crucial) employment. In 1929, he drew his first comic strip, Ivy Hemmanhaw, for the Barnet Brown Company; in 1930 he drew Odd Occupations and Strange Accidents for Ledd Features Syndicate.
As the Great Depression worsened, Hogarth relocated to New York City at the urging of friends. He found employment with King Features Syndicate in 1934, drawing Charles Driscoll’s pirate adventure Pieces of Eight (1935). In 1936 came the assignment that catapulted Hogarth’s illustration career. With Tarzan, Hogarth brought together classicism, expressionism and narrative into a new form of dynamic, sequential art: the newspaper comic strip. Hogarth drew the Tarzan ""Sunday (newspaper comic strip) page"" for 12 years (1937–45; 1947–50). This work has been reprinted often, most recently by NBM Publishing.
TARZAN COMIC STRIPS
Tarzan of the Apes was adapted in newspaper strip form, in early 1929, with illustrations by Hal Foster. A full page Sunday strip began March 15, 1931 by Rex Maxon. Over the years, many artists have drawn the Tarzan comic strip, notably Burne Hogarth, Russ Manning, and Mike Grell. The daily strip began to reprint old dailies after the last Russ Manning daily (#10,308, which ran on 29 July 1972). The Sunday strip also turned to reprints circa 2000. Both strips continue as reprints today in a few newspapers and in Comics Revue magazine. NBM Publishing did a high quality reprint series of the Foster and Hogarth work on Tarzan in a series of hardback and paperback reprints in the 1990s.

11639,"The tales of Beedle the bard - facsimile, reproduction ITALIAN VERSION","
            The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a book of children's stories by British author J. K. Rowling. It purports to be the storybook of the same name mentioned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
The book was originally produced in a limited edition of only seven copies, each handwritten and illustrated by J. K. Rowling.[3] One of them was offered for auction through Sotheby's in late 2007 and was expected to sell for £50,000.
It is described as a popular collection of Wizarding children's fairy tales, so that while Ron Weasley is familiar with the stories, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had not previously heard of them due to their non-magical upbringing.
Rowling wrote five stories for the book. One, ""The Warlock's Hairy Heart"", is not mentioned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; three others, ""The Wizard and the Hopping Pot"", ""The Fountain of Fair Fortune"", and ""Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump"", receive cursory attention ""The Tale of the Three Brothers"" is the only story also included entirely in The Deathly Hallows

11697,"Rainer Maria Rilke, Poems,  limited edition handmade book","
            One of the most widely read and translated poets, the highly gifted and deeply spiritual Austrian/Czech poet Rainer Maria Rilke is often described as a “poet’s poet,” whose intense, introspective work influenced such fellow poets as Wallace Stevens, E. E. Cummings, Theodore Roethke, Randall Jarrell, Stephan Mitchell, and Robert Bly. 
Considered one of most significant literary figures of the early twentieth century, the first translations of Rilke began appearing in American newspapers as early as 1914, with the first book collection of his poems, translated by Jessie Lamont, published in 1918. This is a limited edition of the compete Lamont text, Rainer Maria Rilke: Poems, with the original introduction and a selection of the poet’s best known works, including: “Autumn,” “Moonlight Night,” “The Panther,” “I Live My Life in Circles,” and “Offering.” 
A handmade book, limited to a numbered edition of fifty, the text is set in Weiss with titles in Wellsbrook Initials. Pages and endpapers are printed on 80 lb. Mohawk Superfine Text. The book has a hand-sewn linen binding, ribbon bookmark, cover of Japanese book cloth over boards and tipped-in title plate.

            This beautiful faux fur wrap is so stunning! Perfect for a winter wedding! Also great for an outdoor wedding any time of year. Perfect accent for any formal or special event or date night. It will keep the chill off your shoulders when the sun goes down. Double sided fur feels incredibly soft against your skin.
I am in love this faux fur. It is the very softest faux fur that you can imagine. As soft as a bunny rabbit. The color is a gorgeous  eggplant purple! It is very lightweight so you won't feel like you are lugging around a big heavy coat but it will keep you warm while looking incredible! 
A Beautiful Bridal Stole or for a Bride or a Bridesmaid or Mother of the Bride or Mother of the Groom. Looks wonderful with an ivory or cream colored dress!  Also great with a white or blush dress and of coarse with a black dress it would be stunning! After the big day it can be worn again for a night out on the town!
Sample swatch available.
Measures 15"" x 70"".  So yummy to wrap around you and pin with a beautiful vintage brooch. (sold separately)
For Bridal party orders please check my shop for more beautiful colors!

14027,"Wooden Fountain Pen handmade In c5000 yr old Irish Bog Oak. Perfect Gift For Any Occasion: Birthday, St Patrick's Day, Fathers Day, etc.","
            This handmade wooden fountain pen would make a perfect gift for any occasion. It has a traditional style reminiscent of the 'Gentleman's' pens of days gone by. It is finished in Irish Bog Oak wood with 24ct gold fittings. Similar wood recovered from peat bogs has been carbon dated at between 3000 & 5000 years old. I have finished it with a blend of waxes and polishes to give a durable and long lasting protection making it suitable for daily use.
ABOUT THIS PEN:
- Features a medium/firm German made nib.
- Perfectly balanced for an exceptional writing experience.
- The pen (without cap) measures approx 5"" (13 1/2 cm) long and 3/4"" (2cm) at it's widest.
- This is a non-posted fountain pen (i.e. the cap is kept separate from the barrel while the pen is in use),
- This pen will come with a refillable ink piston as well as five ink cartridges in either blue or black.
- This would make a perfect gift for any occasion.
- The pen will come with guidance on use, care and storage.
- All of my pens and pencils are individually hand made. Each one is completely unique.
- Notebooks similar to the one shown can be seen at www.tanglecrafts.etsy.com 
 
DELIVERY:
I aim to post all orders the next working day.
These are Royal Mail's guidelines on delivery times:
- UK orders are generally delivered the next working day,
- overseas orders are generally delivered within 7-10 working days after postage , but can sometimes take a little longer.
I recommend that all buyers use the Shipping Upgrade Option to take advantage of the tracking facility provided by Royal Mail. Once an item is posted, I cannot be held responsible for any loss/damage/delays in post.
Customers outside the UK please check the import restrictions for your country before ordering as you may be liable for import duties/taxes etc.
CUSTOM ORDERS:
I am happy to accept custom orders. I keep a variety of timber on hand, so if you like these pens, but not this wood, why not have one specially made just for you in your own choice of timber? Or, perhaps you have own special piece of wood that you'd like a pen or pencil made from? Feel free to get in touch with me to chat about your requirements.        ",65.00,5.0,"Handmade item

15012,Merino Bamboo Combed Top Blend - Hand Painted Wool Roving - Hand Dyed for Spinning or Felting - 4 oz,"
            What a great combination of fibers! The soft merino takes up all the dye while the bamboo remains undyed and with a pretty luster, very similar to silk. Both fibers complement each other pretty well. The merino also adds softness and memory and the bamboo adds strength and pretty streaks through the wool.  Great fiber for felting.

Merino 60%
Bamboo 40%

113 grams
All my fiber comes from a smoke-free, pet-free environment.
I used to store my fibers with lavender sachets, but I don't anymore as I have learned that moths hates disturbances and some people are allergic to lavender. Now I dust and clean more frequently and move things around but I still include a lavender sachet with each order, unless someone requests me not to. If you don't want the lavender because you are allergic or for some other reason, let me know on the comment section, or send me a message.
I do my best to get pictures from different angles to capture and show the color combinations. Remember that your monitor may show colors different than mine. I'm always open for questions.

            Do you live for makeup? Always check others 'brow game'? Well then you need some sparklicious makeup brushes added to your collection. 
These crystal encrusted makeup brushes are sure to add some sparkle to your day as you get all dolled up! If you would like different colors- no problem!  I have a wide variety of stones. I'm sure we can find one (or two) to fit your personality! 
I attach my crystal with a very strong adhesive that should last and last. If stones get dirty (from all that makeup!) just wipe clean with a damp cloth. Do not submerge in water as it COULD loosen the adhesive.   
Before purchasing, note that these to-die-for brushes are not eligible for returns, refunds or exchanges (due to hygiene reasons) and that while I try to get your orders to you super quick, you should allow 3-5 business days for processing. 
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me and I’ll be happy to talk you through the ordering process, answering any questions you might have along the way.

• IMPORTANT READ ABOUT: Our Strict Disclaimer And Design Limitations Regarding Industry Standard Woven Labels.
This is industry standard for woven labels. With weaving, it is impossible to have 100% detail to match your graphic art, as these are literally stitched/woven labels and NOT printed labels.  
The size after cut and folded finished both have -2mm tolerances. The colors of yarn can have tolerances of up to15%.   please note that vertical line, horizontal line  circles, curves and slants are very tough with weaving, it will have a step to the next stitch line in the weaving process. Also, some letters may be larger, etc.   
If you need 100% matching of fine detail, no color of yarn ""peeking"" through a white background from yarn, you need printed labels instead of premium woven. The yarn/threads of woven labels may have different thicknesses hence limitations to some fine detail. By ordering woven labels you understand and agree with these industry standard tolerances and are approved by you the customer upon placing this order. The method of weaving labels involves moving parts and moving loom machinery and therefore the possibility of the above variances These are NOT printed labels!  While we try our best to avoid any tolerance, these tolerances above are industry standard for all woven labels.        ",65.00,4.9051,"Handmade item

Store in the jewelry box with the tarnish resident tab that is provided with your order. 
The process: I start out with a handmade hammered ring, which gives the copper a lot of texture. I attach the stones to the ring, then sand the mounting to get the shape I want. The ring then goes through a really neat process called electroforming, where copper deposits onto the ring and around the base of the stones for about 12 hours. After waxing, sanding, and darkening the copper with a rich patina, the ring is finally complete! Long story short... a whole lot of time and love is put into this little beauty!

            GALAXY RING
These universe inspired rings were created using charcoal to represent black space, while using various colours of glitter and goldstone dust to represent stars, and pieces of amethyst clusters to represent solar systems placed throughout an entire eco-epoxy resin ring.
SYMBOLIC MEANING
Within the Universe exists all matter and space as we know; life and energy flowing as one. These rings symbolize the mystery, and vastness of our beautiful universe. Endless possibilities exist here where nothing is separate or disconnected. Galaxies, solar systems, stars, planets, events in time. Every instance you have ever thought of exists somewhere, and occurrences you could never imagine have their place also in the cosmos. 
Each crystal, plant, and ring is collected upon purchase, and is uniquely made for you. These pictures are only examples as each ring is made to order and different in their own way.
AVAILABILITY AND SIZES
This style of ring can be made all year round in sizes 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. The chain can be included if specified at time of purchase.
SIZING DETAILS
These rings are extremely lightweight. 
Please refer to this image for reference to ring dimensions for further understanding of this next segment.

            Vintage Alden Scotch Grain Pebble Grain Brown Longwing Wingtip Blucher Shoes. Size 8 1/2 AA/B
 For your consideration we have a great pair of shoes from the 1980s. Made by Alden, these shoes are done in a Scotch/Pebble grain brown leather and are cut in the longwing/ gunboat wingtip style. They have leather soles and rubber foot balance curved orthopedic heels. These have some miles on them and will eventually need a resole and a good cleaning and shine from a professional. Otherwise, these are in perfectly useable shape and would look great with gray flannels, navy worsted suit, dark denim, or cords/moleskin pants. A very versatile shoe, indeed.

Marked Size- 8 1/2 AA/B (Narrow)
Length Toe to Heel- 11 1/2""

            Toddler Boots in Red leather with black double suede soles for toddler sizes. These leather baby & toddler boots are very sturdy & are suitable to wear indoors or outdoors.**PLEASE measure your child's feet before ordering.
I have now added a 4 extra Toughtek Soling option when purchasing boots. (Black colour only at this stage).
Toughtek is an abrasion and water resistant leather-like grip fabric made of 100% polyester backing with a rubber coating. This soling is glued onto the outside of existing suede sole then stitched onto the boots. It is very soft and flexible for first walkers and more importantly non-slip in wet, dry and cold conditions.
NEW!! Please click here to add lambswool insert to your toddler boots order.

SELECTING THE PERFECT BOOT SIZE:
* Please trace around your child's foot on paper whilst on a firm surface, then measure your drawing from big toe to heel.
* Add up to 1cm in length longer than your measurement to allow for growth. Even though your toddler may be turning 12 months, we have found in numerous cases the 8-12 months size has been adequate.
