220,Personalised Leather Tag,"
            These custom leather tags are great for adding a personal touch to your gift wrap or for use as luggage tags. They will make excellent gifts for newly weds, family and friends. 
You are able to choose from tan, black and brown. Customise your tags how you like but as little text as possible is advised! There is room for three rows, each with a 12 character limit (including spaces!) this will all be in CAPS. I have the symbols  - . ' & "" and also numbers and coordinate symbols. Just leave me a message in the box provided at checkout of what you would like.
The leather has been treated with a finishing cream that contains wax compounds that gives the leather a natural shine. The edges have been burnished with beeswax for a high quality finish. Comes with a length of leather cord on each tag for tying.
Tag measures 85 x 50 mm
*Please note that every item is made to order and completely unique each time. The end product that you receive may be slightly different from the pictures listed due to the natural qualities in the leather.*

4367,Leather Presentation Portfolio,"
            Leather presentation portfolio.   This is for the man or woman with confidence who only needs the important papers and presentation products for the meeting.  
Nice soft color for the hard sell.
Portfolio opens completely when unzipped.  There is one pocket on each side inside the bag.  Case 11"" tall x 15.5"" wide.
The zipper and stitching are heavy, yet doesn't distract from the bag's simple elegance.  
This bag was once owned by a WWII veteran - a man of taste and curiosity for all things electronic and mechanical.  I think there may be some serious MOJO that comes with this bag.

*Due to the nature of vintage linens, some minor signs of aging may be present. Any notable damages/staining/fraying/age spots are stated in listing descriptions. As a rule, I do not prewash handkerchiefs, nor do I list any that do not appear to be clean and fresh. I carefully iron all linens. I've found that spot cleaning with delicate soaps can work very well.  If not washed carefully, the colors can be less vivid and the texture can be less fresh.  If you are not pleased, you may return for item credit within 7 days.  I love vintage linens and want you to be happy as well.        ",12.95,5.0,"Vintage item

7920,BEST SELLING Vintage Nixie Clock - Art Deco design with Nixie tubes made in the Cold War Era - Wooden enclosure handcrafted by Nuvitron,"
            ༶ -- THE VINTAGE NIXIE TUBE CLOCK  -- ༶
With brand new, unused Nixie tubes that were rescued from exile in long abandoned basements in Eastern Europe, the Vintage Nixie Tube Clock imparts a warm glow from within its beautiful, handmade, Art Deco enclosure. Each clock casing takes over 30 hours to create and a lifetime to admire.
This Vintage Nixie Tube Clock is handcrafted using new old-stock tubes. These Nixie tubes are at least 30 years old, have never been used before and come from the former Soviet Union. Old school technology combined with an art deco style in a fine wooden handmade enclosure.
Bring to your home a piece of history with The Vintage Nixie Tube Clock and its Cold War era components.  The soft and warm glow of the Nixie tubes makes it perfect to use it in your bedroom. It won't disturb your sleep.
We guarantee the Vintage Nixie Tube Clock  to be free of material imperfections, and will replace for free any tubes that fail in the first two years after your purchase. Nixie tubes are known to last for decades, and ours operate in a range far below their peak, this ensures you will enjoy them for a long time.  
༶ -- FEATURES  -- ༶
༶ We extend the Nixies lifespan by turning on all the numbers evenly. You will see a random number effect each time a minute passes and a slot machine effect once each ten minutes.
༶ The brightness of your clock will start at a medium level. You can increase or decrease the brightness level if needed.
༶ Color LED´s behind the Nixie tubes will help you set the clock, the alarm and will have decorative effects that you can disable if desired.
༶ You can display time on 12 or 24 hours format as well as using the alarm mode to wake you up with a vintage style.
༶ The Vintage Nixie Tube Clock was designed to work below its operation point to ensure the tubes last longer. 
༶ Nixie tubes are neither soldered nor tightly fixed to the circuit board, but rather they can be easily swapable, provided that they’re held in place using copper pin connectors. In fact, our IN-12 Nixie Tubes are very common and easily available online.
༶ The clock can work flawlessly in the 5 continents because it accepts 110V and 220V in both frequencies, 50 and 60 Hz.
༶ -- RETRO TECHNOLOGY FROM THE COLD WAR ERA  -- ༶
Nixie tubes lie at the heart of our Nixie tube clocks and also give it them its name. The tubes were manufactured decades ago in the former Soviet Union, with the intention of being used in military equipment for purposes that are probably best left untold.
Each Nixie tube included in this clock contains 10 electrodes (one for each digit) made out of Molybdenum, and separated by ceramic rings. Everything is enclosed in a glass tube, filled with a mixture of Neon and Argon gases at low pressure. When a high voltage is applied, the electrodes in the shape of numbers glow in a warm orange color.
This tubes were kept in basements in their original boxes during the Cold War. For your enjoyment, Nuvitron brings this old school technology to your home, our Nixie tubes are new old stock never used before, and are at least 30 years old. 
༶ -- DESIGN AND CRAFTSMANSHIP  -- ༶
Our art deco enclosures are all handmade by skilled artisans and each one takes over 30 hours to create. There are no mass-produced, robot-made items here.
It has a handcrafted wooden enclosure made with selected woods such as Teak and Cedar to ensure a beautiful wood grain. The skilled artisans sanded by hand each piece and then glued them together to achieve a smooth surface guaranteeing there are not two identical Vintage Nixie Clocks.
We avoided lacquers and other artificial chemicals. Instead, we used natural oils that nourish the wood allowing it to breathe in any type of weather.
It has a curved lid made with thin sheets of wood and angular legs that gives an sculptural look. And to give the modern touch, we engraved our logo with laser.

------------ ☆ HOW TO ORDER ☆ ---------------
-- 1) SELECT: Tubing Selection & Recommendations --
1"" PEX: Fabulous for the hooper that is down to chill with the hoop on his or her waist most of the time. Can be quite ""heavy"" for a hoop; the size and weight will limit ability to progress into the vast world of hoop tricks. Developmentally not recommended. Larger surface area makes tapes look stellar as ever and coils well, too. 37"" and under in diameter is recommended.
3/4"" PEX: Hands down best for beginners. The added few ounces mean worlds to the control and regulated speed offered by this tubing. Black in color, and a small bit flexy, this tubing coils like a breeze just like 5/8"" Polypro but offers an experience comparable to 3/4"" Polypro - transitioning just got real easy. 37"" and under in diameter.
3/4"" UV Polypro: Best for polypro beginners, more chill and controlled hooping, and a bit slower flow. Gnar digs the swag; slower sweeping pull-flows offer more controlled manipulations. Dampened response time, stellar for learning new tricks. 37"" and under
 
5/8"" UV Polypro: Light weight, responsive, gnarly all around. Fabulous for quick finger-tricks, doubles, minis, and a feather-light experience. May be considered bouncy at 32-34"".
34"" in diameter is your recommended max size to avoid wonk.
1/2"" UV Polypro: Lighting fast, feather light, and ultra thin. No more than 30"" OD, or else you may have a crazy noodle hoop. *Push Button unavailable for 1/2""
3/4"" HDPE: Loved by beginners, and even craved by professionals. A bit more of a 'spring' to HDPEs responsiveness than Polypro, HDPE also offers about an ounce more weight for added control and decreased speed of tricks. Creamy, and semi-translucent white, naturally.

Moodhoops require special lithium-ion batteries that are able to power all the LEDs. Normal, store-bought batteries (Alkaline or NiMh) will not power the hoop.   
Never be left in the dark! Get extra batteries with your hoop so you can glow all night or all weekend!
14500 AA-size batteries for 3/4"" tubing:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/70403237/34-hoop-batteries-14500-aa-size?ref=shop_home_active_11
Double Battery Charger:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/239168902/double-charger-for-lithium-ion-hoop?ref=shop_home_active_2
Only one lithium-ion hoop battery is used in the hoops at a time.
These batteries are compatible with 3/4"" Classic MoodHoops.

~Do not leave charging batteries unattended.

~Battery handling and charging should always be dine with adult supervision.
~Read and follow all battery instructions provided in the Battery Safety and Care guide that comes with your hoop.

~~WARRANTY~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MoodHoops guarantees the electronic internals (such as LEDs, solder joints) for 1 year.
See our Store Policies page for full details. We stand behind all of our hoops!
~Kinked, bent, or cracked tubing is not covered by the warranty. 
~Coiling and collapsing the hoop should be done very carefully and is at your own risk.
~If you kink your hoop please contact us right away and we will assist you in getting your hoop baby into the workshop and back out to you quickly <3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT HOOP TUBING~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Is the hoop collapsible?
~Sizes 34"" and up are easier to fully collapse, while sizes 32"" and less start to become more risky to fully collapse.
~Since the hoops open up, you can just partially collapse the hoop. Once the hoop is partially collapsed you can add zip ties in several places along the coiled tubing to keep it in a coiled shape.

11286,Original Claddagh Ring Sterling Silver,"
            The Claddagh ring (Irish: fáinne Chladaigh) is a traditional Irish ring given which represents love, loyalty, and friendship (the hands represent friendship, the heart represents love, and the crown represents loyalty).
The design and customs associated with it originated in the Irish fishing village of Claddagh, located just outside the old city walls of Galway, now part of Galway City. The ring, as currently known, was first produced in the 17th century.
The Claddagh ring belongs to a group of European finger rings called ""fede rings"". The name ""fede"" derives from the Italian phrase mani in fede (""hands [joined] in faith"" or ""hands [joined] in loyalty""). These rings date from Roman times, when the gesture of clasped hands was a symbol of pledging vows, and they were used as engagement/wedding rings in medieval and Renaissance Europe.
Fede rings are distinctive in that the bezel is cut or cast to form two clasped hands that symbolize faith and trust or ""plighted troth"". The Claddagh ring is a variation on the fede ring, while the hands, heart, and crown motif was used in England in the early 18th century.
Towards the end of the 20th century there was an explosion of interest in the Claddagh Ring, both as jewelry and as an icon of Irish identity. In recent years it has been embellished with interlace designs and combined with other Celtic and Irish symbols, but this is a very recent phenomenon that corresponds with the worldwide expansion in popularity of the Claddagh ring as an emblem of Irish identity.

By Patty. S. on March 2, 2017: This product is far more impressive than I had originally expected. I would definitely purchase another one without hesitation. Very well constructed. Sturdy, nice quality materials. VERY EASY to put together. It took me about an hour to construct, then again, I got easily distracted and doddled along the way...
Instructions are clearly readable and easy to follow. Packaged incredibly well. Everything within was very well organized. The overall size of this unit is perfect. The drawer sizes are adequate for a variety of uses. Very pleased!
By Haley H. on January 25, 2017: Great craft cart! I use it for my die cutter. It was easy to put together and it looks very nice. Great for doing crafts when I'm not working in my craft room.
By Marie A. on March 3, 2017: This craft cart is exactly as depicted and described. Fits where I needed it to and went together easily. I love the bright colors of the drawers and it is sturdy. The drawers have stops on the runners to prevent them from being pushed out the back. Fits my needs exactly as I have turned this rack into my long needed craft desk storage.
