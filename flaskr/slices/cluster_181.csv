20755,"Waterproof Cotton Canvas Parasols 28"" canopy & bamboo pole  NEW COLORS!","
            NEW COLORS HAVE ARRIVED!   
When I moved to the Southwest, I quickly learned that shade was valuable.  I wanted something that I could carry for shade for both coolness and sun protection, light and not as imposing as a umbrella. Parasols are the perfect solution. 
The basic cotton canvas parasols with bamboo handle and lock mechanism are handmade by artisans in Thailand to support self-sustenance, then hand painted, waterproofed, and finished at Mia Sombrilla.  The parasols have a 28"" diameter canopy with 28"" long pole.  Our parasols have a lovely rope handle for holding or hanging and the new wood tip parasols also have a braided sea grass bracelet to keep it tightly closed.  All our parasols are sturdy, and waterproof.  We provide bright colored water proofed parasols, perfect for adding color to weddings, parties, or use at Renaissance Fairs.  You can also paint your own design on a solid color using acrylic paints!  Bulk orders of 4 or more have shipping price at cost, so please contact me first for bulk orders to make a special listing using your zip code. 
Mia Sombrilla now stocks earthy colors for Renaissance Fair participants - sapphire, chocolate, prussian blue, and forest.
IN STOCK AND SHIP IMMEDIATELY:
The black canvas wrap top knot parasol comes in Off-White, Blush (pale pink), Princess Blue, and Hint-of-Mint.

TOP FINISHES:
Wood tip (fuelle) and bonnet 
Black canvas top knot 
PLEASE CHOOSE PARASOL COLOR AND WOOD TIP OR BLACK TOP KNOT WHEN PLACING YOUR ORDER.
Shipping within USA. Bulk orders of 4 or more have shipping price at cost (See Order of 4 listing). For order for more than 4 parasols please contact me first  to set up a special listing. USPS Priority Mail 1-3 day shipping. We accept returns at any time, but do not provide postage or return postage.  If an item arrives damaged or defective, please contact us right away.
CARE INSTRUCTIONS:  Our shop is in Tucson, AZ and before shipping, the parasols are washed and allowed to air dry. This helps to 'loosen' and re-stretch the cotton awning. A mild soap and water can be used to wash as needed. Open the parasol all the way and lock. Lightly wet both underside and top using a sponge or spray, and rinse with clear water, avoid soaking the top knot area. Leave the parasol locked open to air dry.        ",16.00,4.925,"Handmade item
