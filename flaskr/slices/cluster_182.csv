Purveyor’s Note:
We have searched far and wide, wrestled bears, braved the cold, traversed mountain ranges, fought pirates, swam with sharks and eaten at many a questionable road side taco stand to provide our customers with one of a kind vintage pieces. 
Know that whichever piece you choose to make your own has its own story and has traveled through time to get to you.  Though we strive to provide the absolute best, “pristine” vintage pieces are rare birds, if not altogether non-existent. 
That being said, please understand that part of buying and wearing vintage is accepting some of the imperfections that come along with pieces that are 20, 50 and sometimes 100 years old.  We refuse to be anything other than honest and strive to present our items as they are; we are more than happy to take additional photos or answer any questions you may have.  Just know that should you purchase a garment with a pinhole or a loose thread, we have done our best to describe things accurately, and that “flawed” and “vintage charm” are sometimes synonymous.

            Have you ever had a day where it felt like nothing went right? Of course you have; we all have had those days. You're human. Try out a Stress Be Gone shower steamer and see how wonderful you feel. With the citrus-y, medicinal type of scent—like a Rosemary Orange blend—I am sure that you will feel refreshed and ready to end your day on a positive note. 
🔹Why use our shower steamers?
•They are conveniently packaged and easily accessible.
•We make sure to include enough essential oils to our blend so you don't have a difficult time inhaling the scent.
•Our shower steamers are shaped as a half moon with a flat bottom. You don't want them rolling away.
•We have a proven track record of positive reviews on our shower steamers and are confident that you will enjoy them also.
🔹How do they come packaged?
Convenience is our number one concern. We package our steamers by shrink wrapping them and affixing a label to the bottom. Perfect for giving them as a gift, stocking stuffer, or even wedding/birthday favor. 
Each shower steamer is approximately 3.5 oz.. Your order will contain 1 (3.5 oz.) shower steamer. 
🔹Instructions: 
Place one shower steamer as close to you as possible—out of the way of the water stream—and drizzle water on the top to ignite the aromas from the shower steamer. Once you are finished, you can easily wash the steamer down the drain. If the directions are followed correctly, these should last 2-3 showers.

10342,Montessori Baby Set of 6 Toys -- Montessori Infant Set -- Motor Development Set,"
            *NOTE: WOOD COLORS AND TONES MAY VARY* *The previous bell rattle has been replaced with a new rattle that is safer for babies to teethe on*
We use various woods for our products based on availability, but locally harvested White Oak is most commonly used.  
This set includes everything pictured: The ball cylinder, bell cylinder, interlocking discs, ring rattle, (new and improved)bell rattle, and ball teether.  Included with the items is a description card that explain how the materials are to be used with your children.  These Montessori materials promote fine motor and gross motor development and are very satisfying for babies. These items can be used from about 2-3 months onward, when babies begin to reach for and grab things.  All these items are made with non-toxic materials and safe for teething babies.  However, some of these items have small parts.  With the new bell rattle, we have removed the outer bells to make the product safer for babies.  We have created the product so that the soft jingle comes from inside the rattle.  The product is safer for babies, and it provides the same benefit.  
ALWAYS inspect materials with small parts before offering them to your baby to ensure that all pieces are secure.  NEVER offer your baby one of these materials if a piece is loose or missing.  Use under adult supervision ONLY!
The set comes with information cards for all the products.  
This set is perfect as a gift set for a new baby!
The colored balls are stained with a non-toxic watercolor paint.  
You may notice very slight variances or imperfections in our products, as these toys are handmade.
If you need your baby set for a shower or your baby is already to this stage, and you need these toys NOW, let us know and we will make every effort to send you your toys ASAP!        ",42.00,4.932,"Handmade item

Bobbin lace is a lace textile made by braiding and twisting lengths of thread, which are wound on bobbins to manage them. 
As the work progresses, the weaving is held in place with pins set in a lace pillow, the placement of the pins usually determined by a pattern or pricking pinned on the pillow.
Bobbin lace is also known as pillow lace and bone lace, because early bobbins were made of bone or ivory.
Bobbin lace is one of the two major categories of handmade laces, the other being needlelace. source: wikipedia

INTRODUCTORY...
MUCH has been said and written upon the subject
of poultry houses. 
Still very few poultrymen
seem to understand the vital and important
principles of poultry architecture.
Many will take old, worn-out boards for material
and in a few hours throw together a
poorly-constructed shed, which they think
good enough. 
Large cracks are left between the boards and
draughts strike the fowls from almost every direction. 
In addition to this a worse blunder is often made by throwing
on a poor roof, and then concluding that everything is ready
for business. 
The cold winter sets in and the mud and rain
beats in through the open space left between the boards.
The leaky roof does its part toward letting in rain, and the
consequence is a flooded poultry house. 
Who can expect to make money out of poultry with such houses? 
Many people do or they would construct proper buildings. 
AH over the country, everywhere, may be seen hundreds of old sheds ready
to fall to pieces, but used as poultry houses.
Poorly constructed houses are as bad or worse than no houses at all.
When we have heard people complaining of the poultry
business not paying we have in most cases found that the
main reason was badly arranged and miserably built houses.
Such buildings can generally be put down as filthy and lousy,
because people who put up such sheds are not very apt to
keep them otherwise. 
Very likely the floors are not cleaned
once a year, and probably not at all. 
To obtain best results proper accommodation must be had. 
Good, warm houses can be built at a very small cost. 
If you are thinking of erecting a poultry house, go ahead and select your plans, but be
sure you have a suitable one before commencing work. 
Select a building adapted to the size of- your flock, your locality and
the lay of the land where it will be built. 
The plans given in this book are of houses which have been tested by practical,
experienced poultrymen and have been found satisfactory
under the conditions as explained. 
The ornamental features
of a poultry house should be confined to the exterior. 
The interior should be arranged with the sole view of making
the fowls comfortable and contented, and these points- are
fully explained in the following pages. 
The location should be a high and dry one and in a place Where ample shade may
be provided if possible. 
There are so many seemingly trivial
items which materially affect the value and usefulness of a
building that any one not perfectly familiar with the subject
should read carefully the suggestions and rules laid down in
this book. 
It should also be remembered that to be successful
with poultry something more than a house is needed.
The fowls should have proper care and feed, and this means
more than can be explained in a few short remarks. 
After you have the proper house, then see that the other requisites
to success are not neglected.

Amethyst is known as a meditative and calming stone.
Emotionally, amethyst is used in crystal healing to help heal personal losses and grief, bringing one gently past. Amethyst has a gently sedative energy that can promote peacefulness, happiness, and contentment. It also is said to bring emotional stability and inner strength.
Located at the very top and center of the head, the Crown Chakra is known as the seat of higher consciousness and cosmic awareness, and is our connection to our own divinity. Amethyst is the premier spiritual stone, providing purifying, healing, and protective energies to help clear, open, and balance the Crown Chakra. 
This lovely Amethyst crystal necklace makes a great gift for mom, sister, friends and especially makes a great gift for yourself!

Nose Ring Sizes (approx):
6 mm (x-Small)
9 mm (Small)
11 mm (Medium)
13 mm (Large)
Nose Ring Thickness:
24 Gauge (as thin as a needle)
22 Gauge (mechanical pencil lead)
20 Gauge (thickest)
Thickness Detailed Below:
- 24 gauge (as thin as a needle) wire nose rings are very subtle thin, and flexible, can be easily shaped to your nose for a snug fit. If you plan to take off the nose ring on a daily basis, it will not retain it's shape for that long.
- 22 gauge (as thin as mechanical pencil lead) wire nose rings are thin and more durable than the 24 gauge. 
- 20 gauge  silver wire nose rings are the thickest.
[WHAT’S INCLUDED] 
  Material: Your choice between Sterling Silver Wire or Tarnish Resistant Copper Based Silver Wire (TR)
★ My personal experience between the 2 materials: Sterling Silver lasts while with Tarnish Resistant material has lasted 6 months before discoloring!  See more detailed information below under ""more information.""
  You choose from 4 sizes
  You choose from 3 gauges (thickness)
I wanted to include different sizes because many people have their nose pierced in different areas, so I included different sizes to help insure a desired fit for everyone. 
★Not sure what size to get?★
