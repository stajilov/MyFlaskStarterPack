            *Welcome to my pattern shop! All of my patterns come with a tutorial, so if you are new to book folding you can learn this amazing craft. If you still require some help or advice, please message me through Etsy and I shall do my best to help you. Alongside receiving some instructions, you are welcome to join our support group on Facebook:  ""Book Folding, Craft and Chat with Foldilocks."" 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/378356878980633/?fref=nf
*This listing is for a book folding pattern. The pattern is in PDF format. Once your payment has cleared with Etsy, you will be able to download the pattern. To download, go to â€˜youâ€™ in the top right corner of your Etsy screen. Next, click â€˜my purchases and downloads.â€™ 
*In addition to the pattern, you will need a hard-backed book, a pencil, a ruler (in centimetres/ metric) and a little patience.
This particular pattern needs a book that has 235 leaves (470 pages) with a height around 21 centimetres high for best results. Please note that the pattern is only for the vase. The tester of the pattern has made the flowers using die cut card and paper. 
*This pattern follows the mark and measure method. What does this mean? It means you will get two measurements in centimetres for each page for you to mark. There are no fiddly graphs involved.
*Please note:
I allow you to sell any finished book you make with my patterns, but not to sell, copy or replicate the pattern in whole or part. Please see my shop policies for further information.
*I make all patterns myself, they are 100% tested (no silly computer generated 'finished product' on my listings) so you can buy with confidence.        ",4.64,4.9153,"Handmade Supply

Cleaning Sterling Silver to maintain that shine! 
All Sterling silver can tarnish over time, this is the reaction of the oxygen in the air causing the silver to oxidise.. some people prefer to have a duller finish but if you like to keep yours looking brand new, here's a couple of easy steps to do so: 
Keeping Sterling silver clean is simple, the best two ways to do so are by either purchasing a silver polishing cloth (this is usually best for chunkier pieces of jewellery). 
For your more intricate pieces, it is best for you to use silver polishing dip.. although you must note that it is not advised to do this with any jewellery that either has exsisting oxidisation or stones included (polishing cloth can be used)        ",4.64,4.7821,"Handmade item
