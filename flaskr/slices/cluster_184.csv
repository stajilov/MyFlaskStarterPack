A BIT OF HISTORY
After World War 2, Guy James opened a jewelry store in East Tennessee. It was in a small town with mostly farmers and some factory workers. He was unable to sell much gold jewelry or his favorite...antique jewelry because most of the folks he dealt with just didn't have the money. So he began to take beautiful antique gold jewelry and make molds of them and then recast them in sterling silver. He became known for his beautiful, quality and unique pieces. Mr James died in 1991. After his death, his wife just closed the shop. The jewelry just sat. She passed away in 2011 and I have been commissioned to sell the contents of the store. When I asked the son why none of this had been sold before , he told me that his mom would not allow it because she said there was a piece of their father in each piece.

3111,Vintage Chenille Bedspread SALE,"
            I have a vintage chenille bedspread which measures about 103"" L x 89"" W.  It has 2 shades of blue with the center being off white chenille.  It is a heavy chenille, very thick.  I have this resting on top of my spread with a fringe....after looking at the photo I have to clarify that the spread which is for sale has a flat edge on all sides, no fringe, the fringe is peaking through from beneath - sorry about the confusion.  There is a small hole on the middle side hem along the lower chenille line (I took a photo for you). It's about the size of a dime, maybe a bit smaller, it's hard to spot as the chenille hides it fairly well.  A few of the photo's were taken with the light on above and it cast a shadow which looks like a discoloration on the bedspread....it is clean, this is just a shadow. I believe this dates back to around the 1950's - 1960's  It is displayed in in my photo's on a queen size bed.  This has been on for 134.95.

            Create a blissful sanctuary for the little lady in your life with this lovingly handmade White Calico & Lace Teepee.
This 4 sided design stands approx 1.4m tall & each side measures approx 1.2m wide. 
I am also selling a natural colour way which is a slightly smaller size. 
This listing is for the cover only.
Due to size postage restrictions and cost of shipping, I have found it better value for my customers to supply their own poles. You can buy bamboo garden stakes from any garden nursey or Bunnings or timber dowelling. The bamboo poles are cheaper than shipping charges & it means you get your teepee cover sooner as I send it via express post. It also allows me to keep the costs low. 
Custom sizing & fabric requests welcome. Just send me a message to discuss your idea so I can provide a quote.        ",93.25,5.0,"Handmade item

14942,Magnetic Doughnut Needle Minder | Handmade with Polymer Clay | Great gift for people that love cross stitch & embroidery |,"
            No more time wasted finding lost needles during your stitching sessions! These cute needle minders, handmade with polymer clay, help to keep your needle in one place using the neodymium magnet inside, preventing you making unnecessary holes in your fabric using other needle storing methods. Plus - these colourful sewing accessories brighten up your work in progress and put a smile on people's face - they make perfect gifts for your stitching pals.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~*~ Due to a long order queue orders will take up to 3 weeks to be dispatched as they are all handmade to order. ~*~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This item will be sent to you in a protective bubble lined mailing envelope. The product is packaged inside a clear plastic display bag, and attached to a card with a product description. There is no price displayed on the product so you can send these as gifts.
The product contains two magnets, one inside the doughnut and another inside a small polymer clay heart which is placed on the back of your work to attach the minder to your fabric. The doughnut measures approximately 20mm x 20mm x 3 mm and weighs just under 2g. 
DISCLAIMER: Neodymium magnets are perfectly safe unless more than one is swallowed (but you shouldn't ingest any magnet regardless!). Please do not leave small children or people who are likely to put objects into their mouth unsupervised with these needle minders. These little sewing treats do look good enough to eat, but they certainly are not!
Due to the handmade nature of this item, the needle minders may sometimes be of slightly different weights, widths and thickness to each other and may also have the odd fingerprint as these are sculpted by hand. Care is taken to keep each needle minder a uniform size, colour and shape.

14945,"Tambour Embroidery Hook - Wood Handle, Various Needle Sizes","
            Tambour embroidery is an embroidery technique that uses  hook to make chain stitches on fabric or netting.  When done on fine tulle or netting with fine threads, the result is delicate embroidery.  When using heavier threads on fabric, the result is a decorative chain stitch that can be used for outlines or fillings. It is also used to for bead embroidery where the thread is pre-strung with beads or sequins, held under the embroidery surface and each stitch secures them to the ground fabric or net.
The wood handle is approximately 4 1/2 inches including the brass fitting, and each needle extends out of the top by about 2 inches when secured into the handle by the screw on the side.
