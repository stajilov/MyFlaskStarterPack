3330,Antique Boy's Wool Overalls NWT,"
            A charming pair of boy's quality heavy wool overalls from the Depression Era, about the mid 1930's, possibly the early 1940's. These would be the perfect overalls for a child in TV's The Walton's. They are fully lined in wool, with a snap opening and a metal ""General"" brass zipper. The slight gathering in the back of the waistline is due to a short section of elastic. The most amazing thing is that they are new with the original price tag on them - they were on sale for 75 cents (originally 5.97). The tags also says ""6 1/2"", likely the size. An amazing reminder of years gone by.

These opals are quite special as they are hand gathered and ethically sourced from a family mine in Idaho. 
I have carefully chosen the most brilliant raw opals with beautiful fire that sparkles when touched by the sunlight and milky white in low light.
My technique is called electroforming which is one of the first methods of metal forming and is a process of growing pure copper molecule by molecule on and around natural objects such as raw stones and leaves through electricity. They are then heavily plated in pure silver. Each piece takes about 36 hours in total to create and will be a timeless piece of wearable artwork for you to cherish.
You have most likely stumbled upon my shop because you love artisan crafted, one of a kind, raw stone jewelry as much as I do. I love using raw stones because no ring will ever be the same a the next and raw stones have been known to choose you as they are meant to find their wearer.
Here you will find all art pieces created by me, Alicia (Hi!), on a made to order basis. You will never find mass produced, run of the mill, fast-fashion jewelry. Only pure art and pure creativity.
All pieces are made among the Michigan woods in my cozy home studio and come ready for gift giving in a hand stamped pillow box tied up with all natural hemp twine.        ",68.00,4.8828,"Handmade item
