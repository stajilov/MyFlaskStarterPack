9777,Settlers of Catan Case Style Organizer - Case not included,"
            Made to be a full storage solution for the Settlers of Catan board game, we present a custom storage organizer that will allow you to safely store and carry all of the following games in one box:
-Settlers of Catan Base Game & 5-6 Player Expansion
-Seafarers & 5-6 Player Expansion
-Cities and Knights & 5-6 Player Expansion
-Traders and Barbarians & 5-6 Player Expansion
-Explorers and Pirates & 5-6 Player Expansion
Included with our organizer are 4 removable trays that hold all of the roads, settlements, cities, fish, tokens, gold, etc., When everything is inside of the Catan Box the 4 included trays and lid prevent the tokens from mixing together allowing for a quick and easy start to every game.  There is also room underneath the 4 removable trays and the land hex tray for holding any extra boarders or large playing tiles.  This organizer is designed to fit inside of a standard Hobby Lobby Item #125005 All Media Artist Supply Case, or similar case/box with minimum inside dimensions of 15-7/8"" Wide x 12-1/8"" Deep x 4-3/16"" Tall.
*Although extremely uncommon, we are not liable for the organizer not fitting in a purchased or custom made case/box since we are unable to control outside manufacturing practices and tolerances.  Out of the 250 cases we have tested so far, all but 3 of them have worked for our inserts.  In the unlikely event that a purchased case does not work it should be exchanged with the seller for a different case.
All of our organizers are made of MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) and include page by page instructions for an easy assembly.  Superglue is recommended for assembly.
Please see our listing for the ""Settlers of Catan Box Organizer with Carrying Case"" for just the fully assembled with case version of this organizer as well as for pictures of the finished product installed in the recommended Hobby Lobby 125005 Artist Case.        ",40.00,4.8355,"Handmade item

10037,Catan Box Organizer Insert,"
            With Catan becoming all the rage and with numerous expansions, Firefly Workshop saw a need to make things a little more convenient and organized for our followers and lovers of Catan. This Box Organizer Insert allows you to fit your standard box set and its 5-6 player extension conveniently within the original box.
This organizer features an angled tray to hold all of the land tiles as well as 3 removable trays that can be used to hold both the standard sized playing cards (will fit sleeved or un-sleeved cards.  Underneath the 3 removable trays is additional storage to hold the larger flat items such as the building cards, longest road, largest army, borders and more.  
We recommend this organizer for use with the base game and its 5-6 player extension, however there is additional room in the land area and card tray that can be used to hold some of the player piece bags and bags of other misc. tokens if you desire to try and combine additional sets into this organizer.  Please note that due to the size of some of the border pieces and specialty land tiles/Flip Books (Rivers of Catan, Knights and Pirates & Explorers especially) they will not fit underneath the trays and would need to be stored on top of everything which would prevent the lid from closing all of the way which is why we recommend this for the base set only.
 Made of MDF (Medium Dense Fiberboard). All of our box organizers include page by page instructions for an easy assembly.
*If you have purchased our smaller Settlers of Catan Box Organizer in the past and wish to upgrade to the larger carrying case, let us know and we will apply a 10 credit towards the purchase of the carrying case.        ",22.50,4.8355,"Handmade item

‚ô• Most pieces can be stamped ONLY on the front of the piece because a slight impression of the letter shows through to the other side. 
‚ô• After packages have been shipped, we have no control over them. If you have not received an item in the stated time, please let us know and we can help you locate the item. 
‚ô• INTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Please be aware that some International shipments may take as long as 5-6 weeks for delivery because of customs delays. There is the option to upgrade to priority shipping at checkout, we recommend you do so. Duty fees or additional country-specific fees are always the responsibility of the buyer, and I would recommend researching these fees before buying.
‚ô• NOTE: Each piece is hand hammered into the metal, letter-by-letter. Spacing and depth of letters may vary slightly. Don't look at these as imperfections, the small differences simply add to the individuality of each piece.
