288,Steckel suitcase Aircase Burl wood Edition,"
            ROOT WOOD EDITION
A new case from the Aircase series of Steckei case a new highlight at the highest level of technology in the construction of the case. Each used a maple Burl veneer sheet for each outside of this case. Hard to believe but true this case is due to its special coating only Steckei case significantly more robust than vergleich32bare used leather luggage. The processing of this coating is certified by the French Navy is very expensive since at least 8 steps are necessary until the finish of your suitcase. Alone the finish of the case takes about 14 days therefore with all steps. Although the coating is based on natural binders, this still guaranteed longevity, a very good UV - resistance and an exceptional resistance to external load. The Interior is another highlight. Here, we chose a fine-pored Bentley leather in the shade burnt oak. The weight of this case is only 2.5 kg empty, making it just as easy as an ordinary case.

5567,"Antique Art Deco Bridal Hair Clip, OOAK Small 1920s Rhinestone Flapper Hair Accessory, 1930 Vintage Gatsby Hair Comb, Edwardian Victorian","
            Offering a stunning unique smaller scale Art Deco/Edwardian bridal hair clip made from an authentic 1920's - 1930's era paste rhinestone dress/fur clip.  An ornate, very well made, 2 1/8 inch (5.3 cm) long by 1 1/8 inch (2.8 cm) wide pot metal SO Art Deco/Edwardian shaped setting is completely encrusted in varying sized sparkly clear round cut crystals and has been securely attached to a new high quality silver plated alligator clip base.  I love the simple yet elegant shape and design of this one and the way the designer set the crystals so close together!  It's smaller but it has SO much presence!  Jewel is in wonderful vintage condition with all rhinestones present, accounted for, and bright.  Though it has so much sparkle, the jewel has mellowed just a tad creating that softer authentic antique look and feel that can only be achieved with age.  They don't make jewelry anymore with this quality. Don't settle for vintage ""look"" (that always looks like a reproduction) cookie-cutter produced when you can have a unique hair comb made from a true antique/vintage jewel!  (Note last photos is of Downton Abbey's Lady Mary just to give you a better idea of how the comb could be used.  It would also be lovely clipped next to an updo).
 Clip will arrive wrapped in tissue inside a gift box.
*** Regarding quality - I have been making altered couture jewelry from vintage jewels for years. I use high quality silver and gold plated comb and clip bases and guarantee that the jewels will not come off. If you read through my feedback, you will find that my clients continue to be very happy with the quality of the pieces they purchase from my shop as well as the outstanding customer service.
