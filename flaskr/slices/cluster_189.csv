8754,BULGARIAN ROSE essential oil with Rose Quartz gemstone inside~ Oil of Love ~ Healing ~ Heart Chakra ~ Aphrodisiac ~ Nightshade Botanicals,"
            Roses are widely considered the most beautiful flowers in the world. The flower is an integral part of innumerable stories, legends, myths and legacies. Bulgarian Rose, cultivated since the 16th century, is considered to produce the finest quality essence. The aroma of this oil is full and rich, intoxicating and an aphrodisiac. Rose can be elevating to the mind and spirit, bring balance and harmony and is  considered the essential oil of the 'highest vibration'. The scent is divinely sweet, rich, and deeply floral. 60,000 roses are needed to distill a single ounce of oil, or about 60 roses PER DROP. With a deep and luxurious floral aroma, this oil is both soothing and uplifting. It is great when sad or tired and a tonic for the female reproductive system. Truly a sensual and delightful oil, romantic, creative, and gently cheering. 
There are a number of historical traditions associated with rose. The Greeks associated the rose with Aphrodite, goddess of love, beauty, arts and creativity. Rose is seen as the supreme oil of the ‘heart chakra’, the center of love. In medieval Christian tradition, the scent of rose was associated with the presence of angels.

            This men's brown leather bracelet in the style of a Celtic bracelet, is made from genuine rich brown leather cord and quality metal cast antiqued copper Zamak hardware. A hypoallergenic, certified lead and nickel free unisex bracelet that closes with a sleek, strong, secure, tube shaped, copper magnetic clasp. The Celtic knot is secured with black rubber o rings and copper jump rings. Made to any bracelet size in the drop down menu. 
EASY SIZING: Wrist size (measured without slack)  wiggle room (no more than 1/4"") = YOUR BRACELET SIZE! 
So if wrist measures 7"" you need to order size 7 1/4""
(Make CERTAIN to measure your wrist end to end. If no measuring tape, wrap a piece of string or strip of paper around wrist, and measure flat. Add 1/4"" to your wrist measurement to get size you need to order)
As popular with women as with men, this is a thinner, more lightweight version of Sirious Design's original Celtic cuff bracelet. Comfortable to wear, and looks great by itself or in a stack with other leather bracelets or wrap bracelets. Often purchased in pairs as couple jewelry or friendship bracelets to be worn by each person as a reminder of shared and eternal commitment and love.
Did you know?
General symbolism of Celtic interlace can be expressed as representing the repeated crossings of the spiritual and physical paths in our lives. These never-ending paths are often said to symbolize ""the permanence and the continuum of life, love, and spirituality.""
