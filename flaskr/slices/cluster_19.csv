            ANTIQUE GERMAN Josephs Coat Handmade large Marble
Blue, Turquoise, white
 1 1/2 "" Handmade Marble Shooter 
A large antique Shooter size  marble
with Pontil and manufacturing marks and chips/flea bites
The earliest glass marbles were generally made by creating long canes that would have a clear or transparent-colored base surrounding tiny rods of colored glass. The molten blob would be pulled to create a slender cane that might be 20 to 50 feet long. The cane would be heated until it was maleable enough to be twisted and cut at one end with marble scissors, which were created around 1846 and had a little cup on them that would help form the hot glass into a perfect sphere.
I believe this is a marble by Kuhnert & Company (Company founded by Gunter Kuhnert and his sons In 1861 ) Please see middle marble on second row of final image.        ",132.66,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1940s

1821,Antique French Mirror - Antique French Louis XVI Period Gilt Mirror with Antique Glass,"
            Antique French Mirror - Antique French Louis XVI Period Gilt Mirror with Antique Glass
This is a wonderful French mirror featuring a simple gilt frame around the glass. 
The frame itself is a traditional moulded frame on the outside edge and has the  gilt beading on the inside next to the glass. The frame has a lot of charm and wear with the worn layers of gilt work.
In the 18th century they would make the main frame and then apply it on another frame (behind it). If you look from the side you see the second frame, which gives it authenticity and a wonderful look.  
The back of the mirror is antique wood but does not look to be original.  We believe the glass was replaced at some point with old antique glass.
The mirror itself appears to be old Mercury glass, which is glass that was originally produced in the 19th century.  The glass has the appearance of looking hazing and has some missing silver. This makes this mirror exceptionally charming, because of the distressed glass. 
This mirror is currently set up for a ""portrait"" handing with basic eye hooks and wire. It can easily be changed to hang sideways or ""landscape"" for the look of your choice.

            These beautiful blue Ball mason jars, once used for home canning, make a great farmhouse or cottage chic accessory for your home.
 
This listing is for ONE quart jar and does not include a zinc lid.  This quart jar measures 7"" tall and 4"" in diameter and says ""Ball Perfect Mason"".  I have a number of these jars available, so while you will not recieve the exact jar pictured above, your jar is guaranteed to say ""Ball Perfect Mason"" and be an authentic vintage blue jar.  The shade of blue may vary slightly from jar to jar, but the difference in the color in the above photos is due to adjustments in light sources when photographing them.  Third photo shows a quart jar next to a smaller pint jar for size comparison.
This jar does not come with a zinc lid, but I have them available for purchase in my shop here:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/115745997/set-of-3-vintage-zinc-lids-for-mason
Nothing says vintage farmhouse or classic cottage like the celebrated blue Ball jar.  The perfect vase for your favorite flowers, this vintage canning jar has a beautiful blue color that simply sparkles in the sunlight.  The Ball company has not made these blue jars since 1937, so you know you are capturing a piece of American history when you purchase this jar.

2260,Vintage Napier Shell Charm Bracelet Eugene Bertolli Jewelry B7282,"
            Vintage Napier shell charm bracelet is shown in ""The Napier Co."" book on page 538.  It is really beautiful and unique.  This 1982 design from Eugene Bertolli is nicely detailed in beautiful gold tone metal.  Bracelet has a fold over clasp and is signed NAPIER©.  The metal is in very good to excellent condition with very minor wear on the clasp and underside. I believe a few shell charms are missing but it does not detract from this - especially with the lovely condition.   Measures 7 1/2 inches X 5/8 inch wide.

Yes, my husband and I had a Children's Boutique for more than 30 years. We closed our doors in 2012 to open our Online Etsy shop CecysChildren. We have many beautiful Vintage children clothes, Baptismal gowns, accessories, shoes, etc., that are still carefully stored, waiting to be posted soon. In the mean time enjoy what we have listed, and do contact with any questions.
I also do design some of our Baptismal gowns, and hair accessories, those I will be restocking missing sizes as soon as I possibly can.

3921,Panoramic Photo - Vintage Photo - Black & White Photograph - Old Photo Decor - Montclair Operetta Club - Theater Group Panorama Photograph,"
            Vintage photographs make interesting wall decor in a home, office, or workshop.  This black & white panoramic group shot shows the cast and supporting crew for the Montclair Operetta Club's Spring 1950 production of ""The Student Prince."" 
This old photo is an original print not a reproduction.  The panorama group picture measures approximately 19 1/4 inches long by 8 1/4 inches. 
The vintage photo is in good condition.  There is a crease on the left-hand side of the photograph, a few brown spots, and pin hole marks at the corners. There is a slight curling at the edge of the long photograph.  
I have two other panoramic group photographs from the Montclair Operatta company, ""The New Moon"" produced November 1949 and ""Song of Norway"" produced November 1950.  Condition is about the same for these photographs.  Interested in all three vintage photos?  Let me know and I'll put together a package deal.

4196,Gucci bag years 70,"
            Lovely Gucci Bag 70 years. The exterior is made of fabric monogrammed with brown leather inserts. The cosmetic bag and large enough and although the exterior is in good condition, the Interior isn't quite as likely due to perfumes that have discolored lining and created showy unstitching. Everything can be solved by restoring the skin shiny and sheathing the Interior with new fabric. The opening takes place thanks to a Brown velcro as the leather used. On the fabric monogrammed stands out the iconic Gucci red and green typical band and inside on a leather tag we find the Gucci Parfums Made in Italy.
Although the article has garish signs of wear that can be resolved, there remains a very current and stylish Kit thanks to the clever use of materials and contrasting colors. Can be from women and men and is perfect to be transported maybe in our movements or sported on our heads.        ",45.53,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1970s

            This wonderful piece of Blue Samsonite luggage Silhouette soft sided carry on bag is a circa 1960's piece of luggage.
Key is not included for zipper lock but seems to be a generic fit.
The condition is good and wear is consistent with use and age.
Measures 16""l x 14.5h x 7w at the bottom tapers to 3.5w at top.
One handle has some pulled stiches, but does not effect the function. There are some scuffs and scratches but overall this bag is in very good condition.

Remember the Trimline phone keychains from the 1970's?  They were meant to be promotional pieces but they really caught on; I used mine as a Barbie Doll phone.   Here is your chance to own one again.......just because.  Better yet, gift it to a 70's child and watch the look on their face.  This one is baby blue and has a rotary dial.  It is in good vintage condition.  Very nostalgic.

            I acquired a lot of vintage 1940s WW2 correspondence letters from a collector who had been collecting them for over 20 years. Although most are addressed to two people back and fourth. They date from the early 1940s to the mid 1940s. From the few I read, they describe the emerging feelings of their distance communication from each other as well what is going on in each other's life. Also there are some vintage newspaper clippings and money transfers in the letters but it's slim you would receive that. Most if not all have that period stamps and they have not been checked for errors or varieties. 
Great for collectors or crafts.

Condition:  Quilt is strong and in good condition.  There are areas in the applique that have some minor  tear and shatter from age. There are two 1"" tears in the white ground, near the edge... not glaring.  Also a small stain dead center that does not detract. The quilt looks to have been laundered... oh well... It also looks to have been made larger with an add on on 2 sides; I have pictured it.  It blends but still is an add on.

6141,100% Natural Paw Balm for dogs - Paw Wax,"
            Protect your pampered pet's paws from the elements with this Paw Balm.  
We start with coconut oil, infused with organic calendula flowers, beeswax for it's protective qualities and a touch of neem oil.  Beeswax will act as a protective coating against snow and salt, while oils moisturize.  
For small dogs, place their warm paw on top of the balm and rotate the tin to apply.  You may want to work in with your hands.  For bigger dogs, you can use the same method, just doing parts of the paw at a time.  Or simply scoop a little product out with a popsicle stick or the back of your fingernail and rub it into their paw pads.  
Great for pets who don't mind going out for walks in the cold and snow.  Our Jack Russell Terrier, Maggie, is more of a do your business and get back in the house warm weather lover, but we still use to moisturize and protect her paws for those couple minutes outside at a time!

            A fun suncatcher shoal of little stained glass fish swimming with or against the tide........... This shoal is in various shades of blue and green textured glass which really sparkle in the sunshine.
A variation on the 'sprats' sun catchers I make in threes and fives.
To remind you of the seaside, they look fantastic in a bathroom or kitchen or wherever floats your boat!
Made by me in my workshop in Rochester and photographed in my garden, influenced by  days out at the beach in Whitstable.
Measurements
These little fish measure approximately 15cm x 10cm, the colours will vary due to the nature of the glass, each little fish measures about 6.5cm x 2cm.
Every piece of glass sold is very well packaged, so you can be confident that it will arrive in perfect condition.        ",39.80,4.8182,"Handmade item

6775,Fresh Live Moss Variety Pack! (Terrarium Assortment Pack),"
            This is a bag of our top choice moss. It is guaranteed pesticide free and pre-cleaned. It is a hand selected blend of 10 species of mosses and lichens. Some of the variety includes reindeer lichen, feather moss, pillow moss, and sphagnum moss, just to name a few. This is perfect for floral arrangements, gifts, wreath-making, bonsai gardens, terrarium or vivariums, and much more! We pack each order as it comes in, to ensure freshness. These mosses are very hardy if kept properly. We suggest using distilled or purified water to water them, as mosses can be sensitive to the salts present in tap water.
We pack each bag one layer thick, and do not compress the bags, as these are sensitive living mosses and designed for propagation. Each bag doesn't contain every species pictured, but we include a beautiful diversity and array (yes, the red moss is always included!), and you'll be happy, guaranteed!
Sorry, we do not ship internationally at the moment.        ",8.00,4.8846,"Handmade Supply

6916,"Invitro Fertility (IVF) Planner Stickers for Erin Condren, Plum Paper, Filofax, Kikki K, Limelife, Inkwell Press, Happy Planner, & Planners","
            Preparing for an IVF procedure or are you starting from the beginning of this course of fertility treatment? Mark your progress and important procedures with these stickers.
Included are over 180 stickers including Cycle Start, Egg Retrieval, Med Change (8), Embryo Transfer (2), Beta Check (8), Bed Rest (4), Doctor Appointment (7), Ultrasound (4), POAS (3), Follicle Count (5), 90 pill stickers and 72 injection stickers for any related medication you might need to mark. The stickers are no wider than 1.4"".
These stickers come on 2 (two) 7.5 x 5.875 sheets with a punch guide to place the sheet in a mini binder.
As a surrogate, I've seen first hand how devastating infertility can be. That is why I decided to come up with several sets to help those involved within the IUI, IVF and other processes to make their steps in their individual journeys. I wish you all the sticky thoughts and baby dust your way to make your dreams of a family come true!
I started with an empty planner and coloring pencils. I drew various images into my planner before moving up to drawing on sticker paper and cutting them out. Once I discovered planner stickers the sky was the limit for me. I used them to mark important dates and times and then for fun and decoration!
These stickers are printed on matte sticker paper, making it easy to write on them with any type of pen or marker you prefer. You can use them as-is, as a regular sticker, or to take down notes, to-do lists, reminders, appointments, etc.! The size, height, width, etc. of each sticker varies depending on the particular image. These stickers are perfect for adding some colorful flair and POP to your planner whilee also making important items, dates, appointments, and more stand out on your page!
All stickers come on sheets and individually die-cut, ready to easily peel off and stick onto your planner, calendar, note cards, gifts, decorations, or scrapbook projects! Please look at the included photos for a reference to their size in the Erin Condren Life Planner daily box in the weekly view. Your stickers will be professionally packaged and ready to use yourself or to give as a gift!
Glossy and matte vinyl stickers are available for any sticker for an additional charge. Glossy stickers are an additional 1 and matte vinyl stickers (which are made out of a water resistant vinyl material) are an additional 1.75 per set.
If you want a combination of matte, glossy, or matte vinyl, leave a note in the “notes to seller” section indicating which sticker type you would like in which finish if you haven’t already done so.
All orders are printed and cut upon RECEIVING the order due to the large amount of personalization on orders received. If you have any questions or need a rush order, please message me and I will work with you to meet your needs.
I love making stickers. I am constantly working on new additions to my shop while processing and filling orders. I also work full time- sometimes up to 50 hours a week- while also running a busy household including a rambunctious infant! I list my processing time as 1-2 weeks and most of the time I beat that expected time. I work 5 days a week on my shop but I do take 2 days a week to spend with my family!
Thank you for looking at my shop and I look forward to sending you something that will help you organize your life!        ",8.00,4.9816,"Handmade item

ABOUT THIS SCRUB
===================
A perfect little gift for yourself or a friend, this Wildflower Honey Sugar Scrub includes sugar and strawberry seeds for great exfoliation. 
This sugar scrub is handmade in small batches. It is a traditional, non-foaming, simple sugar scrub made mainly with sugar and moisturizing jojoba oil. It also contains potassium cocoate (an all natural potassium salt that originates from the fatty acids present in coconut oil), which provides moisturizing and light foaming.
The scrub is scented with wildflower and a touch of honey. It has a floral feel, with a warm honey undertone.
There is a full 4 oz (by weight) of this scrub in a recyclable BPA-free plastic container. 
To use, apply a small amount directly to skin, add water, scrub to exfoliate and rinse off. This product does include a preservative, so it is okay to get it wet in the shower. Just be careful, as this scrub can be slippery in the shower!
Ingredients: Sugar, jojoba oil, potassium cocoate, strawberry seeds, fragrance oil, optiphen (preservative).
This product is Paraben and MPG Free.
ABOUT ME
==========
All my products are handmade by me in very small batches in my studio in Longmont, Colorado. My soap is cold process soap, which means that I make the recipe from scratch with full control of all the ingredients. Each bar of soap cures for 4 to 6 weeks. This ensures that all the water has evaporated and leads to a harder bar of soap that will last longer.

            These white above the toilet bathroom shelves are so versatile!  You can dress them up for a very classic look, or add splashes of color for a whimsical look!
They are perfectly sized to create both storage and display space above your toilet.  Your shabby chic rolled bath towel rack measures approximately 21"" wide and 11"" high.  The interior shelf sections are 7 3/4"" high.  The outside sections are 5 1/2"" wide, and the center section approximately 7"" wide.  The shelves are 5"" deep making the top shelf large enough to hold rolled towels.
These chunky rustic wood shelves are made from reclaimed wood, so you will find nail holes, staple holes, saw marks and even small cracks to add to the uniqueness of each piece.  The back is made from new plywood to give it strength.
This 2 shelf bathroom wall organizer was stained a coastal gray, then dry painted with a flat white.   It was then distressed; then clear coated to protect against bathroom moisture.
This bathroom shelf takes about 10 days to 2 weeks to make and finish.  The unit comes complete with two wall hangers that securely attach it to any sheet rock wall.  Instructions for hanging are included, and the only tool required is a philips screwdriver.
These white above the toilet bathroom shelves may also be available with boat cleat towel hooks on the side, as shown in the last photo above.  Check them out here:

Etsy only allows 1 shipping weight to be entered for each listing so it is set for the heaviest weight that's how it's calculated, I don't add anything to shipping.

7789,100% Pure Raw Natural Honey Comb Full of Honey in Box 10 oz,"
            Natural Honeycomb with raw honey from 2016 summer in a box approximately 10 oz (300 gr). Honey collected in northern Michigan in fields with wild flowers.  
Comb honey is a sample of nature's purest and most sweet food, having not been altered in any way, distilled from the nectar and put in the container by the bees themselves. most popular way to eat it is chew like gum. We like to scoop it into our tea, as the beeswax and honey will melt into the tea, providing natural sweetness. Each comb square is approximately 10-12 oz. 
Honey never spoils, although because it is raw and unprocessed it will granulate (thicken and crystallize) over time. 
Our bees visit wildflowers near Traverse City, Michigan. We practice chemical-free beekeeping, maintaining the health of our hives using only natural methods.

-CONTACT ME IF YOU ARE COVERING EXISTING PILLOWS WITH NON-REMOVABLE COVERS so I can size your covers accordingly.~

8273,Utterly Amazing Probiotic Deodorant 2.5 oz,"
            Note: Not all probiotic deodorants are created nor work the same. Please make sure your body products are made with high quality, organic and non GMO ingredients. You can find that promise here at Charibelle's.  This product sells all over the US with very happy customers! 
With your order you will get a 2.5 oz tube of high quality, high end Probiotic Deodorant. This deodorant is 100% NATURAL and Aluminum, Parabens, Propylene glycol, Phthalates, and Triclosan FREE, unlike most commercial deodorants. This recipe is composed of sumptuous ingredients such as Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, Arrowroot powder and Vitamin E to nurture your skin. Strong active ingredients include Baking Soda and Probiotic Powder which many people boast about having effective powers to help improve the balance of bacteria on your skin, very similar to the way they improve the balance of bacteria in your digestive system- said in another way, you won't stink!  We use high quality ingredients including shelf stable probiotics which makes it possible to store your deodorant at room temperature instead of keeping it refrigerated. A single tube will go a long way since it takes a small amount to be effective and lasts all day.
*  Just as a tip for choosing the scent- men generally prefer the eucalyptus, bergamot or tea tree scent the best because of their deeper tones. Women seem to enjoy them all, especially lavender and lemon grass. If you have a request for a scent, please convo me and I will try to get it for you!
*The natural oils, butters and waxes used in this product have a scent of their own, the most prominent being cocoa butter and beeswax. They smell amazing on their own and blend well with essential oils.
*Want to order more than 3? Please email me and I will make you your own personal listing :)
NOTES:
*A little goes a long way! No need to ""slather"" the deodorant under your arms, rather patting or blotting it is the most effective way to use this. ""Slathering"" has the potential to discolor clothing in which we cannot be responsable for, sorry.
*This is not an antiperspirant. We believe that our bodies have their reasons for their function and to inhibit this function will disrupt the ebb and flow of the system. To sweat is normal and healthy.
*The topical use of probiotics is hitting the mainstream and is new to a lot of people. Please do your research and read testimonials on this wonderful product.
*Product is a little softer than store bought deodorant due to the natural unrefined butters and oil. It reacts to the warmth of  your skin for easy application. Remember to ""pat"" or ""blot"" your under arms instead of ""slathering"" it on.
*Potential irritation can occur if you are sensitive to baking soda. If you are sensitive to baking soda or think that you might be I can make your deodorant without it, please let me know.        ",8.00,4.9655,"Handmade item

8286,Natural Probiotic Deodorant Mineral - aluminium free Skin Care Bath Body Beauty Unscented Nut Free Gift Guide,"
            Why switch to a natural deodorant? Do you know that commercial deodorant includes phthalates, propylene glycol, parabens, Triclosan (classified as a pesticide by the FDA) and much more. Why continue to use that? This is better choice when it comes to taking care of our bodies and breast. 
    If this is your first time using it, it could take some days to adjust and after that it would be a smooth ride! Our best selling deodorant cream for 3 years now in a tube to eliminate dipping in a jar.  Free of all harsh chemicals, phthalates and parabens. 
What makes our  natural deodorant better? It contains natural oils, does not include propylene glycol or parabens. A better alternative for those who wish to live a better lifestyle. Aluminum Free baking soda is added to absorb moisture, arrow root powder, rice bran oil, aloe to soothe and olive oil. Tea tree essential oil has been added for its wonderful properties. Along with probiotic powder!  We all know how good they are for our guts,  how much more for our underarms.

8293,LAVENDER | Probiotic Natural Deodorant | Organic | Vegan | Breast Health | Organic Skin Care | Green Beauty,"
            Skin Food Probiotic Deodorant was named a product  ""MUST HAVE"" at a Regional Breast Cancer Awareness  Convention. 
If you are switching your beauty and personal care products and do not know where to start I strongly encourage to START HERE! Deodorant is a product that most use every single day and studies are proving that the incidence of breast cancer is on the rise. Ingredients that are present in your drug store deodorant to avoid include aluminum,parabens,Triclosan
(which is actually classified as a pesticide by the FDA), phthalates, propylene glycol and fragrance. 
When you think of the glands that are located in your armpits and knowing it takes chemicals 26 seconds to reach our blood stream....would you like to rethink directly applying these chemicals to you pits???
What you should know about Natural Deodorant....you will sweat. It is completely unnatural not to sweat.  The ingredients used in a natural deodorant will work as an odor absorbing moisturizing antimicrobial. This formula took 2 years to perfect.  Each batch is pH tested, lowering the chance of reaction and also providing you with a stable product that is extremely effective.  With a base of Coconut Oil and Shea Butter it is a soothing application and will improve the health of the underarm tissue.  The arrowroot powder absorbs moisture and provide a silky feel.
I am forgetting the best part!!! The probiotics! Balancing the bacteria and restoring your pH.  We all know we have good and bad bacteria and the benefits of probiotics. Allowing the application through a major area of absorbtion is a great way to restore balance. 
This DEO is a cream deodorant. It is recommended to be applied using your fingertips. Using a small amount of product each time gently massage into your arnpits. It will look creamy at first on the skin but then is absorbed and you are left with a layer of powders that absorb the moisture. It will only leave a residue on your clothing if you use too much or put your clothing on before the product has been absorbed. It is easily rubbed out. If you have excess deodrant left on your hands you can gently massage into your hands and it will leave them feeling soft. 
If your deodrant arrives super soft from travel I recommend to place it in the fridge to harden up a bit. Store your deodrant in a cool dry place. If traveling with your deodrant be sure to always have the lid securely in place to avoid leaking.
Keep using and you too will restore you pH and health! The primary ingredients of this deodorant have a melting temperature of about 76 degrees so it will soften in a warmer climate. You can pop this in the refrigerator to harden at any time. I prefer to keep mine in a cool dry place. My unmentionable drawer. :) I have also found that I prefer to use as a cream deodorant and apply using two fingers and lightly massaging into my arm pits!

            weight(350g) 12 oz by weight  in pet plastic jar BPA FREE 
NO-STRIP, NATURAL HAIR REMOval 
This can be used by men or women on any type of hair anywhere on the body- face, legs, armpits, bikini, back, chest, arms- anywhere!
Sugaring is less painful than conventional waxing and much safer! No burns, no chemicals - great for sensitive skin!
With Sugaring your hair will grow back finer, lighter and softer
instructions:
Before sugaring skin is cleansed of any lotions or oils and apply a light dusting of baby powder or cornstarch (see dusting powder here,  
https://www.etsy.com/listing/252375979/natural-dusting-powder-with-lavender?ref=shop_home_active_5
 
 and rub softly into skin. Remember, more isn't better. Applying too much powder will interfere with removing the hair. Powder acts as a buffer helping the paste to grasp the hair better and stick less to the skin.
take the sugaring product and roll it into a ball. Don't press too hard, just work it lightly in your hands So when you do apply it, the paste will be warmed up a bit by your body heat. keep stretching the sugar wax out with your fingers until it become opaque color 
apply sugar to hair in the OPPOSITE direction of growth firmly allowing the paste to spread as you somewhat slowly pull it. You need to use some pressure and feel like you're pressing the paste against the skin for it to stick. not just laying it on top of the hair.
The sugar paste is peeled off quickly,with fast flicking motion in the same direction as the hair growth. 
You don't want to pull your hand up, but aim for way over to the other side. You won't remove as much hair or cause breakage if you pull your straight hand up.
By removing hair in the same direction of growth also helps to avoid breaking the hair follicle either above or below the skin's surface.
This means, you'll get longer-lasting hair-free results and avoid pesky ingrown hairs
If all of the sugar doesn't come off, just put the sugar that's already in your hand with the part that is left and remove in the same fast, flicking motion.
Continuing the Process
Keep working in sections on the area that you're removing hair. If you miss some hair, you can apply it over the same area skin more than once (unlike waxing)

9013,Authentic Aleppo Soap (20%) - FREE US SHIPPING - Natural Antiseptic Skin Care Soap,"
            Natural Antiseptic Legendary Syrian Castile soap made by local Aleppian soap-maker using centuries old family recipe. 
Made with local olive and laurel bay tree fruits of Southeastern Turkey, this bar aged nine months in the open air to harden (during this time outside of the soap turns pale gold and inside remains green, creating Aleppo Soap’s trademark dual color).
The soap is so pure in its form that it only contains olive oil, laurel bay oil, sodium hydroxide and water. It has no preservatives, chemical additives or fragrances.
Added laurel bay oil (20%) makes Aleppo soap a potent antiseptic. It disinfects skin without over-drying or causing irritation. In fact, it is much safer option than the advertised antibacterial soaps which contain antibiotics and long-term use can lead to antibiotic resistant bacteria and various health problems.
Finally, longer drying time and quality of its ingredients make Aleppo Soap last much longer than other commercial soaps.  
The origin of Aleppo Soap is lost in time, however, tales about its popularity goes all the way back to famous Egyptian Queen ""Cleopatra"" as she used Aleppo Soap regularly to purify her skin. 
Due to handmade nature of this product, bars weight between 195 to 205 grams, labelled as 6.88 Oz.

9038,Drawing Salve / Acne Treatment / Splinter Removal / Insect Stings / First Aid / Black Salve,"
            Drawing Salve / Acne Treatment / Splinter Removal / Insect Stings / First Aid / Black Salve
This black Drawing Salve contains activated charcoal which helps to pull splinters, bee stingers and toxins from the skin. Also good for poison ivy and EXCELLENT for cystic acne. 
It may seem wrong and counterintuitive to put something so ""goopy"" and thick into our face to clear acne but the fact is, the worst thing you can do is over dry the skin, which is what all those salicylic acid products do. When the skin drys, it cracks , and this allows a little home for infection. Instead, this salve keeps the area moist while the charcoal and bentonite clay literally pulls the dirt and bacteria out and tea tree oil fights infection.

9174,Triangular Triple EDC Spinner Fidget Toy,"
            These spinner toys are made using PLA plastic and bearings/brass/stainless/copper counterweights. The metal weights are cut by hand and have a semi-beveled edge. The center grips feature a concave surface for comfort and control. Spinners purchased with the solid metal counterweights will spin significantly longer than those with bearing counterweights.
Due to the unfinished nature of the metal, the solid metal counterweights will patina over time giving them a worn but appealing appearance.
A variety of frame colors and weights are available. The transparent colors are semi-transparent and will appear as more of a gemstone color, not completely see through.
The color order in the list corresponds to the colors in the image above.

Made from solid oak, comes with a deck of playing cards. Also included are 6 metal cribbage pegs in 3 different colors in a Royal Blue felt pouch. Storage for cribbage pegs is NOT available due to the depth of the holes and engraving or carvings. Includes felt pads on the bottom of the cribbage board so it won't scratch your furniture. The edges of the board will be slightly rounded as to make it a little more comfortable to handle.
The rendition of the cribbage board shown in the store would be one colored stain for the board and a darker colored stain to highlight the numbers, start, finish, and skunk lines in the Cribbage board. The top coat finish will be clear satin polyurethane for a life time of protection. If your request includes a carving of and image into the wood, I will use different colored stains to highlight the features on the carving. 
Just about any font is available. All text will be engraved into the wood. 
Please contact me for customization requests, and I'll send you a rendition of what the cribbage board will look like when it's done.
Thanks for taking a look.

10131,EDC Triple Fidget Spinner Bar Toy ** Now Lubed with Bones Speed Cream**,"
            All Spin Bearings come lubed with BONES SPEED CREAM.
We are cleaning out the factory lube and re-lubricating all Spin Bearings with Bones Speed Cream to improve performance and spin times.
Don't get stuck with slow sticky bearings anymore!
Do you fidget at your desk with pens, paper clips, or whatever is around? This fidget spinner is a fun way to keep your hands busy!  This will be the perfect Every Day Carry (EDC) for you.
Three bearings surround the center bearing. Printed in PLA (Renewable BioPlastic) with the bearings of your choice.
• Bones Reds center spin bearing: Option for better spin performance
• Ceramic center spin bearing: Ceramic ball bearings with steal races for best performance
• Black Panther center spin bearing: Black and Gold ceramic bearings; Ultra fast, ultra flashy black bearings on the outside
• Standard bearing options will include a deshielded standard bearing as spin bearing
Includes a set of finger caps with star design. 
Finger caps will BY DEFAULT be the same color as the frame.
If you would like different color finger caps or custom color combinations of outer bearings, send us a message with your order for NO EXTRA CHARGE!
If you are looking for the best performance money can buy check out our Full Ceramic Bearing Fidget Spinner listing:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/474374640/edc-pro-fidget-spinner-with-full-ceramic
The bearings and finger caps are NOT glued in place, but are pressure fit and very snug. The finger pads can be removed, but due to the pressure fit, the center peg of the finger cover may break off during removal. 
All Spinners with bearings come fully assembled.
We can't guarantee the frame will not crack when installing your own bearings (some brands might have different manufacturing tolerances). Its a tight fit and can be difficult to do properly. We guarantee that the spinners that ship with bearings will not be cracked, as we make sure of it before we send them out.
See the below instructions on how to install bearings and caps. We will not take refunds on frames that were broken during installation of bearings self installed.

10986,"Atari Punk Console Kit, Beginners DIY Electronic Project, Circuit Bent Synthesizer, Noisemaker","
            This Atari Punk Console kit is based on the original Stepped Tone Generator by Forest M. Mimms III. It creates great lo-fi sounds resembling those from the old style Atari games using an astable square wave oscillator.
The main features of the kit are a 9v battery connector snap, an on/off power switch, a 3.5mm jack so that it can be hooked up to other devices such as an amp, speaker or headphones, and two knobs to control the pitch and depth of the quirky raspy tones produced.  
To further customise the Atari Punk Console there are pads for soldering in your own speaker. There is also an extension strip with CV inputs for connecting the APC to other devices such as our Baby 8 Step Sequencer.
This kit is rated as easy, takes around 20-45 mins to make and is suitable for all ages. For safety it is recommended that all children are supervised during assembly!
Each kit contains clearly labelled parts for ease of use. An assembly guide with enlarged diagrams and photos with clear instructions is available to view and download on our website. If you'd prefer to receive this by email or have trouble downloading the instructions please send us a message!
A range of optional extras are available to purchase with this kit including 500mm leaded solder, a small speaker, and a connector kit (consisting of two strips of pin header sockets plus jumper wires) for connecting the APC to devices such as our Baby 8 Sequencer kit. Please use the drop down menus above to add these to your kit.
For orders of more than 10 kits please message to check availability before ordering.

How To Order:
1. Choose your thigh measurement to the nearest inch. See below for instructions on how to measure your thigh.
2. Include your wedding date in the note to seller box on the checkout page so I can ensure a timely delivery.
3.  List your lace color choices in the note to seller box on the checkout page.

How to measure your thigh:
- Garters are usually worn around 4 inches above the knee.
- Wrap a flexible tape measure around your thigh and write down the number where the measuring tape overlaps itself.
- If you don't have a flexible measuring tape, you can wrap a piece of string or ribbon around your thigh and mark the spot where it overlaps. Lay this flat next to a yard stick or ruler to determine the size.
*Garters will not stretch past the measurement given.

12681,"Real PRESSED YELLOW GINGKO Leaves - Perfect for Weddings, Events, Decorations, Art & Craft Projects, Holidays Craft, Biodegradable Decor","
            PRODUCT FEATURES:
• Hand picked by me in Connecticut, New England.
• Preserved using natural preservation methods with no additives in a smoke free environment.
• Contains delicate, pressed flora-fauna, handle with care.
• Avoid placing in direct sunlight to preserve colors.
• Environment friendly materials.
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
Each listing set consists of Real Pressed Yellow Gingko Leaves. You can choose the quantity of leaves from the drop down box during checkout. In addition, I like to see my customers happy so, I always throw in a few extras. 
These leaves are very rarely offered for sale as they have to be given a lot of special attention and care when going through the preservation process. So these are a rare find indeed.
These leaves are handpicked by me from the New England area of the Northeast and quickly pressed to retain the beautiful fall colors. The preservation process is conducted  in a pet, pesticide and smoke free environment. 
PRODUCT USE:
These dried and preserved leaves are just in time for fall weddings, Thanksgiving or Holiday events, decor, or any autumn scrapbooking art and craft project.  
Create Wedding favors, place cards, invitations or thank you notes using these pretty leaves. 
The possibilities are endless if you let your creativity loose.
Sprinkle them around tables, use them for decorating candles, making beautiful note cards or simply tape them to the window glass panes to remind yourself of Fall and its beauty.
SHIPPING & PACKAGING: 
The leaves are delicate, so we package them very carefully. We first lay them on a piece of cardboard and then use plastic wrap to hold them firmly to the cardboard and avoid internal movement. We then use bubble wrap around this package for cushioning. For additional protection during transit, we use a bubble wrap mailer.
 
Please look at our many other varieties and convo or email me if you if you have any special requests or need to order more than one. 
Plenty of stock even though listing displays only one available.        ",14.99,4.3556,"Handmade Supply

14018,Ballpoint or rollerball made of wood with a light spirale ,"
            This pen is made of 18 sliced sycamore  pieces , sawn in such a way that light shines in  spiral around the pen. This phenomenon is not easy to describe, one can see from the pictures clearer places that reflect the light. The curious reader can go to YouTube (by copying the following address in the browser bar) and see a video I made - with a different pen though- which clearly shows the spiral that moves up or down when one turns the pen in his hand.

            This nice vintage Olympus IS-1 35mm camera with built in  flash is in good cosmetic condition. The camera body has fine scratches typical of plastic bodied cameras of this age. The lens looks good, with no scratches or haze.
Made in Japan
Introduced in 1990, I believe that this is the first of a series of similar cameras.
This Olympus IS-1 camera is a good user and will make a nice addition to your vintage camera collection.
Specifications,
.....Film, 35mm
.....Lens, Olympus 35mm-135mm zoom
.....Aperture, f/4.5-f/5.6
.....ISO settings, automatic ( 25-3200 )

.....Original battery, 2, CR123A or DL123A, 3 volt  ( not included )
.....auto focus or manual focus

This camera has manual exposure and manual focus capability. It also has some special modes including macro, night scene and double exposure to name a few. There is a self timer so you can get in the picture. Other settings you can discover for yourself, or just point and shoot.
I tested the camera with expired film ( didn't develope, no pics. ) and it is easy to use. I tried all functions that I could think of and everything worked, including auto film rewind.
I try to give as accurate of a description as possible, but please zoom the pictures to see the condition of the items for yourself.
You get what you see in the pictures,
.....Olympus IS-1 camera with soft case
.....instruction manual ( manual is usable but in rough shape, torn, wrinkled and taped )

Great for starting off sculptural projects.
Comes supplied with three 36 gauge needles. The pen handle unlocks to enable needle switching or replacement.
Also features a clear lid to protect the needles when not in use.
*please note* felting needles are very fragile. ALWAYS work with your fibres on a sponge or felting mat when using the pen. This protect both yourself and the needles. Needle felting directly onto a hard surface will snap the needles and damage the surface.        ",7.63,4.8182,"Craft type: Collage, Embroidery, Felting

* One garland includes: 15 tassels, 5 each of Pink, White and Metallic Gold. Each tassel is about 12"" long after assembled. And each garland comes with a 10ft long FREE gold String for hanging these tassels.

* Improved Finishing - the tissue paper doesn't stick at the ends and it's easier to pull apart.
* To ensure the tassels get to you fresh and new, All TASSELS ARE NOT ASSEMBLED, THEY COME FLAT. (This may take a while to complete, but if you're a crafty person, a few minutes would be ok)

15603,"120 grams silicone Mold Putty for making molds for cake decorating or polymer clay. Make your own silicone mold, food safe silicone","
            This is 120 grams (about 4 ounces) of a two-part silicone mold putty for cake decorating or polymer clay applications. It can be used for isomalt, gumpaste, or non-food materials like resin, soap, and ploymer clays. The silicone is food-grade FDA approved.
To use this you take equal parts of each color and knead them together until there are no more streaks of white and it's a consistent yellow color. Form it around the item that you're molding and let it sit to cure. 
It's about a two to three minute working time before it sets, depending on the temperature. You should have the item to be molded ready to work with, you have to work efficiently but it's very easy to work with!
This is enough to make the groups of molds that are shown in the photos. It's better to measure it with a scale, but if you have to do it by sight and use balls of it that are the same size it's pretty forgiving and you don't have to be 100% accurate for the mold to cure.

Blank Kraft .022 thickness*
This is a CRAFTING CHIPBOARD that works great for displaying headbands, hair ties, ribbon, jewelry & wrapping twine or yarn.     A great thickness for shape cutting that can still be cut with a regular pair of scissors or a guillotine type paper cutter.  If you would like to receive a sample prior to placing a larger order, please convo me.
 
*IMPORTANT NOTES:  EDGES ARE NOT ROUNDED!****  If you would like to round the edges as shown in Photo 1, you can purchase a ""corner punch"" at any craft store or online.  I prefer the Fiskars brand squeeze punch, it is simple and easy to use and lasts through hundreds and hundreds of punches!  Also note that this chipboard is too thick to be fed through a household printer.  It is however, stampable if you have your own logo stamp.

16177,"Pink Ultramarine Pigment Powder 1 Oz or 4 Oz, Pink Soap Color, Pink Mica Powder, Cosmetic Supplies,","
            Pink ultramarine pigment to color your cosmetics and other craft projects. It is approved for general cosmetics including skin and eye products. Matte ultramarine finish, beautiful pink to orchid shade. Use by itself or to deepen the tone of other colors. This powder has been filtered of harmful impurities. Fine particle size range from 0.3 - 1 micron. Color variations depending on the base used. This product is water & oil soluble; may speckle in melt and pour soap. To lessen the speckling, mix well and do not over use. Color will not change in products with a high pH; not light sensitive and will not migrate or bleed between layers.
You choose size of either 1 ounce weight (28 grams), approximately 4 tablespoons by dry measure or 4 ounce weight. Store at room temperature out of direct sunlight in the original zip lock bag or other air tight container. We have used in cold processed, melt and pour and liquid soaps. A little goes a long way. Used at 1/2% this is enough to color 14 pounds of soap base to a mid pink and much more if seeking a pastel shade. Use of vanilla fragrance oils will potentially change finished product after a few weeks; test all recipes in small batches for desired results.
Additional uses in bath fizzies, mineral makeup and other fun projects. Skin and eye safe; not approved for lip products.

---------------------------------
MATERIALS
GOLD-FILLED JEWELRY:
- Under normal wearing conditions and with proper care, your gold filled jewelry should last at least 10 years.
- 14kt Gold-Filled jewelry is made by bonding a solid layer of 14kt gold on top of another metal, but this layer is 1000 - 10,000 times thicker than gold plating, resulting in a durable, long-lasting product that looks gorgeous like solid gold.
- Gold-Filled jewelry can also be worn by people with sensitive skin.
STERLING SILVER:
- We use .925 Sterling Silver, which requires polishing from time to time from oxidation. You can easily restore silver back to shine with a polishing cloth or use a polishing lotion for that extra shine.
---------------------------------

            DETAILS:
**This adjustable wave ring is made with slightly thicker material than what other artists use, allowing for a dainty look that is still sturdy and able to maintain its shape well.**
-Fine materials (sterling silver, 14k gold-filled, and 14k rose gold-filled) - After creating the rings, I tumble harden the jewelry and polish it to a beautiful glistening shine!
-Copper-based materials (gold toned, rose gold toned, silver plated, and turquoise blue) - I hammer harden and polish with a clear coating which provides additional tarnish protection.
 
SIZE: One standard adjustable size. Can request an extra large version which fits better for ring sizes larger than 11.
MATERIAL (hypoallergenic, tarnish-resistant wire):
-14K Gold-Filled (Gold-filled jewelry is made by bonding a layer of 14k gold on top of another metal. This material contains 100 times more gold than gold-plated wire, is very durable, and looks gorgeous like solid gold.)
-14K Rose Gold-Filled
-925 Sterling Silver
-Copper (natural-colored, gold-colored, silver-plated, or turquoise blue on silver-plated)
**See shop policies for more information regarding materials and caring for your jewelry.**
Each ring is made by hand so may differ slightly from the last, but the quality and workmanship are always the best.

            Matte cobalt blue glass drops are the stars of these clip-on earrings.  These 12x5mm frosted glass teardrops are a deep blue that appears lit from within when the light hits them.  I attached them to the ear wires with sterling silver wire.  
The Erie Smooth earrings measure 1 3/8 inches (3.5cm) from the top of the ear wires to the bottom of the teardrops.  I've also included a photo of them in the palm of my hand to help give an idea of their size. 
Choose from simple clip-on ear wires (shown), screw-back clip-on ear wires or lever-back ear wires for pierced ears.  All the ear wire choices are nickle-free, silver-plated brass.

            A tiny flat head L-bend nose stud in three shades of Sterling Silver to choose from: Brushed, Plain, or Oxidized.  This listing is for one (1) nose stud, 22 gauge, with the option to have a set of two (2) or a set of three (3). These nose studs are very small and petite. The flat head is @ 1.5mm. Please see all photos for size comparison and dimension against ruler. 
The plain and brushed Sterling Silver look very, very similar when not under magnification. It is a difference in texture, the brushed Sterling Silver is more matte than the plain Sterling Silver to the normal eye.
Brushed is on the far left, oxidized in the middle, and natural to the right.

18585,Braided Essential Oil Diffuser Bracelet - faux suede,"
            Made To Order - Faux Suede Essential Oil Diffusing bracelet
::DESCRIPTION::
This hand braided bracelet is not only super cute on it's own, but allows you to enjoy the scent of essential oils for hours!  Apply your favorite essential oil onto the bracelet via drops from a bottle or roll on bottle. When the scent fades, you can apply a different scent!
The bracelet is designed with a knot and loop closure. The faux suede will stretch slightly with wear.
::SIZING::
To find your size, measure your wrist in centimeters and then add 1cm for a snug fit or 2cm for a loose fit. 
Tip: If you don't have a flexible measuring tape in centimeters, wrap a piece of nonflexible string or yarn around your wrist and then lay that flat next to a ruler to measure. 
::CARE::
Do not shower with this bracelet or allow it to become submerged in water as it may become damaged. Be aware that lighter shades can become stained with dark essential oils. I recommend applying darker oils to the inside of your bracelet.
::DISCLAIMER::
Buyer assumes all risk and responsibilities for items purchased for children. Be aware of any choking hazards.
Please measure your wrist accurately for correct sizing.
** NEW OPTIONAL LETTER CHARM AVAILABLE!***
3 extra for a stainless steel hand stamped letter charm. Please see the separate listing for the charm and add it to your cart.
