1127,"Unisex Vintage One-Way 3-D Hologram Eye Pendant with Added Link onto Bail - 70s, 80's","
            This gold-tone pendant features a ONE-WAY glass 3-dimensional hologram all seeing eye - it doesn't blink. The ONE-SIDED (back is almost black) hologram exhibits wonderful detailing and the colorations change as it catches the light.  Measures 4cms diameter plus bail. Great for jewellery-making even as the gold-tone could be easily removed.   These were crudely made and the edges can be slightly indifferent but generally fine to wear so you agree to this when purchasing :)
***Photos can bring this up much brighter than it is*** I have added a bail for you to connect your own cord/chain/fob as in photo 1.
The eye hologram on the lens is very beautiful and is yellowish - orange or bluish - green depending on the angle you look at it and the detailing on the eyelashes are amazing - a wonderful piece of art in fact!   
28 elsewhere on this site so grab yourself a bargain!  To the UK this is sent by 2nd class so if you want it quicker please message me.  
Please bear in mind that the colourations are very difficult to capture as a hologram's colours change at each movement!   
This pendant does not include a chain but has a link added to the bail for your cord/chain.        ",8.62,4.9167,"Vintage item from the 1980s

            Vintage Ball & Jacks ~ Set of 6 
c 1940s or 1950s
Great old set of jacks with rubberized wood ball. 
Dating from the 1940s or 1950s. Set comes with
6 thick metal jacks and their original ball. I was
told the ball was wood, so assuming it is rubber
coated wood then.
Ball is about 1.5"" across.
Surprisingly the ball still has a bit of bounce in it,
although probably not recommended to use, these
are highly collectable.
Thanks for viewing.

            Rustic, charming and practical wooden crates
Pretty enough to simply dress a space but practical enough to be used for any number of storage purposes
We use these crates in our own store sat on the floor to display accessories but also have them mounted on the wall as display cases
Use in your own home to store magazines, display your favourite objects or tidy away general household bits n' pieces in a stylish way!
Antique 1950’s and 60’s reclaimed apple crates, known as ‘Bushel Crates, These genuine vintage crates were in regular use up until recently, so they come with a rustic authenticity and no two boxes will be the same. Sizes vary slightly from batch to batch as you would expect with an original product sourced from an array of French farmers! 
Don’t be surprised if there’s the odd blemish of countryside dirt or century old cobwebs – we won’t be washing these crates; perfection isn’t always perfect, and their weathered appearance creates a charm we wouldn’t want to mess with. As a visual merchandising solution apple crates are perfect within a retail environment, but also a highly sought after gift for domestic home use.
They measure 50cm x 40cm x 30cm

To protect your skin from razor bumps and ingrown hairs, apply after a clean shave. Or use daily after cleansing. If using to treat razor bumps, apply to affected area daily after cleansing. Expect to see positive results within a week. For all skin types.
SOME SATISFIED CUSTOMERS
----------------------------------------
★★★★★ Works both as a preventive measure as well as treatment for an existing razor burn. It soothes the existing bumps and prevents new ones from appearing. I use it on my bikini line and my boyfriend uses it after shaving. All around great product.
★★★★★ Use this all the time…best thing for razor bumps. Remember to apply it RIGHT after your first shave…that’s the most important. Depending on the severity of the bumps and/or how quickly you want to get rid of them, you can apply this once in the morning or at night until the bumps disappear.
★★★★★ I have experienced neck bumps from shaving and ingrown hairs for 15  years. They are now a thing of the past because of this item. My dermatologist could not help me with the several different prescription medication. — My suggestions / buy one, test as instructed (small area of skin for 24 hours), if no allergic reaction start using 2 times per day – Once after shaving in AM and apply at night after washing face for bed. I noticed the improvement within 3 days
★★★★★ I’ve purchased these before and a small amount of use will quickly bring about results. A good product to have on hand.
★★★★★ This stuff rocks. I used to get razor burn in my bikini area, but now it’s under control.
★★★★★ This product works pretty well in case your having a flare up of scalp folliculitis like I do sometimes. I also use it after shaving sometimes to reduce irritation. Good product for the price.
★★★★★ Very good product that always produces good results for me. I get bumps quite frequently from ingrown hairs. This helps to control it nicely.        ",7.95,4.8,"Handmade item

Spotless, pristine condition.  Worn once and carefully hand washed and stored in a wardrobe with a clothes cover.
Vibrant royal blue and bright white with large faux pearl buttons to the jacket.
Fine straw boater style hat with wide satin ribbon trim. 
The size is to fit 36"" - 38"" bust.  Both the jacket and the dress measure 19"" from underarm to underarm with a little extra for the fullness of the bust.  The jacket measures 22.5"" from the shoulder and the dress 44.5"" also from the shoulder.  
Expertly made by a professional dressmaker.
  My mannequin is about 5ft 9in tall and 34"" 24"" 34"" so this is a little big on her - especially on the hips.

16114,Hush-Hush/Violet Holographic/ Holo Indie Nail Polish,"
            This polish is part of Hidden Depths Collection. This listing is for a 9ml Violet holo polish called Hush-Hush. The holographic effect is so strong that it doesn't need sun to show up. The photos above are taken indoor with and with out flash and under a lamp with cool daylight and in natural daylight.
Two coats of polish and no top coat is applied to achieve the result in the photos.
All my polish bases are 5 free - They do not contain camphor, toulene, formaldehyde, dibutyl phthalate (DBP), or formaldehyde resins.
Each nail polish contains 100% stainless steel balls which do not contain zinc so it will not discolor the nail polish.
Tips for applying:
. Apply the second coat only when the first coat is dry.
. Use top coat to seal the polish for long wear.
While I do my very best to ensure the pictures match the real colour of the polish, please note that colours can appear different on different computer screens. 
Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions!        ",6.22,4.9167,"Handmade item
