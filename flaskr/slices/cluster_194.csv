with organic clove oil for superb oral care.
1.3 oz  Use 3-4 times a week, or twice daily if needed. Safe for ages 10 and up.
NOW AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT FLAVORS!!!!!!! YAY (SEE CHOICES UP ON THE RIGHT)
WARNINGS:
ACTIVATED CHARCOAL IS BLACK AND CAN STAIN CERTAIN SURFACES (TEMPORARILY). MY SUGGESTION IS NOT TO USE YOUR EXPENSIVE ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH, GET A REGULAR DISPOSABLE ONE. AND ALSO, MUST BE USED REGULARLY EVERY DAY FOR WHITENING EFFECTS. RESULTS ARE USUALLY SHOWN 1 WEEK FROM START, OR EARLIER. BUT YOUR TOTAL ORGANIC ORAL CARE STARTS FROM THE MINUTE YOU BEGIN. 
DIRECTIONS: MUST BE STORED AT ROOM TEMP. IF IT GETS TOO WARM IT WILL LIQUIFY DUE TO THE COCONUT OIL. IF THIS HAPPENS PLACE IN THE FRIDGE A FEW MINUTES THEN STIR WITH A TOOTHPICK. DO NOT USE METAL.  DIP TOOTHBRUSH INTO PASTE AND BRUSH LIKE NORMAL, LONGER YOU LET IT SIT, THE MORE STAINS ARE LIFTED FROM THE CHARCOAL, I USUALLY LET SIT ABOUT 3 MINUTES, THEN RINSE WITH WARM WATER ABOUT 4-5 TIMES TO GET ALL THE BLACK OUT. AFTER YOU CAN USE YOUR NORMAL PRODUCTS IF DESIRED. RINSE YOUR SINK OR WIPE DOWN WITH SOAP. ALL CLEAN:)        ",5.85,4.9429,"Handmade item
