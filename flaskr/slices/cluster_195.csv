            Calligraphy Dip Pen, 1st to 16th Century. This Calligraphy Dip Pen is based on several in European museums. These pens are documented from 100 AD to 1600 AD and beyond.  This pen in particular is patterned after one that has been dated to about the 16th century, this is a wonderful gift for the calligraphers you know or as a gift to yourself! 
Each pen is shipped with a small section of sheep's wool to use as a reservoir for the ink. (a very small piece needs to be put inside the pen so it can feed ink to the split between the tines.)
Each pen is handmade from brass, is about 120 mm long, 5 mm wide at the widest.  The tip of the nib is about 1 mm wide.
As they are handmade, they will have some variations in length and width and nib width.
Be aware that calligraphers who purchase this should be skilled in finishing and adjusting dip pen nibs. Each pen is finished and ready to use but each calligrapher will need to adjust it to fit the way they write.
