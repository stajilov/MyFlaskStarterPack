Rustic Pattern
The Rustic pattern is perfect as it reflects the most natural form of leather with optimum thickness. It just underlines the fact that what you have is real leather.
Some design patterns we use on leather, e.g. Antic, might have slight markings and scratches. This is a characteristic of this pattern and provides uniqueness of your product, just like fingerprints. These markings are not deemed as faults; they dull down quickly and provide authentic and vintage appearance for your leather product.
Care:This Wallet skin surface is cleaning with a leather oil and velvet fabric and please allow to dry for 15 minutes in a moist environment.

5664,Vintage 1940s Black Felt Hat Wide Brim Ladies Hat 1940s Ladies Hat Vintage 40s Floppy Hat,"
            This hat measures 22.5"" inside. This is an average size. Condition: great, a little dusty but no moth nibbles. There may have been a veil at some point in the past as there is a small amount of it on the inside of the brim.
HOW TO WORK OUT YOUR HAT SIZE : To find out your hat size, you must measure your head. Using a tape measure, measure your head about one-half inch above your eyebrows where your hat will rest. Be certain that the tape measure is straight, not twisted or you can use piece of string to measure your head then measure the length of the string with a ruler. If you are not certain about size, or are between sizes, buy the larger size.
Great black hat in soft felt (possibly doeskin?). Wide brim which is narrower at the back. Can be worn at the back of the head like a halo or pulled down at the front. Very elegant and stylish.        ",66.33,4.9286,"Vintage item from the 1940s

--------------IMPORTANT NOTICE FIRST SALE OF THE YEAR  SEE ABOVE-------
This is a standing bracelet holder, meant to stand on a dresser or bureau or other flat surface. It is made of oak, stained golden oak and finished with 2 coats of clear lacquer. 
The supporting holder is 17"" wide, 13"" tall, and is about 6 inches deep. (Add about 1 1/2"" on each side when the wands are in place) It has 3 removable wands for holding the bracelets, and each one will hold 30 bracelets, depending on size. Less wide ones, more narrow ones. 
How does this work? You place the bracelets on the bars, and then place the bars on the rack. One on top, one in the middle, and one on the bottom.
 To remove a bracelet, grab one of the wands by the larger knob, remove it from the unit, and slide off the bracelets up to the one that you want, remove that one, and slide the others back on. If you don't have full wands, you can slide them from one wand to the other instead of taking them off. The small balls on the ends of the wands help to keep the bracelets from sliding off the end. It sounds complicated, but it is really easy to do. The best part is all of your beautiful bracelets are on display all of the time for you to enjoy them.
If you have a lot of rings, we can substitute the top wand for one that will hold rings. It is a smaller diameter, and the smaller ball on the end will pass thru a size 7 ring. If you would like a ring wand instead of the top bracelet wand, just let us know in a message or a note when you go thru checkout. If you need to hold smaller size rings, let us know the smallest size, down to size 5 and we will sand the ball down enough to accommodate that size. No additional cost if you choose a ring wand.

We have enabled calculated shipping for this item, with the idea of giving you a choice on shipping services, and giving you the ability to choose the least expensive shipping that that is available. There are NO handing charges added on, just the straight postage. If you are combining this item with another one, the program sometimes gets way out of whack. If the combined shipping charges are more than it would be to ship the items separately, please send us a message and we will check out the charges and let you know. We do NOT want you to be paying more for shipping than you should.
To see what the shipping for this item will be, click on the Shipping tab just under the main picture. You will have to enter your zip code. If the computer does it for you, check that it is the right one.   
Shown in the picture is the Golden Oak stain.  This is the default color, but you will still need to choose if from the  drop down menu if you would like it.  These can also be had in several different stain colors. You can pick from any one of the stain choices shown, no extra cost.  You WILL need to make a color choice to continue with the purchase process.  The drop down menu is at the top of the page, just above the ADD TO CART button
Just let us know which one you want, and be prepared to wait a FEW EXTRA DAYS for delivery for other that the Golden Oak or unfinished because we don't have each and every one always ready to go. 
Also, the finish listed as natural is actually unfinished, raw wood, nothing added, and is primarily for those who would like to stain or paint their own.

The doggie's head and bum can be of taupe, soft grey, rusty red, chocolate brown, black or peanut brown plush - you can choose your favorite option. Please take a look at the last picture for the colors.
Puppy on the first picture (ANDREA) is taupe and second picture (I<3YOU) is grey. These colors are very near to each other, taupe is just a little brownish.
****************
Important notice:
Availability of soft grey and chocolate brown puppies is limited. Unfortuntely I can't get those colors anymore. Now I do have fabrics for some puppies, though.
Last 3 choco and 5 grey puppies are available - these colors won't be available anymore
****************
The middle section of the body is made of some colorful canvases. I always try to keep the colors in harmony. If you would like to have a special color scheme then please convo me!
I can make the body as long as it needed - I make a section for each letter of your name. Each section is 7 cm (2 3/4 inches) wide. The actual doggie (with my own name) is 80 cm (31,5 inches) long and 25 cm (10 inches) tall.
He is filled with high quality polyfill. Machine washable and tumble dryable.
The eyes are embroidered, except for the black dog which has safety button eyes (embroidery would disappear on black plush)
The price of the doggie depends on the lenght (the number of the letters on his body) The basic price is for 4 letters (66 cm - 26"" long doggie). The maximum lenght is 10 letters (however it would be more than 1 meter!).
If you would like to order your own doggie then please write the desired name to the remark field of your order.
If you have any further questions, please send me a convo! If you would like to have a doggie with some particular colors of canvases, please send me a convo, too!        ",42.00,4.9866,"Handmade item

            A really nice copy of the Ladybird Children's Classic book ""The Wind in the Willows"" by Kenneth Grahame, retold for easy reading by Joan Collins. It is a gloss hardback book published in 1983.
It has 51 pages, most with colour illustrations, and lovely illustrated front endpapers ( see photo 2).
The book is in very good vintage condition with no creases or tears. There are just a couple of small brown marks near the inner spine between the inside front covers and the next couple of pages (see photos 2 and 3). The top corner of the front cover is slightly bent inwards (see photo 1).
Book measures  7 x 4.5in / 18 x 11cm.
Enjoy adventuring with Toad, Ratty, Mole and Badger in the pages of this delightful book.

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:
*****************************************
*Please don't be surprised: these are TINY adorable little wood hearts, measuring about 12mm. People adore them! The doily they are sitting on is only 4"" around, so you get an idea of the size of the hearts.
*First 2 pictures depict the current color I'm selling. Since they are wood, every time I reorder, there is a variation and I take a new picture. 
*Please note that due to the fact that they are laser cut out of wood, variations in wood colors may vary depending on the wood used to cut them. 
* I strongly recommend that you buy all you need at one time so you don't get different wood lots if you purchase at different times. You will always get matching wood cut from the same grain when ordered in one lot, but if you order at different times, there may be variations in color and sometimes even in size.

            WIDE FLAT NOSE WUBBERS
The jaws on these pliers are wider than most, providing an extra secure grip. The finish makes them less likely to slip when working with metal and helps prevent marring your piece. 
These pliers are heavy-duty enough to handle heavier gauge wire (such as 12 and 14 gauge), but precise enough to accomplish work of a much finer nature. They measure 6.5 inches long and the handles are comfortable and give plenty of leverage and control--won't leave your hands feeling 20 years older. The spring provides smooth action as you work. 
We especially like these pliers for coiling heavier gauge wire. You will welcome Wubber's Wide Flat Nose Pliers to your work bench! 
 
The jaws of the Wide Flat Nose Wubber Pliers taper from 7.3mm down to 6.5mm at the tip.        ",24.99,4.9494,"Ships worldwide from  United States

I am a fanatic knitter and I love to crochet, as you can see from my jewelry store in my profile. Therefore I know that this would make a great gift, or wedding gift, for those knitters you love or just buy it for yourself. I am the designer of this and all the art deco handmade accessories found in this shop.
You just place the yarn ball in the bowl and pull the thread through the slot as you knit. The bowl will keep the ball from rolling across the floor, out of your kitty's playful paws, and it will twist and turn in the bowl as it gets unraveled while you knit! Cute and Dreamy and useful too!
This design has multiple holes in the shape of leaves as you can see from the detail photo to the side, so that you can work with 2 different balls of yarn.  Made from recycled, reclaimed upcycled eco friendly clay.
--------------------------
As a pleased repeat customer says in her feedback: ""Beautiful colors and I love this new size. It's still quite large! Thanks for another beautiful work of art!""
Here is some recent feedback left by another satisfied customer:
""It's so beautiful! It's so useful! It's already supporting a scarf underway. It's bigger than I thought but then I hadn't thought too hard about the size that it would be to contain two balls. I'm using the open slit and it guides the yarn without snagging. Very well made, wonderful glaze and a very pretty cutout design. Thanks so much!""
""am constantly losing my yarn when crocheting. This bowl is GREAT!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE it and the colors are gorgeous! thanks!!!""

16784,Beauty and the beast necklace - Emma watsons  Belle's lariat choker red / burgundy rope necklace movie 2017 easter gift idea,"
            Read full description - 2-3 weeks before shipping I'm working as fast I can  . Vegan version available in my shop as well . 
If you need earlier for a gift . Leave me a note at checkout and also message me AFTER purchase so I can add you to my rush list. 
All my credit card orders are processed through PayPal , so choose PayPal at checkout and you can use your credit card you don't need PayPal account actually , It's very simple !
Made when ordered ! I'm very busy with orders! These take time to make and Bead. 
This lariat choker necklace was inspired by Belle's (Emma Watsons) Leather lariat necklace worn in the 2017 live action movie. I repeat inspired!!!  not an exact replica , It's my original version ! 
This is my original design you won't find anywhere else . I hand make everyone myself ! 
 I take a real natural leather burgundy / reddish ( it's more red then it photographs ) chord and a metallic brass  Glass beads. They are gorgeous in real life . then I hang three smaller brass or glass beads hanging below to mimic Belles necklace to create a necklace similar to Belle's, almost identical from what I can tell . 
Things to know : it's leather so you will need to wear and let it relax after being rolled up in box during shipping . Could be a little stiff after traveling 
Do not shower in it obviously 
It's a choker lariat so it will be close to the neck and drop low around cleavage area like in the last pic . 
1.
Measurements 
The choker is based on the average neck size of a woman 13 inches the drop with Bead hangs about 2 -4 inches  from throat ! 
The large Bead is 18mm so about the size of a nickel . Look at pictures . 
2. If for a child leave me a note so I can make and inch or two smaller . 
You must message me or leave a note in the notes to seller section at checkout ! 
If you need it shorter because you are ordering for a child or you are super small and want  it to fall on the high upper chest area leave me a note at checkout! 
Checkout my smaller version I have Listed it's a petite version . 
Checkout my other version in my shop using a vintage brass bell charm to re-create the look! It's super cute!
