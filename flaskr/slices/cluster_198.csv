            This unique, soft looking vase is one of a kind. Each vase is made on the pottery wheel and although they all have the same ""look and feel"" they are different from one another in the way the folding occurs and the spiral line that surrounds it. At the end, the outcome is random. This is one of the things I enjoy in this piece.

13911,MOLLIE - Nude colour lace Bridesmaid Shift Dress - Nude matt duchess satin and peach lace - Size small - Size 10 - simple bridesmaid dress,"
            Hello!
I‚Äôm Anna, a designer and dressmaker based near Brighton in the UK. I design and make every dress here in my home studio at the seaside for my bridal wear label; ‚ÄòThis Modern Love‚Äô. 
About This Modern Love
The aesthetic for ‚ÄòThis Modern Love‚Äô is romantic, feminine, bohemian and beautifully simple dresses, all hand crafted using the finest materials such as silk chiffon, corded lace, duchess satin and soft tulle.  My dresses are designed in a delicate colour palette including of ivory, nude and blush tones, though lots more colours are available.
All of my dresses are a relaxed, pull on style which cinch in at the waist with elastic - they are not structured or fitted. Because of this, my designs feel comfortable, lightweight and fluid. My customers are often women looking for a relaxed, vintage style or bohemian dress, with a woodland, rustic or festival theme to their wedding: brides looking for something simple, beautiful and original.
Highlights for This Modern Love
Named as ‚ÄòThe One to Watch‚Äô in Perfect Wedding Magazine (Apr 2016)

About this dress
MOLLIE BRIDESMAID DRESS
A pretty and elegant bridesmaid dress. Made in a nude coloured matt duchess satin, the top of the dress has a layer of pretty peach/blush coloured lace and little scallop edge cap sleeves. Finished with a pretty grosgrain ribbon tied at the waist.
Simple and beautiful. Perfect for a relaxed, modern wedding. Ideal as bridesmaid or flower girl dress.
(Model is 5ft 11 and sz 10)
Only one dress available.
A scoop neck design at the front and the back of the dress (the back scoop is slightly higher than the front).
Like all This Modern Love dresses, this design is a simple, unstructured pull on design. It simply pulls on over the head and cinches at the waist with elastic, there are no fastenings, zips etc. The design is relaxed and non fitted. 
Ready to wear dresses
This listing is for the dress pictured in the photographs, it‚Äôs a ‚Äòready to wear‚Äô dress which means that the dress is the size listed only. This style is not currently available as a ‚Äòmade to order/bespoke‚Äô dress as the fabric used to create it is no longer available.
Want to try it on? That‚Äôs absolutely fine! You‚Äôre welcome to order the dress to try it and if it‚Äôs not suitable then you can return the dress for a full refund. Returns must be notified within a strict 7 day period of the receipt of the dress. I‚Äôm sorry, but postage costs are non refundable.

All jewelry is hand stamped. Hand stamping is a method which involves each letter, design, punctuation etc being stamped by hand using a brass mallet against stainless steel block.
It is often confused with engraving or machine imprinted but that is far from the case!
It is a time consuming process which takes patience and skill.
Because of the hand made nature of my stamped jewellery, some letters may not be 100% perfectly aligned or all the same depth.
This is not a fault, it is the nature of the hand stamping method and add uniqueness to each piece of jewellery.

            NEW DESIGNS!
My latest handmade reworked Adidas Style Fashion Bikini or Lingerie set.
This is made from a soft but thick scuba fabric. Would recommend after each dip in sea water or pool to rinse in clear water to remove all residue and prolong wear.
It is beautifully structured and has a flattering cut for all shapes.
I make these to order so please allow 5 days production time before shipping.
Please read the sizes below to fit top and bottoms and measure your underbust to get your band size. If your band does not match your cup size, then you will need to request a custom order which would incur a 10% price increase. Hips are measured at widest part.
XS - UK 6 - 8 Bottoms to fit 32 - 34' hips = Under Bust Band size 27.5"" AA - A/B Cup
S - UK 8 - 10 Bottoms to fit 34 - 36' hips = Under Bust Band Size 28.5"" B/C Cup

20100,Monogrammed Crossbody Clutch | Faux Leather Clutch | Ladies' Crossbody | Monogram Clutch | Monogram Wristlet Wallet | Monroe,"
            The Monroe is our monogrammed crossbody clutch that boasts loads of organization.  The faux leather bag can be worn as a crossbody purse, grabbed as a clutch, or thrown on your wrist with the wristlet strap. With a total of 4 compartments, there is plenty of storage for all of the necessities. The bag unzips to store cash and your larger items like phones, glasses, lip stick, and keys. The two larger compartments frame the center to hold 6 card slots and a great place for receipts. Between the card holders you will find an internal zipper pocket to collect your change.  This purse has been a lifesaver for women on-the-go. It's not too bulky to wear crossbody and it's the perfect size to throw into any larger purse, tote, or diaper bag. The Monroe is the favorite purse of every one of our friends! 
Embroidered with a 2"" inch monogram.
