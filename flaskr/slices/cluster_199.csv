2866,"Flowers, world postage stamps | modern  vintage random floral mixed used stamps | crafting, collage, upcycling, decoupage, collecting","
            Packet of 20 or 40 Used World Postage Stamps
Flower / Floral Theme Mix, including vintage & more recent
You will receive a random selection of used stamps, all featuring some form of flowers, blossoms, petals or floral arrangement.  Packets may or may not include the exact stamps shown (picture is a representative sampling of my currently available selection but this will be added to regularly).  I will avoid duplicates in any single packet, but there will be duplication if multiple packets purchased at one time.  
Stamps are mostly pre-1996 although there may be one or two more recent, and one or two much older than others. The mix you receive will be randomly selected from those available, but I will try to include a range of different countries.  
Stamps are in good condition, most are used & postmarked although there may be one or two mint unused.  Great for adding an authentic international travel flavour to your upcycled craft projects, greeting cards, scrapbooking etc.  All stamps in each packet are off paper, ready to use/craft (not valid for use as actual postage!)
* * * * *
I use stamps regularly in my own artwork (see my shop: 
http://tanglecrafts.etsy.com
 ).  These packets are made up from the excess which do not fit my own projects - a continual process of sorting & filtering, which means new stamps are frequently added into the mix.  Just a way to keep these otherwise unloved stamps in circulation! 
Please: see my other listings for more themed & mixed used postage stamp packets:

 -Brushed Steel - A bright polished finish, similar to stainless steel. 
All are topped with a durable crystal clear coat.  Mounting screws included

RE:  SHIPPING CHARGES BEING TOO HIGH
------------------------------------
~*~ WHEN YOU BUY SEVERAL ITEMS from me, the shipping amounts aren't always correct with the Etsy invoicing system.  In most cases it does cost less!
 
~*~  I WILL ALWAYS REFUND ANY OVER CHARGES FOR SHIPPING/HANDLING
 
~*~ FOR FASTEST SHIPPING BY ME, place your order & pay for it, that way I will ship your item right away then send you a shipping refund in the event that the shipping/handling is less.
 
~*~ If you do not like this method, put the order through BUT DO NOT PAY and request a final invoice from me via Etsy Conversation (email) & I will take care of this for you!        ",7.45,4.9795,"Craft type: Jewelry making, Stained glass

            This listing is for 50 charms and beads, the mix is random and every bag will vary, you will get no more than 2 of each charm / bead.  Mostly pairs but there will be some odd beads and charms, sizes vary.  The photo is an example of what you could get but the mix you get will be different - I have many different themes in the packs.
The charms are tibetan silver style alloy metal, they're antique silver in colour.
These charms are nickel and lead free.
Photos are close up to show detail and are not to scale.
These are clearance packs at a special reduced price, once they are all sold they will not be restocked.
