            Oh my, this is the loveliest antique 'Poodle' rocking horse I have ever met..
It is made in the fifties and in absolutely wonderful antique condition - with little wear, consistent with use and age.
This rocking poodle has all the original parts, including the handles, saddle and collar - even the eyes and eyelashes are original. It is obvious that this dog has been well-loved and has been softly played and cuddled with.
The poodle measures 104 cm (including the metal frame) x 45 cm x 76 cm (measured from the ground to the top of the dog's head) or 41"" x 17.7"" x 30"".
Please do not hesitate to send me a message if you would like to see more (detailed) pictures. :) I'm more than happy to help!        ",222.07,4.9524,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            Steiff Cosy teddy bear 60s vintage caramel Dralon plush bear with white bib & open mouth, 8 inch small, highly collectible Steiff animal
Here is a rare vintage Steiff Cosy teddy bear, produced in this version from 1968 to 1976 & hard to find! Steiff Cosy Teddy here is one of the small version, 8 inches / 20 cm tall, made of caramel coloured Dralon plush with white bib, fully jointed, open mouth, plastic eyes & embroidered nose. Cosy Teddy is stuffed with rubber foam & fully washable.
Sadly he lost his ear button, (hence the very reasonable price) & his bow was added by me. Apart from this he is all original & his condition is very good – only on the bridge of his nose he lost some fur over time. Steiff Cosy Teddy would make the darling bear in every Steiff or bear collection & shabby decoration toy lovers should not think twice about giving him a new home!
*Please notice: This old Steiff teddy bear belongs not into the hands of children; it may not fulfil the safety standards for toys in our time! So it is not meant as a toy, though an adult collector’s item for display and decoration only!

            1996 Curly Beanie Baby, Ty Beanie Babies Rare, Curly Beanie Baby With Errors
You are looking at a very rare version of the Curly Beanie Baby Bear. 
Curly the Bear is new and has never been played with.
He has been in a plastic ziploc bag in a container for the last 20 years.
Curly Bear's fur is the less common nappy texture, rather than plush.
There were only 1,000,000 Curly Beanie Babies made.
This Curly Beanie Baby With Errors was born April 12, 1996 and has the following errors:
 
1.    He has a brown nose.
​2.   His Ty Beanie Baby swing tag has the misspelling  ""origiinal"" versus ""original""
      in the yellow star on the front of the Beanie Baby tag.
​3.  There is an extra space of the poem after the to, ""To   this bear""
4.  On the back of the Beanie Baby swing tag ""surface"" was misspelled ""suface"", and a sticker was placed over the tag to correct 
     the spelling before it left the factory.
5.  Curly Bear doesn't have any stamp in his Tush Tag, which dates him prior to May of 1998 when the stamp was added to all of 
     the tush tags.
6.  Not that I'm sure if it matters, but his Tush Tag says 1993, and his birthday year is 1996 . 
     At least he was copyrighted before he was born.
 
​He is Handmade in China, and has PE Pellets.
This Curly Beanie Baby was purchased at a Candy Kitchen in Delaware at the beach.
The pictures are of the exact Curly Beanie Baby that you will receive.  They are taken with a high resolution camera.
The shipping is free and Curly Bear will be shipped USPS Express Mail.
I do ship within 24 hours of receiving payment, with most times being the same day.  All of my items are packed with care.

2416,"Roman Glass Beads, Silk Road Roman Glass, Rectangular Ancient Roman Glass Beads, Mineral Patina Glass Beads, 1 Bead Strand kbdesignsetc","
            ROMAN GLASS BEADS, a.k.a. Silk Road Beads, Rare Roman Glass Beads, Rectangular / Square Shaped Roman Glass Beads, Roman Glass Patina Beads, Ancient Roman Glass Bead Spacer Beads AR150
These rare and ancient Roman glass pieces are from around the 1st century or even earlier (i.e. B.C.), an unbelievably long time ago! 
Originally, these glass pieces were a part of a bowl, a goblet, a pitcher, some type of utilitarian vessel. They belong to the actual, every day existence and activities of Roman life. 
These vessels became buried over time.  The vast majority have, naturally, broken into pieces. 
A portion of these glass fragments have been made into beads. Every bead has individuality. The beads vary in color, patina, mineralization, dimensions, surface character...===  all adding up to the beads that we love, appreciate and covet.
Being in the ground for this long period of time has allowed these pieces to develop unique mineral patinas.
** THIS LISTING IS FOR ONE STRAND. 
** UNIQUE- Please note: the strands that we offer include Roman GLASS SPACER BEADS (we do not substitute; ALL the beads on these strands are made from genuine, remarkably old, unearthed glass).
The glass has sat for centuries, unfound, in the soil and ground. Therefore, much of the glass has collected mineral deposits. These mineral deposits have become the beautiful, opalescent patinas that we now see on these ancient glass beads. The patina the beads have acquired over the centuries is natural, highly variable and, at times, absolutely stunning!
** THIS LISTING IS FOR A SINGLE STRAND OF ROMAN GLASS FRAGMENT BEADS THAT ARE RECTANGULAR / SQUARE IN SHAPE. THE BEADS ARE BLUE, GREEN, AQUA, BROWN, YELLOW… SOME WITH PATINA, SOME ARE CLEAR. THEY ARE FREQUENTLY TEXTURED AND/OR WITH VARIATIONS IN SHAPE. EACH and EVERY BEAD IS UNIQUE.
The patina/mineralization of the beads can offer wonderful small flashes of color. You might see pink, green, red, blue...  These color flashes, in some of the patinas, will vary in different lighting; they resemble opals or labradorite etc...
** Approximately 14 - 21 ancient glass beads per strand which measure approximately 14 x 10 x 8 to 9 x 7 x 4 mm, PLUS the spacer beads that are approximately 3 x 5 mm rondelles. VARIATION in bead quantity does exist between the strands (however, the length of the beads on any selected strand remain, generally, equal to each other). Each bead is unique, no two pieces are exactly alike, therefore every strand is one of a kind.
The beads are cut from a variety of different ancient glass vessels. 
 The age of the glass ranges from 900 to 2700 years old.
*** YOUR BEAD STRAND/S WILL BE CHOSEN AT RANDOM FROM OUR INVENTORY***
We offer a variety of additional shaped ancient glass bead strands. Please ask.
All photographs have been taken outdoors using only natural sunshine, dry stones/beads and my close-up camera lens.

2838,75 Vintage Worldwide Postage Stamps for Philately Crafts Decoupage Resin Art Pendant Art Some MINT Some Never Hinged,"
            Stamps are such perfect miniature paintings and can be useful for various craft projects, clip art, jewelry making, decoupage etc or if you are an avid philatelist. You'll receive 75 stamps, most from overseas starting with A nations to the Z end of the alphabet! I throw in extras with each order. I'm always getting new lots so if you've ordered before, the mix is always changing! Very few stamps are from the United States; some are not metered and never hinged in mint condition with very interesting art and designs. There are some collectible stamps if you are a serious philatelist, not just cto's for scrapbook, crafts or jewelry making. If you are a serious philatelist, check out my worldwide listing for mostly pre-1960's stamps, some from the late 1800's.
Stamps range in size from under one inch to up to several inches. Many stamps in the lots have flowers, birds, characters from history and fiction and depict important moments in history and most are from the 20th century. This is a super good lot of stamps from ALL OVER and definitely some unusual ones! I hand sort to make sure you will get a variety of types and sizes. I cull out any stamps that don't meet my standards such as creased, bent corners, ripply from not being dried flat enough etc. I offer those at discount rate for jewelry/craft use periodically, ask me if I have some and I'll check my envelope stash. I ship flat between light cardboard, shipping in US is 1.00, Canada and elsewhere is 2.50.        ",7.00,4.9524,"Vintage Supply

3951,Vintage Black Leather Coach Handbag // Coach Dinky Bag // Distressed Leather Coach Cross Body Purse // Made in USA,"
            Vintage distressed black leather Coach dinky handbag. Really cute cross body style that fits just the essentials- small wallet, iphone in case, and a pen. This bag is heavily distressed and worn. Corners and edges have wear and holes. What is great is that this is the vintage leather Coach style with leather piping edges so that when the edges wear down like this, its just leather than shows and none of that plastic tubing of the later years. Scratches, dings and marks all over.
Marked made in USA
does not include original hang tag
Measures approximately:
6 x 9 x 2.25""

            Nifty vintage green canvas military mail collection bag..probably from the Viet Nam war era..the bag folds down on itself and stores away nicely.  There is a piece of plywood attached at the top with the eye hooks and wire frame to provide a slot for mail to be placed.  It can also be locked for security.  
** it is 23"" tall 16"" wide and 9"" deep.
It shows some wear due to age and use.  I can still be used for original purpose and can be converted into something else.  The plywood can be removed (it is currently nailed in place with small tacks) and it can be a hanging bag for storage or laundry or what ever!

I pack every item with great care and I send it within 1-2 working days. If you are sending it as a present I am happy to enclose I card which I can write for you.
If you are ordering from UK, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, I can send by Mondial Relay, which makes the shipping charge cheaper, and is still delivered direct to your home address. If you are ordering from France I also use Mondial Relay, and this becomes very cheap, if you don’t mind collecting from a Point Relais. If you would rather have the item delivered to your home, let me know and I can send via Collissimo which is a higher cost. If you want to purchase several items together, I can recalculate you a better shipping price, where practical, just contact me in advance.
Do not hesitate to ask me for more information, I will be very pleased to help you, and I like to please my customers.

5236,"Iittala Glasses Ultima Thule by Tapio Wirkkala, Finnish Designer, Mid-20th Century Classic - Set of Four Iittala Glasses in Original 60s Box","
            This set of four Iittala ""Ultima Thule"" glasses by the Finnish designer Tapio Wirkkala is in excellent original and unused condition. These classic Finnish glasses are mould blown, and were produced in 1968. You will see copies in top design shops that may cost more! These glasses are original and will hold their value, especially if you keep the box.
Ultima Thule is an evocation of the patterns nature gives to frozen water. Its tactile, textured surface overcomes the problems of machine-made glass and communicates a delicious sensation of cold by its frosted appearance.
These original collectible glasses can sell for up to 68 AUD each on Etsy or Ebay. This is a rare, intact set of four in the original foam box inside the original cardboard outer container, and in a vintage shop would cost much more than my price.
The height of each glass is 2.8 inches (7cm), and the diameter at the widest point is 2.8 inches (7cm).
Any excess postage costs will be refunded: PLEASE SEE MY POLICIES STATEMENT.        ",125.00,4.9524,"Vintage item from the 1960s

I see a very small flea bite along the bottom side edge, and a scratch on the back. Measures about 5.75"" long, 4.25"" tall, and 1.5"" thick.

            Here I have filled a shadow box with vintage cowboys and indians , and wild west images.  The cowboys and Indians are circa 1960, and there are also images culled from vintage cowboy books and some western style fabric showing wagon wheels, cacti etc. The wooden tray measures 12 x 8"" and has been hand stained. The wooden tray measures 12 x 8"" . The piece stands nicely on a shelf or mantle but it would be easy to attach a hook to the rear if you would prefer to hang it.  All the items are securely fixed in to the tray, so it is ready to display.
This would make a lovely addition to a boy's bedroom, or a man cave. With its western theme it makes a great piece of Ranch decor also.
I love curating and making these little mood boxes, and have several others in my store, please take a look!  If there is a particular theme or style hat you are interested in I am happy to take on a custom project, so please convo me .        ",33.15,4.9481,"Vintage handmade item from the 1960s

5344,Vintage Carousel Horse Music Box - replica Looff c. 1911,"
            This is a distinctive figurine of a carousel horse done in the style of Charles I.D. Looff circa 1911. The white horse is detailed in shades of blue, and the hand painting has been done with great attention to detail. 
The horse is secured by a brass pole to a wooden base on which a nameplate is affixed: Looff c. 1911
Looff was a famous carnival American master carver and builder of hand-carved carousels and amusement rides in the late 1800s and early 1900s. He became known for creating the Coney Island style of carousel carving. 
Unfortunately the music box function does not work. (Maybe a handy person will be able to repair it.)
On the bottom we have a label saying Impulse Giftware Made in Taiwan.
Size: Base is 5 1/4 inches long; 3 1/4 inches wide; and stands 1 1/2 inches tall. The horse figurine is approximately 4 7/8 inches long (from knee to tail); about 1 1/2 inches wide; and stands about 5 1/2 inches tall (excluding the base).
Condition: Very good vintage condition. You can see a few small nicks in the wooden base - please look carefully at the photos. And as mentioned, the music box doesn't play. But the figurine itself is in excellent condition -- no cracks, chips, repairs, or flaws. Give it a little gentle cleaning and polish up the brass pole and you will have a magnificent addition to your collection!
Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks for looking!

            I was told this is a vintage child's natural straw hat with pale yellow grosgrain ribbon and pale yellow flowers that dates back to 1890.  How this hat could be more than 100 years old is beyond comprehension but it is really beautiful. The pale yellow ribbon surrounds the crown and ties in a flat bow in the back of the hat and the streamers continue down for about two feet.  The pale yellow flowers and green leaves surround the crown as well and the photos show what pristine condition the hat is in.  The hat is sitting on a regular mannequin head that can take a size 22 hat so it would fit a young adult as well as a child.

Shipping informations: this product may take several weeks to arrive in some countries, you must be aware of this problem that has nothing to do with me but with the weaknesses of international postal system. There is no default tracking included, tracking is available for countries listed below* - third thumbnail beside ""item details and stars"", called Shipping & Policies, this is an international shipping, not a domestic one. Shipping weight ± 320 gr - 11.5 ounces -
— Read Absolutely Before Buying —
THE MAIN PREREQUISITE IS TO READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING
1/ It Is For Laser Printer Only!
2/ There is an obvious need to know how to modify laser printer settings for using thin papers, if you don't know it Will Jam.
3/ This product is intended to be used by semi-professionals or people understanding that in DIY there is the meaning of Do It Yourself - Beginners, Go your way -
4/ This Paper Is Not Made For Newbies - It Is Not Intended For Persons Untrained -  << This Is Not A Game   
5/ The paper is thin, 45 gr/sqm make sure to load sheets one by one or it may jam. 
6/ Settings are available on your laser printer or ask your laser printer manufacturer 
7/ Do Not Buy A Laser Printer If You Do Not Have Already a Strong Experience In Transferring Images and Laser Printing Pictures. 
Warning #2, the results will depend on you skill, on the type of gel medium or glue used, the amount of gel medium spread and the drying time, please make tests before, there is a knack that only comes with experimentation, like on ALL Do it Yourself process.

Carpetism ""breaks the routine"" and creates a 'WOW' effect by the house guests. We make beautiful and very colorful handmade chainstitch embroided rugs which bring color and life into your home and pour optimism to your environment.
Our rugs are made of wool sheep from Australia which goes to the artisan village we work with. Based on the designs we create, the wool is then hand dye by various colors and let to dry in the sun. Then, using a special hook called ""Aari"", it is manually being handstitch, embroided and sewn. Once the design is all finish, a canvas (cotton) is being sewn to the backside of the rug to protect it and keep it in tact. 
The whole process is typically takes 8-10 weeks of making one rug (!!), and is what makes them so unique in design and quality.

7935,Oversized Wall Clock - Family Clock - Family Name Clock - Custom Family Clock - Handmade Wood Clock - Rustic Wall Clock - Large Wall Clock,"
            30” Oversized Wall Clock - Family Clock - Family Name Clock - Custom Family Clock - Handmade Wood Clock - Rustic Wall Clock - Large Wall Clock 
I've been building these clocks for my local market for a few years now. However, I'm receiving more and more enquiries from clients further afield and I've decided to share my custom designed clocks with you, the discerning Etsy shopper! 
This particular clock design has subtle gray undertones and is a beautiful match for ""greige"" or walls with gray undertones. If you're a ""wrongcolorphobe"" like me :o) you prefer hanging pieces on your walls that blend with the undertones of the wall it's being hung on and its surrounds. That's why this is the perfect match for walls with gray/neutral  undertones where you don't want yellow/red undertones. I carefully select boards from wood species that will allow for this type of color blending but still showcases the natural grain and well earned character of each board. 
Each custom Family Name clock design, is a collaboration between the client and myself. The clock in the photos has a ""R"" monogramed in the center and the family's last name is Rush. We decided to incorporate the last name into the quote! Customized creativity is what it's all about!  If you look at image 5 you will see an example of a design mock-up. If you decide to purchase one of my custom creations, we will collaborate on the design of your clock and you will receive a choice of mock-ups for your approval. 
As you will notice in the pictures, the clock has distinct knots, nail holes, and characteristics that are uniquely its own. Therefore, each clock will have its own special characteristics and no two clocks will be exactly alike. And that should be exactly why you're reading this description, you want authentic and you want unique! So ... you've come to the right place! 
The listing for this clock is for a 30” Custom Family Name clock that includes choices like:
	•	Monogram Initial and/or Full Family Name 
	•	Any additional text
	•	Roman Numerals or Numbers
	•	Color blends on clock face
You also have the option to include two trim finishes at an extra cost: 
	•	You can add the interior metal ring which adds extra depth and dimension to the center part of the clock.
	•	You can add the faux metal trim around the perimeter of the clock to add that extra
                special finishing touch.
****** See these options highlighted on image 3 and make your choice in the Clock Variations drop-down menu ******
If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me.

The current waiting period is about 3 weeks. You will be contacted once your sculpture is started. Then allow for about 3 additional days to create and ship your custom Niffler.

Each one is totally handmade from scratch so no two are exactly the same. The perfect keepsake for Potterheads and any fan of the Fantastic Beasts and Harry Potter series!

The Nifflers pictured in this listing are already sold and are examples only.

'Pose 1' shows many variations on the same pose). Otherwise you may choose 'No Preference' and I will randomly create you a design using my artistic license, OR if you have a specific request in mind that doesn't match any of the sculptures shown, please select 'Other' and leave a note when checking out or send me a message.
• YES you can customise your Niffler! Please tell me if you would like something special - eg. a scarf in your house colours, a different coloured Niffler, or a keychain, hanging ornament, necklace etc :)
• Your Niffler may be created with gold or silver coins, crystals, coloured glass stones, chains or beaded 'jewellery'. Unless otherwise specified, I will randomly select the accessories.
• Once I begin your sculpture, you cannot request a different pose. I will send you a photo before and after baking so you can see what your sculpture looks like before it ships.
❈--------------------------------------------------------------------------❈
""The Niffler is a British beast. Fluffy, black and long-snouted, this burrowing creature has a predilection for anything glittery. Nifflers are often kept by goblins to burrow deep into the earth for treasure. Though the Niffler is gentle and even affectionate, it can be destructive to belongings and should never be kept in a house. Nifflers live in lairs up to twenty feet below the surface and produce six to eight young in a litter.""

9255,Keepsake Bear - Memory Bear - Stuffed Bear made from an outfit of your choice including baby outfit,"
            PLEASE READ ALL OF THE FOLLOWING!!!
This listing is for a custom made keepsake bear that will be made out of a keepsake outfit(s) that you send to me.  After you purchase the listing, you will be messaged my address to send the outfit(s) to.
1.) Must have at least TWO outfits or allow me to use complementing fabric for extra fabric if needed if the outfit is size newborn or 0-3 months. If I am to use a complementing fabric, it will be a solid color to match and be 3 extra.
2.) If size 3-6 months and over, the feet of the bear will be the feet from your outfit...a cool little twist!
3.) Please allow at least 2-3 weeks after receiving your outfit to have the bear made.
4.) If ordering a bear, must mail outfit within 3 days.
5.) Note, the longer it takes me to get your fabric, the longer turn around you will have due to the fact that I will be making them as the outfits come in
This bear measures approximately 12 inches from top of ear to feet or 6 inches from head to rump (how tall it sits). The third picture shows a bear made from two outfits.
YES! I can make these out of Kickee Pants! :-) see last photo.
EMBROIDERY OPTIONS:
1.) Can only be 5 characters long at this point
2.) This can be placed on either the back, belly, or bottom at this time.
3.) Leave in the notes to seller area what you would like your embroidery to say and where you would like it placed
HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR OPTION:
3-6 months or higher: this is the size outfit you will be sending.  Choose this option if you are going to send an outfit that is 3-6 months or larger
0-3 months or lower-2: This is if you are sending TWO 0-3 month outfits or lower (THREE if premie)
0-3 months or lower-1: This is if you need me to use a complementing fabric as there is not enough fabric in a size 0-3 months or lower outfit but you only want to send me one.
Embroidery 3-6&up: This is to add the embroidery option for 3-6 months size and up (please remember to read the embroidery section)
Embroidery 0-3&down: This is to add the embroidery option for 0-3 month clothes and lower when only sending ONE outfit
Embroidery 0-3/2: This is to add the embroidery option for 0-3 month clothes but you are sending TWO or more outfits
ASK ME ABOUT OUR NEW EMBROIDERY OPTION!!!
NOTE: AS OF AUG. 7, 2016, THERE WILL BE NO REFUNDS FOR THIS ITEM IF THE BUYER FAILED TO SEND THEIR OUTFIT NEEDED TO MAKE THIS PRODUCT. I apologize that I have to write this note. Several individuals have ordered and do not send their outfits. They also fail to respond to any efforts made to contact them. Please be mindful that this is a business. I am willing to accommodate people as long as they communicate with me that they are having a problem with sending the outfit. What I am saying is please keep the lines of communication open and we can work through almost anything. Thank you for your understanding.
FAQ:
How long will it take you to make one?

10025,"D20 Spindown Life Counter Die for MTG, Stainless Steel - 'Center Arc' Metal Balanced Dice","
            This is a twenty sided die (D20) that is intended to be used as a life counter for games such as Magic: the Gathering. The numbers on the die are arranged in a 'spindown' pattern, which makes it easier to find the next number up or down. The die is perfectly balanced so that it gives fair results when rolled.
This die is 3D printed in stainless steel, and is available in several different finishes. (See the last picture for examples of these options.) Because of the 3D printing process the surface of the die is slightly grainy. 
Because it is printed in steel it has a nice solid feel and weight to it. (This die weighs approximately 15 grams, whereas a regular plastic one weighs only about 6 grams.) The die is about 30 mm (1.2"") high, when measured straight across between a each set of opposing faces. This is larger than a regular MTG spindown die, as you can see in the pictures. Picture 4 shows this die compared to my other design for a spindown d20, which is also available here on Etsy.
You will receive the die in its blank metal state. To give the die some more definition and make the numbers stand out more, you can easily darken or 'ink' the recessed parts. To do so take a small paintbrush and some thinned black acrylic paint (about one part water to one part black acrylic) and simply dab the thinned paint all over the die. Let it dry out (you can use a hairdryer to speed this up) and gently rub the painted die on a piece of cloth. This will remove the paint from the more exposed areas, and leave it behind in the folds and the background behind the numbers. If you missed a spot, or if you want a heavier effect just repeat these steps until you get it to look just the way you want.
Please be advised that, with the stainless steel material option, as a result of the production process, there can sometimes be some residual particles of polishing medium stuck in the details of the design. These bits of polishing medium (corn cob particles), which look like small grains of sand, can be easily removed using a pin, a toothpick or a small (wire) brush.        ",28.87,4.9524,"Handmade item

10188,Premium Fire Rope Dart,"
            Time to take your rope dart to the next level? The Fire Mecca Premium Rope Dart was designed with professionals in mind, and is perfect for anyone looking for a serious rope dart. 
We worked closely with several professional fire performers who specialized in rope dart to figure out exactly what they wanted from their tools. Arguably, the most important part of a rope dart is the rope, so that’s where we started. We tried numerous ropes, until we found the perfect blend of comfort, strength and durability in ¼” (6mm) braided hemp rope. At one end of the rope we have a hard rubber PX3 knob as a stopper, on the other a short length of stainless steel Twistlink chain with a swivel welded on each end to ensure the head never binds. 
With the body done, it was time to move on to the head. Most rope darts on the market utilize a large poi head, which works fine for most spinners, but our professionals wanted something more. The trick was creating something that meets Fire Mecca’s standards of aesthetics and durability while also meeting the needs of a serious rope dart user. The end result was an extra-large (5 inch) K1 1/4"" Moonblaze head, built on a solid steel core with washers braided in to the head to improve flight without sacrificing the appearance. The end result is a rope dart head that’s a little on the heavy side, but flies like a dream. 
Rope Darts have many siblings and go by other names: chain dart, single headed meteor hammer, etc.
If the length you need is not an option please place length, up to 16 feet, in your order notes. Handmade to order locally in Tucson, AZ, USA.        ",135.00,4.8421,"Handmade item

11253,"Claddagh Ring (Women) -  A traditional Irish ring which represents love, loyalty, and friendship in 925 sterling silver for women","
            The Claddagh ring is a traditional Irish ring which represents love, loyalty, and friendship through the clasped hands which represent friendship, the heart representing love, and the crown representing loyalty.
The Claddagh ring belongs to a group of European rings called ""fede rings"" dating from Roman times, when the gesture of clasped hands was a symbol of pledging vows, and they were used as engagement/ wedding rings in medieval and Renaissance Europe.
Fede rings are cast in the form of two clasped hands, symbolising faith, trust, or “plighted troth”  The Claddagh ring is a variation on the fede ring.  Towards the end of the 20th century there was an explosion of interest in the Claddagh Ring, both as jewellery and as an icon of Irishness.  In more recent years it has been embellished with interlace designs and combined with other Celtic and Irish symbols, but this is a very recent phenomenon that corresponds with the worldwide expansion in popularity of the Claddagh ring as an emblem of Irish identity
Made in solid sterling silver our Claddagh ring is made to order to your finger size.  We make both male and female rings.  Please see 
https://www.etsy.com/your/shops/LaGrangeBijoux/tools/listings/226521410
 for the mens ring.
Please add a note at checkout about the size you would like. We can use all international ring size scales. Please measure your ring size carefully.
Rings are delivered in a presentation box and all packaging is included in the shipping price. All items are sent using the French La Poste system by Priority Letter. If you require tracking and/or insurance please message us.

11683,"Love Letter to Biology 250 (Chella Courington) chapbook, micro fiction","
            Love Letter to Biology 250 is a chapbook of micro fictions by Chella Courington. This manuscript pinged our nerd-brains when we first read it, flirting with obscure tidbits from Biology lectures—those things we remember because they're strange—crafted into really tiny stories.
The cover is printed on Epson matte professional paper, each trimmed and bound by hand, finished with a hand-cut title flag typed (old school!) on kraft brown paper. The artwork, ""Jelly Flyby,"" is watercolorink on paper (9 x 12 inches) by Jonathan Rountree, one of our in-house artists.
Excerpt from ""Preferring a Clean Virgin:""
The male dark fishing spider climbs her Amazonian body, his legs under a third her size, her abdomen mountainous, fourteen times heavier than his, and he rocks her, side to side, his pedipalps engorged until the blood pushes too hard against arterial walls, curling him against her. Stuck to her, he’s consumed by her. The number and size of their offspring increased by his sacrifice.
About the Author
Chella Courington is Professor of Creative Writing at Santa Barbara City College. Her prose and poetry have appeared in numerous journals including The Los Angeles Review, lo-ball magazine, Gargoyle, The Tusculum Review, and Danse Macabre. In 2011 Courington published Paper Covers Rock, a flipbook of lined poetry, Indigo Press; Girls & Women, a chapbook of prose poetry, Burning River; and Talking Did Not Come Easily to Diana, an e-book of linked microfiction, Musa Publishing. Her work has been honored by Camroc Press Review, The Collagist, Qarrtsiluni, and Main Street Rag, and nominated for Best of the Net and Best New Poets Anthologies.
About the Cover Artist:
Jonathan Rountree (BFA Studio Art, Northern Kentucky University) is an aspiring world-traveler seeking to explore the intricacies of this realm armed with clay, camera, canvas, and paper.
About the Press:
Porkbelly Press creates chapbooks in handbound, small editions. Launched in 2014, PP seeks works with a strong sense of voice, place, and just a touch of fabulism, folklore, or magic. We make our home on the banks of the Ohio River, in a little town called Cincinnati, where pigs fly. // porkbellypress.wordpress.com

(This listing is for one copy of the chap.)
What others are saying about Love Letter:
    “This collection is a work of freshness that is always surprising and never disappointing. Courington manages to do fascinating things with common images and she gives those images new life in a pleasing and sometimes disturbing oblique sort of light. Her terse, intense, and honest stories are presented in an earthy narrative voice in language full of longing and desire. These stories are both playful and provocative and can leave a reader almost breathless at times. Combined, the stories make up witty but also quite serious and worthwhile explorations.” —Pamelyn Casto, editor of Flash Fiction Flash Newsletter
    ""Like a scientist in her laboratory, Chella Courington is careful and precise as she dissects the specimens before her. But Courington’s prose, like her eye, is enveloping, passionate yet also crystalline, hard and clean and clear, rewarding the discerning reader with these multifaceted gems."" —Robin Lippincott, author of In the Meantime        ",9.50,5.0,"Handmade item

13780,Standard 9 inch Birdcage Veil - Bandeau Style - Custom Colours Available,"
            Our popular standard birdcage veil is a modern classic.  Pair it with any of our fascinators or wear it alone for a classic vintage look.  
Our bandeau veils are made by hand from high quality Russian veiling in a perfect shade best described as natural ivory - it matches so many dress tones perfectly.  If your dress is stark white, we advise you go with a brighter tone.  Please ask us if you require white.  We 
only use the finished edges on our birdcage veils, both on the top and bottom, so you'll never see a hand-cut or jagged edge on our pieces.  This detail is what gives a birdcage veil its iconic look and so we never compromise it.
This veil attaches securely with thin, discrete satin-wrapped bobby pins, making it easy to work into any style and simple to remove post-ceremony if you like (without messing up your perfect locks).  
Please note:  Fascinator not included.
Ships free with any other item.
Unless otherwise requested, item ships in lightest ivory.
Love it, but want it in a different colour?  Just let us know which colour you need and we'll do our best to match it.  Please note that a small fee applies for this service.
Please note that the fascinator pictured in not included but may be purchased here:

            I love this carded sari silk, it's so soft and will add plenty of colour to your fibre projects. It comes in a continuous length of roving and can be spun directly or combined with other fibres to produce batts or rolags. If combined with wool it can be used for wet or needle felting too.
I like to add them to my carded art batts for splashes of colour and texture. The turquoise really pops and you'll find a little bit goes a long way.

            This listing is for all the glass rods you see in the pictures. The first three pictures are Filigrana glass rods which are beautifully vibrant colored glass encased in clear glass.

1 navy blue in clear
1 light blue in clear
1 red in clear
1 dark green in clear

There are also one gold adventurine rod, and 3 blue adventurine rods.

These rods are ready to ship. I ship by insured Regional Box A USPS priority mail. Because the longest rod is 13"" long, it takes a special size box to ship them to you.

15558,Pretty in Pink purple pastel stained glass kit stained glass chime kit pre cut pre drilled glass chimes sun catcher,"
            These 5 pieces of glass are pre drilled, pre cut and smoothed with my glass grinder so they won't cut your fingers with sharp edges.  They are all ready to thread with fishing line and used as a sun catcher and/or wind chimes.
Cutting, grinding and drilling holes in glass isn't as easy as it sounds.  I have made all the mistakes, I have cut my self to pieces, I have shattered a lot of glass. I got all that out of my system and I finally figured it out.  So let me do the dirty work for you.  I have the supplies, I have the knowledge, some days I even have the skills and I have the mess already started.  What's a little more broken glass lying around?
These are so pretty!  For some reason I have the hardest time finding pink glass that I like.  Well, this is some pink that I was very fond of along with a lovely pastel purple and some textured clear color changing glass.
I have tried to take some of the difficulty out of making something really unique and beautiful with glass.  
If you have any questions or requests please feel free to message me here on Etsy.  I will be happy to do custom orders or specific colors for you.
P.s. my shipping costs here are just estimates and this is how I work...If I under estimate I pay the difference.  If I OVER estimate I refund you.  There are just so many variables when it comes to this sort of thing!        ",12.00,4.9524,"Handmade Supply

20224,Kurama~ Kyuubi Tailed Beast from Naruto onesie/kigurumi/costume~,"
            Meet my  Handmade Kurama Nine Tails Beast from Naruto onesie for cosplay or everyday life ^^ Originally it was made for myself for one day AnimeNights convention in Lithuania.
This Handmade cozy Kyuubi onesie is made of warm fleece and has: a double hoodie with ears and face, front snap fastening, pockets and sewn nine tails in back.  It don't have a hool in back. Here you can see me, I'm 160cm tall. 
More photos of this kigu you can find in my page: https://www.facebook.com/KaeriART 
IMPORTANT:
 * Shoes are NOT included ^^ 
 * The arms and legs can be finished with elastic gum or orange (like in picture) or black colour cuffs or in one set with orange colour arms cuffs and black colour legs cuffs ^^~
Type: Onesie/Kigurumi
Genger: Unisex
Size: YOURS (so I will ask some of your measures)
WASHING YOUR KIGURUMI !
  * Turn your kigurumi inside out. This keeps the fabric from getting nappy.
  * Put it in the washing machine! Yep, our kigurumi are washing machine safe. 
  * Use any detergent you'd like. Using a fabric-softener is recommended and will hellp you to keep them soft.
  * Wash your kigurumi on ""Cold"" for its first cleaning. This helps the color set it. After the first wash feel free to use the ""Warm"" setting in case your kigurumi has got stubborn stains.
    You can use the ""Normal"" or ""Permanent Press"" cycle on your washing machine. If you're worried about your kigurumi, the ""Gentle"" cycle should also do the trick.
  * Never bleach your onesies. Using non-chlorine bleach is however safe. Chlorine bleach will damage the texture by destroying the fleece fibers. 
  * After the washing machine, you can either put your kigurumi in the dryer or hang it out to dry.
    If you hang it out to dry, be sure to keep it out of direct sunlight.
    If you use a dryer, we recommended using either the ""Air Dry"" or ""Fluff Air"" setting (with no hot air as it may cause shrinkage). 
 * To prevent wrinkles, take it out from the dryer and hang it as soon as it is done.
  * Never iron your fleece kigurumi. It will lay the pile texture flat hence the beauty will be destroyed. 
That's it!
WASHING: Machine Wash Cold, Non-Chlorine Bleach, Dry Flat, Do Not Iron, Do Not Dry Clean
