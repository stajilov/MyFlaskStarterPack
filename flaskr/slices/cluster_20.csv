HOW TO WEAR YOUR TIE BAR- RECOMMENDATIONS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Size of Tie Bar compared to tie width: 
A tie bar should never be wider than your tie; 3/4 the width of the tie is just about perfect.

A good rule of thumb is to fasten the tie bar between your third and fourth buttons, around the sternum, and just below the pectoral muscles.

TWO SIZES AVAILABLE *all pictures shown above are of a smaller sized pet teepee*
I made my first play tent for the very first birthday of my daughter. We had a pow wow themed party that everyone enjoyed very much. I also got a lot good words for the teepee tent - after the celebration I decided - why not make some more tents to be enjoyed by others too.
As we tested our ready made tipi with a lot of kids - we came to a conclusion, that a play tent can not stand stable on its own - it needs a supporting system, that all our teepees now have!
Then I decided to go further and make a teepee for my friend's dog. This is how my pet teepee era begins :)
This teepee has for walls and an entrance, decorated with pompom trim. Equipped with natural wood vertical and horizontal poles. Supportive system ensures that the pet teepee is standing still at all times.
I also has a soft double sided mat with a matching pompom finish.
This teepee is a smaller copy for a children teepee, can be matched together!

Succulent Care
Succulents are drought tolerant plants that are easy to care for and require very little. There are three points of care you want to keep in mind when caring for your succulents.
Water: The most important part of succulent care is when and how to water. Only water the plants when the soil is completely dry. If the soil has any moisture, do not water them at all. If it takes three weeks for the soil to dry out then water in three weeks, if it takes three days then water in three days. This is the most important part of proper succulent care. When you water your plants be sure they are being watered in the evening or late afternoon. Succulents best absorb water and nutrients from the soil during their rest period (which is in the evening). Also, water acts as a magnifier and will certainly help burn your plants in the hot months if they are watered in the morning or during the day. Succulents need excellent drainage. If a succulent is being potted in a container with no drainage it is important to know they should be watered sparingly. Anything more will kill the plant. Over-watering succulents is the easiest way to kill succulents. It is also important to address under-watering. An under-watered succulent will show signs of stress with drooping or withered leaves. The leaves can also start to develop brown spots. A good watering will perk the leaves right up. Be sure to never mist your succulents. Misting Succulents or Cacti will cause rot and/or fungal diseases. Succulents are not house plants or flowers. Misting succulents will kill the plant. Succulent plants need to be watered thoroughly when the soil is dry so that the water reaches the entire root system; then they need to dry out.
Sunlight: There is a very tricky line when you first receive your succulents in regards to how much sun the plants should receive. All Shop Succulents plants are greenhouse grown which means they need to acclimated to sun gradually once you receive them especially in the hot months. When you first receive them keep them in soft sun or indirect light only and slowly introduce them to direct sunlight. Not being careful with proper sun introduction can cause the plants to sunburn. Burn will either kill the leaves or cause them to look unsightly. Imagine yourself being in a dark room for a while and then stepping out into harsh, direct sunlight. This can hurt your eyes until your eyes adjust. The same holds true with succulents and cacti. Our plants are greenhouse grown (which means they have a proper grower's shade filter over them always allowing just the right amount of light and heat). They are then put in a dark box and shipped. Be cautious here especially in the hotter months of the year. Conversely, succulents and cacti need ample sunlight to look their best. This is where it can get tricky. It will probably take some testing on your part to figure out the optimum solution for your plants in regards to where you live. You will know your plants are not getting enough light when they start to grow and stretch out. This is called getting 'leggy'. A succulent does this when it is not receiving enough light and is stretching toward the light to receive more. Indirect light for the first few days is ideal. The next step is typically giving them direct morning light only. Morning light tends to be softer. This is a great way to ensure your plants are getting the light they need in a timely fashion but not over doing it. Continue in this manner to ensure your plants receive excellent light but do not burn.
Helpful Tip: The vibrant color of succulents is mostly maintained with proper light and water. Succulents can boast some beautiful and vibrant colors. Most succulents will get more vibrant with more sun but some will want diffused sun to offer their best color. Watch your plants and try different light to maintain the perfect look!
Temperature: Succulents are very tough plants but they are not indestructible. A good rule of thumb is to not allow your plants to be in temperatures below 40 degrees without protection. Succulents truly thrive between 50 degrees and 85 degrees. It is ok if the temperature gets above this mark, you will just need to take extra precaution to ensure your plants do not burn. You will want to keep your plants out of direct afternoon sun if the temperatures are rising above 85 degrees.

What do I do when my plants arrive?
Be sure to immediately bring your package inside and completely unwrap your plants. All Shop Succulents plants are packaged with shredded paper to keep them secure, dry, and warm in transit. Often it is easiest to open the box from the bottom and carefully remove the pots. This allows you to remove the crinkle paper from the plants without disturbing the plants. Gently blow off any loose soil from the leaves. Place your plants in a location that they will be able to receive soft sun or indirect light. Only water your plants if the soil is completely dry. Refer to the Succulent Care guide above.
What if soil is displaced or my plants fall out of their pots in transit?
We take every precaution to fully protect your plants in transit. From time to time a package will endure a little more stress in transit causing some soil or plants to come loose. Succulents are incredibly resilient plants, requiring little care, and not easily damaged. Should this happen simply collect the loose soil, put it back in the pot, moisten the soil and make a depression in the soil to replant the succulent. Place the succulent in the depression just created and gently push soil back to hold the plant in place.
How do I replant my succulents?
Potting up or re-planting succulents is incredibly easy. Succulents boast many species and grow in a variety of ways. Often times the plant is easy to remove from it's original pot, where essentially the entire plant and soil base are easily removed from the cup. These are pretty self explanatory to replant. It can be mentioned here, that if the container is fairly shallow and needs less then the entire soil base, you can simply grab the soil and break off up to half of the soil base and roots without putting the plant in shock. Some species (like sedums and crassulas) have a tendancy to come apart when removing them from their pot. These species tend to grow for coverage and offer that 'spilling' or 'trailing' effect. As they may not be spilling or trailing in the 2"" pot they will be once repotted and allowed a little space to grow. To manage these plants you will want to squeeze the sides of the pot to loosen the soil a bit. Put your hand over the whole top of the plant while turning the cup upside down. This will start to remove the plant from the container. Use your other hand to grab around the soil just under the plant itself. This will keep the plant and roots together for replanting. You will want to create the depression in the soil with your other hand while not taking your hand off the soil around the plant. You can then place the plant and soil in the space created and gently compress the soil around the plant to be sure it does not come apart. Finally, some succulents will have multiple plugs in each pot. These succulents often look like individual sticks. If the plant is easily removed by itself with little soil and or roots attached do not be alarmed. Many species have delicate or shallow root systems. It is ok to remove just the plant and plant it wherever you like. The plant (with proper care) will take root and continue to grow. Many succulents are grown from cuttings off of mother plants. This simply means a cutting is taken from the mother plant (given a day or two to dry) and replanted in soil. These plants start without roots but easily begin to take root and grow.
Helpful Tips:
-The chalky substance found on most succulent leaves is a protective substance that helps protect the plant from pests, disease, and sunburn. Do not intentionally rub off this film. It is best to handle the plant at it's base to avoid removing this chalky substance from it's leaves.        ",14.95,4.7839,"Handmade item

Great collector’s item – and fabulous desk accessory or conversation piece!
Hallmarked J.Chein & Co, Made in U.S.A.
Measures 4” tall x 4 ½” wide (including wind up key) x 2” deep
About J. Chein:
J. Chein & Company was an American toy manufacturer in business from 1903 through the 1980s. It is best remembered today for its mechanical toys made from stamped and lithographed tin produced from the 1930s through the 1950s.
Founded by Julius Chein in a loft in New York City, Chein's earliest toy production was a line of premiums for the Cracker Jacks snack line. The American Can Company provided the lithographic printing for Chein's early output until 1907 when Chein opened their own full production plant in Harrison, New Jersey. Walking, crawling or jumping figural wind-up toys became a mainstay; their coin banks were also consistently popular.
In 1926, Julius Chein was killed in a horse-riding accident in Central Park. Control of the company passed to Chein's widow who then turned the management of it over to her brother, Samuel Hoffman, who was already the founder and CEO of the rival Mohawk Toy Company. Under Hoffman's direction, J. Chein & Company expanded and prospered, producing many increasingly complicated mechanical toys.

I made my first play tent for the very first birthday of my daughter. We had a pow wow themed party that everyone enjoyed very much. I also got a lot good words for the teepee tent - after the celebration I decided - why not make some more kids teepees to be enjoyed by others too.
As we tested our ready made tipi with a lot of kids - we came to a conclusion, that a kids play tent can not stand stable on its own - it needs a supporting system, that all our teepees now have!
This beautiful kids teepee will be a perfect playing space for any kids room. Such private space is very welcomed by kids as they love to have their own corned to hide and play, read books or just relax.
Kids teepee has four sides made of unbleached natural canvas and outstanding front door, decorated with a pom pom trim, also a small transparent front door window.
Equipped with natural wood (asp) vertical and horizontal poles. Supportive system ensures that the kids teepee is standing still at all times. The poles are tied together with a matching rope and two big pompoms on top.

13145,Wedding Cake Mini Replica Custom Ornament - Replica Cake - Wedding Gift - First Anniversary - Newlyweds Gift - Clay Ornament Shop,"
            All ornaments are hand sculpted and in very rare instances, will I depend on a mold/texture sheet in order to complete certain aspects of the cake. All flowers are sculpted petal by petal as to achieve realism and reflect exactly how your cake is suppose to look. I pay very close attention to the small details, in which to replicate your cake. I don't believe in taking shortcuts.
COST :
This 30 listing is not a direct cost of replicating your ornament. This is only to be used as a deposit to secure your place in line. Purchasing without prior communication makes scheduling very hectic process for customers who I have had prior communication with and have made their deposit. Replications can start at 55 and up, depending on the complexity of your design.
HOW TO INQUIRE :
Please use the “Ask A Question” button on the right of this page, right under the listing title. Once you are in the message screen, towards the bottom of the box, you will see a button “Attach Image”. There you can add up to 3-4 images of the cake you would like me to replicate. 
Please allow me up to 48 hours to reply as I need to use my time for the creative process. I always try to use my downtime away from cake replicating to reply to emails.
AFTER COMMUNICATION :
Once I give you the approval to purchase the 30 deposit towards the cost of your replica ornament. When your deposit is completed, I will contact you to let you know where your place in line is at. 
If at anytime your order should need to be cancelled, I do charge a 20% restocking fee.
PROCESS : 
I will not actively communicate during the waiting period, but will send a message close to the quoted time frame once your base has been started with an expected completion time. Once the cake has been completed, I will send over a final photo for your approval. If you accept, a final payment will be created. I will not ship unless fully paid for. 
SHIPPING :
All cakes are sent Priority Mail with tracking and insurance. Cake will be wrapped in bubble wrap, set inside a white gift box, perfect for gift giving! And will be shipped in a bubble mailer for added protection.
SHIPPING COST : 
USA :
7.00 each cake
INTERNATIONAL & CANADA : 
35.00 each cake
(Shipping will be billed on final invoice)
ABOUT MY PROCESS :
I use polymer clay, acrylic paints and acrylic resin. All of the adornments (flowers, etc) are made out of a specific color blend for your flowers. Sometimes, I may use acrylic paint to bring out dimensions or details that I could not otherwise do with polymer clay. 
For cakes with toppers that are made of metal, resin silhouette shape or words. I have not had one I haven’t been able to duplicate yet. Silhouette and words toppers, I have a machine that will cut the shape out for me and the toppers are made of resin acrylic. In some instances it’s not always possible, and I will need to draw it by hand on clear acrylic. And will have the appearance of just the single letter or shape.
Toppers will always be shipped detached from the cake. During shipping it can get bounced around, which will cause the topper to break from the top of the cake, despite how much bubble wrap for protection I use.
Cakes are always lightly sealed to protect your cake from dust and dirt. If you should ever need to clean your ornament, please use a damp rag and do not use any other liquid besides water to clean your ornament.
Cakes will be shipped with a hook and white ribbon. Unless otherwise noted when ordering.
I can do wedding bouquets, baby's first birthday, bridal shower, bachelorette, over the hill and baby shower.
ABOUT ME :
I have been working with polymer clay for over 20 years now. A lot of my work has been featured in MTM magazine, Cheeserank.com (partnered with Ritz) and several online wedding blogs.

A good rule of thumb is to fasten the tie bar between your third and fourth buttons, around the sternum, and just below the pectoral muscles.

They are one of the few items that a man can purchase to show off his style! This listing is for a 2"" antique bronze tie clip w/ a complimenting rocket! Perfect for someone who loves space!

            This listing is for one personalized aluminum tie bar.

You can choose a tie clip for a skinny (2"" long) or a regular (2.5"" long) tie in drop down menu while placing your order.
We use pure 1100 Aluminum, which is food safe, does not tarnish and does not contain zinc or magnesium.

Hand stamping is a process where each letter is individually stamped into the metal. Each letter may not line up perfectly and some letters may be deeper than the others. This is not to be considered a defect and adds to the charm of each piece. This process is much deeper than engraving.        ",12.00,4.8187,"Handmade item

This is just  example of what I can create for you. I create and stamp in the metal by hand and not all the letters will line up perfectly like with mass produced items. I think It makes it unique. 
Just give me your idea for a custom made piece.  
I can write it with upper case, lower case or with both fonts. I can stamp also one from motives shown on last picture.

We offer two types of Crystal when encrusting this clutch. A Preciosa crystal and the original Swarovski ELEMENTS crystal. The difference between the two is the number of facets or cuts the crystal stones have which give it its sparkle. the more cuts to a stone the better its sparkle and the more it will reflect light creating a dazzling sparkly effect. The Preciosa stone has on average 12-14 cuts per stone where as the Swarovski ELEMENTS stones have 14 cuts per stone. We offer both types of crystals to suit our customers needs. They are both equally brilliant albeit one is more expensive than the other but they both provide high quality sparkle compared to other dull and cloudy stones on the market. We don't compromise on quality here.
*** As each Clutch is handmade to order, there will be slight variations from piece to piece. Although the exact elements shown in the listing photo will be used, crystal and stone placement will vary from pair to pair ***
*** We can usually accommodate a rush order if you contact us in advance ***
