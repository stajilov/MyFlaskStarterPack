1606,"Vintage Large Suitcase Style Oval Picnic Basket with Picnic Accessories for 4: Plastic Plates, Glasses and Metal Flatware","
            The basket is a nice, heavy duty woven wicker, with a sturdy loop wicker handle and brass latch/hardware.  The basket is in very good shape.   Not sure of the exact age of this kit, but guessing it is from the late 90's.   The interior is lined with cotton with a simple reddish stripe pattern.   This basket includes a set of four white plastic plates, 4 low-ball glass glasses and metal flatware with white plastic handles. This set is in great condition!  (Note - the color of the wicker is lighter than it looks in these pictures.  I think the sun and contrast is making it look darker).  
Perfect for a family picnic or camping trip!
 
Basket Dimensions:  
Height (not including handle):  12""
Width at widest point on sides:  15.5""
Thickness:  11.25""
Height including handle:  Approx 16.5""
Note:  This basket is heavy so shipping to east or west coast may be more expensive.  Midwest may be lower than the estimate.  Send me your zip code for an accurate estimate.  :)
Shipping Notes: I am committed to offering the lowest shipping costs to you. 
1. My shipping estimate is based on Parcel Post (takes about a week to arrive), and DOES include tracking. Shipping costs vary based on zip codes, so I am conservative in my estimate.  
2. If I have over-estimated the shipping, I send a same-day postage refund back through Paypal, rounded up to the nearest dollar. 
3. If you want extra services or quicker delivery, just let me know and I can give you an updated shipping estimate.
4. I will definitely combine shipping for multiple purchases and refund all excess shipping charges. 
5. I’m happy to ship outside the US. Just convo me for an estimate.        ",49.50,4.9477,"Vintage item

Simplicity is beauty. This is the nature unbleached muslin teepee.
Only two material was used for this teepee, 100% cotton and 100% solid wood. No fire retardant, no chemical treated fabric.
********************************
What is the different of Muslin teepee and canvas teepee?
Muslin is 4oz 100% cotton fabric and breathable.
Canvas is 10oz weight 100% cotton and durable.
Which teepee should I choose for my kids?
If you want to paint on the teepee, please choose the canvas version.
Other than this, I think muslin is enough for indoor use.
*********************************

10602,Guitar Strap - Personalized Leather Guitar Strap in the Smokey Pattern in Antique Black - for Acoustic or Electric Guitars,"
            When I started working with leather 12 years ago, one of the very first patterns I made I called the ""Smokey"" pattern. It included a hand-written, custom inscription.  I was the first one to do it, and the method I use, writing every inscription entirely by hand, gives my work a rustic, handmade, and very special look.  The inscription on this guitar strap can be anything you can imagine - song lyrics, wedding vows, a letter, or scripture.  What will yours say? 
To make this piece I start with a vegetable tanned tooling leather leather then cut, brand and dye it by hand before applying a protective coat to keep it safe from the elements. The antique black dye will vary from piece to piece because leather is a natural material so some may be darker or lighter than the image shown.
TO CUSTOMIZE THIS PIECE: Just add it to your cart and put the inscription as you would like it to appear on the strap in the ""NOTES TO SELLER"" section when you check out. No need for a custom listing! You can include up to 1100 characters including spaces and punctuation.
COLOR: This strap is ""antique black"" as shown in the picture. It's a black wash applied over the tan of the leather that allows some of it to show through, giving it a blackish brown look. Since leather is a natural material, some variation is to be expected.
STRAP OPTIONS: See the last photo for the two layouts. All straps are 2.5"" wide
Option 1 (top): Symmetrical strap, adjustable at both ends. Can be used with banjo, guitar, bass, or dobro. Adjusts from 45-58""
Option 2 (bottom): Tapered at one end. This strap works best for guitars. Adjusts from 38"" to 52"". 
PLEASE SPECIFY which option you'd like when ordering. All orders not specified will be made as Option 2. Both come with a leather tie to attach it to the head of the instrument if you don't have two strap pins. 
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE? I do my best to keep my current turn-around time listed in the main page of my shop. If you need something sooner, please send me a convo with the item(s), shipping location, and date needed and I will let you know if it is possible.

            Looking for the perfect gift for the musician in your life? The Smokey Guitar Strap is a handmade leather guitar strap with your choice of inscription.  Anything from rock and roll to scripture, wedding vows, love poems... whatever you want to tell that special someone, or remind yourself, while playing.
I start with a tooling leather leather then brand, paint, and dye it, and then apply a protective coat to keep it safe from the elements.  
TO CUSTOMIZE THIS PIECE:  Just add it to your cart and put the inscription as you would like it to appear on the strap in the ""NOTES TO SELLER"" section when you check out.  No need for  a custom listing!  You can include up to 1100 characters including spaces and punctuation.
COLOR: This strap is ""antique black"" as shown in the picture.  It is a black wash that is applied over the tan of the leather allowing some to show through.  The end result is a cool brown or warm black look.  It can vary from piece to piece since leather is a natural material and may be darker or lighter than the image shown.  If you would like something that is more of a true brown, please look in my shop for the ""Smokey Strap in Antique Brown"" instead since it is a more reliably light color. 
STRAP OPTIONS: See the last photo for the two layouts.  Both are 2.5"" Wide
Option 1 (top): Symmetrical strap, adjustable at both ends. Can be used with banjo, guitar, bass, or dobro. Adjusts from 45-58""

12913,ode to Peggy Carter blue and black stripe jacket 1940s style jacket UK seller,"
            urgh, i love Agent Carter's clothes, so i decided to make this jacket as an homage to Peggy. its a mix of 2 of her jackets from series 1. 
apologies, its really difficult to photograph stripes isn't it? 
so this material is quite a grey blue with a black satin ribbon style stripe. the directional use of the stripes really adds to the detailing. fully lined with black satin, interlined in drill to give the jacket some body. the back and the front are darted to give that fitted look (its a bit snug on the mannequin here, it'll look smoother on you) 
This is brand new made by me item, not a revamped jacket
can be made in any fabric, message me for a custom order or a quote
