6669,Floor Lamp Tripod Slim - Walnut,"
            Please Note: This lamp is made to order. Please allow 10 to 14 days before shipping. Shades are sold separately.
Brighten up your home or office with the new tripod Slim floor lamp! The Slim provides an alternative design to my original tripod lamp line, by providing a more slender appeal for those smaller spaces. The Slim features a unique three-sided tapered leg giving it a clean and graceful look from any angle. The hand shaped triangular center allows the legs to be attached with brass furniture fittings making them easily removable. The Slim is pictured with a neutral colored linen drum shade which adds to the overall modern look and feel (Please note: shade is not included). 
Pictured lamp has been handcrafted using solid Walnut. 
Walnut is a domestic hardwood growing in Mid and Eastern United States and up into parts of Canada. Walnut provides a naturally dark color wood that is often used in fine furniture and flooring. Color patterns can vary from light to dark brown or chocolate brown (heartwood) to a lighter white (sapwood). Traditionally the heartwood is used and the sapwood is either dyed or stained to match, however proper use of some sapwood can create unique and beautiful pieces of furniture. 
Please note photos represent previous built lamps. Wood color will naturally vary from light brown to darker brown with each lamp. 
Finish: Hand-rubbed Danish oil 
Lamp dimensions are measured from center of floor to top of shade harp. Dimensions are approximate: 
Floor Lamp: ~63” H
Base (leg splay): ~13 to 14 inches 
Lighting: 3-way switch (50, 100, 150 watt) (U.L. listed)
Lamp Hardware: Brass socket, brass harp and brass leg bolts
Hidden / Recessed Cord Lamps: Clear vinyl , 120"" total length, 60"" extends from lamp leg
Drop Cord Lamps: Twisted brown cloth cord with antique reproduction plug (U.L. listed)
Shade: Shade not included
Set-up: This lamp requires a very easy set-up (3 hex bolts). All hardware and hex wrench is provided along with rubber floor pads to use when lamp is set-up on hard surfaces. 
Hidden / Recessed cord lamps will ship with the corded leg already attached to the triangle. 
Please Note: Shade is not included. For reference, the shade measurements are 19.5'' diameter at the bottom, 15.5"" at the top and is approx. 12.5'' tall. Please send us a convo and we will be happy to send you links on places to purchase shade.
Some photos seen may represent previously built lamps. Grain patterns naturally vary from lamp to lamp. If you would like additional photos, please send convo. 
No wood dyes or stains are used in making Natural Grain Woodworks furniture pieces. All colors and wood grain patterns are 100% natural and are protected with a multiple step hand rubbed Danish oil finish giving each piece a smooth satin finish. Some woods will naturally darken with age. All furniture pieces are handcrafted in Wilmington, NC from carefully selected kiln-dried hardwoods and are built to be heirloom treasures for you and your family. Custom orders (including size and woods) on similar style pieces can be made. Pricing will vary and may not reflect prices of similar items listed. Please convo for more details.

            Let this little fire demon light up your world! 
Calcifer is a Fire Demon in a magical contract with Wizard Howl. He was originally a falling star, whom Howl was able to catch before he fell to earth and extinguished. He is a very powerful creature himself, with a great deal of magical ability, though cannot move beyond the confines of the hearth in which Howl keeps him without the wizard's help. 
This little porcelain oil burner is hand painted by me with Calcifer illustration in long lasting, quality enamel paint. Comes with a tea light and packaged beautifully and securely - Suitable for oils, incense salts and wax melts.
Please allow for subtle differences in each hand made item and allow 2 weeks for your item to be ready for dispatch!

15300,Custom Personalized Metal Clothing Tags 100pcs Made to Measure,"
            Custom Made to Order Fine Pewter Metal Clothing Tags
A custom tag is a great way to identify your work and reinforce your brands identity and professionalism. It can be attached to various pieces of clothing and acts as an artist's signature. 
Our offer is that of placing your logo and/or text inside any shape of your liking and casting your tags in fine lead-free pewter.
We often do custom shapes and finishes, so please contact us for any design inquiries and it will be our pleasure to give you a custom quote.
-------PROCEDURE-------- 
Simply send us a logo* and/or the text and font wanted on the tag. We will then send you a 3-D proof and go back and forth until the proof is approved. Once approved we will create a custom listing and we will print, mold, and cast the tags for you. 
The logo can be sent via e-mail or via a file sending service such as dropbox to:  info [!at] accessoiresmagiques.com
If a simple phrase and font are desired within a simple shape as seen in the photos one can simply communicate via etsy and let us know exactly what you want written and in which font. We will contact you in the case where we do not have a specific font.
Once we receive the logo and instructions it should take 1-3 business days to create a 3-D rendering as seen in the photo above in order to confirm the design. Once the design is confirmed the items should ship within 15 - 20 business days.
-------PRICING------
Our pricing is divided in two parts. The first part is a one time artwork/set-up fee of 100.00 which covers the time and materials needed to take your piece from a virtual proof to a physical piece and also covers the creation of a production mold. This fee also includes the storage of said mold for up to two years from your last order, meaning you can re-order at will and will only pay the per-piece price.
Afterwards we charge a price per piece, which varies based on the size, finish, and quantity desired. Every piece we make is unique so don't hesitate to send us a private message with the details of your project and it would be our pleasure to quote you.
Stock finish is antique or shiny nickel and one of the 4 rough dimensions seen in the photos; for any other finishing or design options please contact us and we will provide you with a custom quote. Additional fees may apply for more expensive finishes or more complex designs, but otherwise our prices for custom work are very reasonable; so don't hesitate to talk to us if you have a special idea. We have been casting for a very long time and can usually catch design flaws before items get molded for casting. 
!!-If the tag has already been set-up for casting any future orders will have the set-up fees waved and the customer will only pay the per piece price. -!!
Stock quantity is 100 pieces. For any larger quantities again please don't hesitate to contact us. 
------MORE INFO-------
Shipping includes tracking, which can be waved in the interest of reducing shipping costs, but the buyer assumes the risks. 
*Logos should be sent in a vector format; if you do not have your logo available in a vector format we can trace it for you, but additional artwork charges may apply.        ",111.81,4.9149,"Handmade Supply

17321,Hammered Earband Sterling Silver | Eco friendly Jewellery | Unusual Jewellery | Ear Climber |  Hammered Earrings | Ear Crawler |,"
            Hammered eco friendly sterling silver ear band
This is the hammered ear band that is worn like a normal stud earring but follows the ear up with a gentle curve to give a unique look. They're made from eco friendly recycled sterling silver so are perfect for those who are eco-conscious and prefer a sustainable, environmentally aware lifestyle. 
You have the option of left ear, right ear or both. There is the choice of left or right because I bend the earring slightly so that it curves up the ear and grips the ear. Depending onyx ear shape, the earring may slip from time to time but usually this isn't a problem.
The earring(s) comes with a sterling silver butterfly earring back and is hammered and then polished so it catches the light beautifully it is approximately 17mm long.
All Wild Fawn Jewellery is handmade using eco friendly methods. These include using recycled sterling silver and chemical-free alternatives in the manufacturing process. They will be delivered wrapped in white acid-free tissue paper.

17636,Helix Hoops | Very Small Cartilage Hoops | Small Sterling Silver Hoops | Very Small Silver Hoops | Tiny Silver Hoops | Tiny Silver Rings |,"
            VERY TINY Sterling Silver Cartilage Hoops. Set of 2. Helix Hoops, Upper Ear Hoops, Tragus Hoops.
Sterling silver hoop set of 2 hand formed, filed and tumbled for shine from eco friendly recycled sterling silver. Their size means that they give a very delicate look to the upper ear as opposed to the chunkier look that larger hoops can give. 
These hoops can also be worn on any other cartilage piercing!
-Product Information- 
You can choose between an inner diameter of 6mm (as seen in photos) or 7mm (PLEASE CHECK THEY WILL BE BIG ENOUGH for your piercing before purchasing as they are non refundable due to hygiene reasons). The wire is 0.8mm (20 gauge) which is standard for cartilage piercings.
I will send the hoops open like you can see in the second photo gift wrapped. Note that because of the small size, they will be fiddly to close but it can be done. To help (if you need it), pliers/tweezers are handy just to guide the ends together. Once closed, you can move the join area to the back so you can't see it

To ensure rhodium plated jewelry lasts as long as possible, keep it clean with a mixture of mild liquid shampoo and a little water. Never use any chemical cleaners on rhodium plated items, or ultrasonic cleaners that utilize chemicals. Do not use polishing cloths intended for use on gold or silver jewellery, and ensure pieces are not in regular contact with hard surfaces. Non-abrasive, lint free, streak free, micro-fibre cloths are ideal. Let all makeup and perfume dry before putting on jewellery. Wash any make up off jewelry with water and store in a protective box to avoid damage and wear when not worn.

How to measure?
Stand wearing socks on a piece of paper, marking the shape of your foot accurately with a pencil. Then with a ruler mark the line between the longest toe and the heel. The length of this line is the length of your feet. For a good fit the size of the shoe you chose should be at least 0.5 cm/0.2"" longer than your foot measurements. The width measurements provided are for the girth of the foot, just beneath the toes.
