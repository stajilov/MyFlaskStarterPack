            Sweet lavender collectible bear.  In the spring of 1984, Muffy VanderBear came to life as the fifth and littlest (7"" tall) member of the VanderBear Family.  This Muffy, named ""Clawed Monet,"" is from the Gibearny Collection (celebrating the romantic lavender-hues in Monet's Water Lily paintings of the French gardens at Gibearny), which was introduced in the Spring of 1990 and retired in 1994.  
Muffy is wearing a lovely dress in a floral print on soft gray, a lavender painter's smock and lavender vinyl shoes.  She has a  white flower and bow on her head, carries a painter's palette and has a tube of paint in her pocket.
Made by the North American Bear Company, Muffy is fully-jointed with a hand-stitched nose and rich golden plush.  The VanderBears are classic collectors' bears. In addition to baby Muffy, the VanderBear family includes father Cornelius (20"" tall), mother Alice (18"" tall), brother Fuzzy (12"" tall), and sister Fluffy (12"" tall).
No box.  Mint condition with original hang tags; factory dressed.  Designed by Barbara Isenberg.  Costume by Odl Bauer.  Ships via USPS Priority Mail Medium Box.

Please look closely at the pictures and ASK if you have any questions.

7351,"fleece dog mat, dog crate mat, pet bed, custom order, high sides pet bed, made to order","
            This listing is for a CUSTOM ORDER fleece pet bed -  NOT A READY TO SHIP ITEM.  I made the pictured pet beds as a special request for a customer, and I decided to make a listing for custom pet beds.  The pictured beds were made for a dog, but I can also make the beds for cats using cat print fleece.  
The bed is made with soft fleece; printed fleece on the top and solid color fleece on the bottom.  In between the two fleece layers is a layer of 1/2 inch thick quilt batting.  The bed is sewn all around the edges and then three inches from the sides.  The sides of the mat are stuffed with polyester fiberfill and are higher than the center of the bed.  The sides are stuffed very tightly and will keep their shape.  
As the bed is a custom, it will be made to order, and you can choose your fabric.  If you give me an idea of the type of print or color you would like, I will send you pictures of sample fabrics.  Once all the details are worked out, I will send you a custom order listing.  Once the order is paid for, I will order the fabric and start on your order when the fabric comes in.  Completion time is approximately 3 weeks.
Two sizes are pictured:
small:  approximately 23 long (vertical) x 14 wide (horizontal)
(Picture 4) Compared to large size in picture 5.
large:  approximately 24 wide (horizontal) x 30 long (vertical)
(Pictures 1 - 3) Compared to small size in picture 5.
The bed is washable on cold water, gentle cycle, no fabric softener and tumble dry low heat.  
Any questions, please let me know.  I would be happy to work with you to make the perfect mat for your pet.
Thanks for visiting, and have a nice day.

            Featured on Apartment Therapy, February 2016!
Fine art photograph of a classic, blue rowboat tied up in Bristol Harbor in Bristol, Rhode Island. 
TITLE: Room for Two
 
* This limited edition photo will be printed with archival pigmented inks, on your choice of either fine art, Hahnemuhle Photo Rag Ultra Smooth paper, or Kodak Endura Lustre paper. 
Hahnemuhle Photo Rag Ultra Smooth is an archival, heavyweight museum-quality paper with a completely matte, smooth finish. This is a premium fine art paper which provides the ultimate longevity and quality of print. The matte surface of this paper eliminates the possibility of glare under direct lighting.
Kodak Endura Lustre paper is a semi-matte, professional photo paper which provides excellent saturation and tones. The availability of this paper makes it a more economical option, and also allows for larger print sizes. Lustre paper is a hybrid between glossy and matte, giving the saturation and richness of a glossy paper, without the shine.
* The print will be hand-signed and dated in the lower corner or back of the piece, with the edition number hand-written in the opposite corner. The print run for this piece is 50 copies.
* All prints will be packaged in acid-free, moisture resistant sleeves, and shipped in stiff cardboard mailers, to ensure they arrive in perfect condition.
* Order this photo as a matted, framed print here:

After your perfect day, use this cake cutter in your kitchen every day for cutting cheese, fruit or spreading jam on toast.
Your initials or custom phrase (I wrote ""best day ever"" in cursive on this one) will be lovingly hand-burned into the side of this tool. 
This utensil, designed in collaboration with Elzner Originals, is made from Canadian cherry wood in Ontario and is exclusive to Lace and Twig...this beautiful knife makes a very durable kitchen tool. Further, wood has antibacterial properties making this a safe and eco choice for your wedding and home. 
This knife has been rubbed in olive oil and does not require special maintenance, apart from using soap and water to wash and re-oiling every once in while. Use this on ceramic, teflon, etc...it will not harm your beautiful pots, pans or silver stand.
Please do not put this in the dishwasher...wood dries out and it loses its smooth ""skin."" Use camping rules...a little bit of soap and water and it will be ready for the next cake :)
This listing is for one cake knife with customized initials and/or phrase.
Dimensions: knife: 17"" x 2.5""...handle is 11"" long!
Pair this with wedding forks...

            This cake plate is about 3 inches tall and comes in 16, 18 and 20 inches in diameter to accommodate larger cakes. The legs are natural reclaimed branches , which may vary from the photo, and the plate is made of pine that has been stained and lacquered. Other colors are available, just ask. 
Because we use natural wood products, your cake plate may not look exactly like the one pictured, but it will be just as beautiful. 
We highly recommend using a cake board or cake plate under the cake and do not recommend putting any food right on the wood, as staining may occur.        ",37.00,4.9154,"Handmade item

12871,Cake Server Wedding Cake Server Cottage Chic,"
            Cake Server Wedding Cake Server Cottage Chic Thank you Southern Wedding magazine for featuring our ""i do"" ""me too"" cake forks and cake server!!!. I have stamped a lovely vintage cake server with ""forever and for always"" on the top part of the server face. Then their names and wedding date on the bottom. I can stamp the server with whatever you would like as long as it will fit. The forks have been stamped with ""i do"" and ""me too"" with the wedding date on each handle, if you would prefer ""mr."" and ""mrs."" or ""bride"" and ""groom"" forks just let me know in the ""message to seller"" when you check out. If you are a same sex couple please let me know if you need two of the same fork. None of the flatware patterns are the same making it really unique and ""cottage chic"" looking. The set I create for you will also be mismatched and similar but not necessarily the exact same patterns used here. I try to pick patterns that ""play"" well together to create something really unique. I prefer the look of contrasting patterns as opposed to all of them being the same. It helps to really add to that ""cottage chic"" look.
If you are looking for a set that includes a full size wedding cake knife please see this listing:

Please take a moment to read my shop policies and check the shop announcement for current production times. If you are a UK resident please be aware that you will be responsible for any customs fees. This is not something that is or can be included in shipping costs here.
Please be sure to list all info needed, date and first names, in the ""message to seller"" when you check out. Please list the date in numerical fashion do not spell it out. this is important since the order of the mm/dd/yy differs depending on what country you reside in.
Please be aware that these are vintage hand stamped items and will not appear to be new or perfect. This is what gives each item it's unique ooak charm. Although I do my very best to find the best vintage silverplate available it will still show signs of having a previous life.
All items will arrive to your door ready for gift giving wrapped in crisp white tissue paper, tied with a hot pink bow and BPD round hang tag.
If you would like me to add a complimentary vintage  knife please let me know in the ""note to seller"". See pic at right.

            This listing is for 10 yards of solid gold sari silk ribbon. The perfect length for a smaller project like a wrap bracelet, gift wrap ribbon, hair bows, and more! Each 10-yard bundle is carefully measured and wrapped around a paper core to prevent tangling. This ribbon yarn is very soft and light! This is the softest, most pliable sari silk ribbon I have felt! The width of the ribbon varies from 1/2-inch to 1 1/2 inches. 
When silk fabric is cut and made into saris, wraps, and veils, there is always a bit left over. Rather than throw that waste fiber into the trash, it has been made into a beautiful, unique, soft yarn! Direct from India, this yarn is a truly recycled product! It is a bulky weight and is soft and easy to knit, weave, or crochet. 
This yarn makes wonderful hats, scarves, bags, trim, fringe, wraps, jewelry and more!
To view my full selection of sari silk ribbon, including multicolors and prints, visit my shop section ""Sari Silk Ribbon"" or click this link:

Testimony from Sarah B.: ""I must confess I was a bit skeptical if this tutorial would do anything for me and had to sleep on it...but I must say it's absolutely brilliant. Thank you for sharing your knowledge! I LOVE IT!""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Comprehensive instructions for advanced beginner to intermediate lampworkers to create my signature Transition Focal Bead that will teach you how to seamlessly blend 2 OR 3 colors.
It is assumed that you have the skills needed for basic lampworking and have an understanding of safety equipment, supplies, tools and heat control. This tutorial is NOT for the just beginning bead maker.
Step by Step instructions are accompanied by color photos. The beads illustrated are made with soft glass (104 Coe) and has not been tested with any other COE.

Kiln
3/32 Mandrel (coated with bead release) 
1 rod of clear glass*
1 or 2 colored rods of transparent glass in gradient shades*
Graphite Marver
Hand pulled or Commercial Stringer for embellishment (optional)
Patience, patience, patience
*The first half of this tutorial will teach you how to blend two colors. The bead illustrated uses basic clear and grass green transparents. The second half of this tutorial will teach you how to blend three colors. The bead illustrated uses medium amethyst, light teal and basic clear transparents. Both illustrations use Effetre 104 glass.

How its made by me. Step by Step Process
 
All of my products are made by me and only me.
1. Each of these unique items are first designed in CAD ( computer design) by me. 
2.After I have done the 3D design on my computer we will print the design in wax. 
3.After the design has been printed in wax I will then cast it into the metal of your choice which can be white, yellow or rose gold. 14k or 18k which ever you would prefer. 
4.After the casting has been done I will polish the ring to clean up any excess gold and mold it into the perfect ring. 
5.The next day I will start drilling into the metal so I can start setting the diamonds into the ring. 6.Once the diamonds have been set into the ring, I will then start to polish it up and then add the center stone if needed. 
7.Once all the diamonds have been set I will re-polish the ring again to perfect it. Once all these steps have been accomplished I will dip it in German Rhodium and hand it or ship it over to you.

20750,Chinese Rice Paper Umbrella,"
            This is a colorful and cheerful hand painted Chinese oil paper umbrella. It is in good condition, but does have some some issues. Three wood supports have come loose from the string that holds them in place, which can easily be fixed. There are a few small pokes in the rice paper due to these being loose. It is in good working condition and pops up and folds down easily. Umbrellas like these can add color to a room on top of wardrobes or tall chests of drawers. This one is especially pretty with it's hand painted flowers.
Oil paper umbrellas originated in China, but have been a part of many Asian cultures since. They had many uses and significances over the years.  In wedding ceremonies the Matron of Honor would shield the bride upon arrival to ward of evil spirits and given as a wedding gift would signify blessing to the woman to have a son. It was also used in traditional Japanese dances and tea ceremonies and as gifts to coming of age16 year old boys . 
This umbrella measures nearly 22 inches long and when open is about 33 inches wide.
