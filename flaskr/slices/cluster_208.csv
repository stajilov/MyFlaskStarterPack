6184,"Dog hat crocheted, Variegated Dark Teal and Winter White, Medium, Small or Xsmall","
            Dog hat crocheted, Variegated Dark Teal and Winter White,Medium, Small or Xsmall
One of our most popular hats! Hand crocheted dog ear flap hat with braids and pom-pom.   Yarn is a blend of lambs wool and mohair, white and variegated teal. Teal variegated color changes shades as it is crocheted as you can see in the picture, this is completely random depending on what part of the yarn is started with.  This results in a beautiful and unique hat every time.  
In addition to the ear flaps and braids, I also add an under chin tie so the hat stays securely on pups head!
YES, YES, AND YES!  You can convo me to order this hat in any other colors you want!!!
MEASUREMENTS: 
Measure your dog as instructed, see two pictures for examples. Put measurements in message box on check out. 
XSMALL:  About 8-10 inches around brim. These are VERY tiny and would be for a very small Chihuahua, Yorkie, etc. under 5 lbs. 
SMALL: About 11-12 inches around brim.. This would be for a Chihuahua or other small dog that is about 6-10 pounds.
MEDIUM: About  13-15 inches around brim.  This would be for  a dog that would be about 11-15 lbs.
IF YOU NEED ANY SIZES LARGER THAN THIS, CONVO ME FOR A CUSTOM ORDER.
MEASURE AROUND dogs head with tape measure placed just above the eyes, going around the head (like going around a globe in the middle), pick up ears and go under if dog has floppy ears.  
Hat will be made at time of order,  PLEASE be aware and allow the appropriate time for making and delivery.

            We just took a trip to the mountains, and the beauty of the mountains is spectacular! And I just love this saying for a baby or a little girl. So, voila! There is texture in every inch of this illustration, as I used newspapers, watercolors, vintage medical paper and much more. Thanks for looking! I also have this print for a boy: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/227909121/let-him-sleep-for-when-he-wakes-he-will?ref=shop_home_active_1
You can choose the size in the ""select a size"" drop down box. 
What will I receive in the mail? 
- You are receiving a print of the original creation - printed on a high quality Epson Matte paper using archival ink.
- There will be a small white border for framing purposes and it will be signed by me on the back. 
- 5 by 7 and 8 by 10 art will be enclosed in clear cellophane, and packaged in a sturdy mailer with chip board backing. 
- 11 by 14 art will be rolled up in a mailing tube. 
- 16 by 20 art is printed by an outsourced commercial printer and will be drop-shipped to you directly. The paper is an archival matte photo paper using archival inks (will last 100 years). The print will come shipped in a large flat box, and will be very protected by layers of clear sheets, bubble wrap and a sturdy insert. 
- There are no logos or watermarks on the art.
What is Lily Cole's creation process for the original art?
All of the designs are originally hand-drawn in a sketchbook. Then I might paint or adhere shreds of colorful paper. I then add in a lot of color, patterns, and textures digitally. You’ll find that typically the design involves lots of color and dimension. I've had so many customers say that it looks much better in person vs. on the computer screen. ;-) Note: if you like the design, but would like some colors to be changed, I can do that! Just message me. ;-)
If you are interested in purchasing this design as a jpeg (digital) for you to print yourself, please purchase this listing here:
