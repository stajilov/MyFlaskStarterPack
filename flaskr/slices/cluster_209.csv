            Elegant, 1950s Revlon Futurama lipstick case. This lipstick case comes with the original box.
The case was designed exclusively for Revlon by Van Cleef and Arpels. The Revlon Futurama ""click-in"" refill was put into the case. 
The silver plated tube has quite a bit of tarnishing (as shown in pictures); which provides a nice contrast in my opinion although not all may feel the same. The silver plating is also starting to flake in some areas.
The top of the tube has a coil of faux pearls and a rhinestone flower. The bottom of the tube is stamped ""Revlon 579"".
Measurements are approx.: 3"" tall and 1/2"" diameter        ",20.00,4.9,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            Rocket and Moon themed Marble Maze. 
Custom made by hand, this is a blue, fleece, marble maze. The Space Rocket and Moon have been cut by hand from felt and individually stitched onto the soft fleece. There is a marble securely sewn into the marble maze and is sandwiched between the two layers of fleece fabric. The aim of the game is to push the enclosed marble from the Space Rocket, through the maze to the Moon. 
It is approximately 17cm by 17cm and can easily be rolled up or folded for easy storage in a bag or pocket.
This Marble Maze toy is perfect for sensory and motor development. It can be useful for anyone who is on the Autistic Spectrum, or has ADHD and even Dementia.  It is also a great quiet toy for long journeys, weddings and waiting rooms as it keeps fidgety fingers and minds busy.
My three children and nephews love these mazes and are aged from 3 years to 7. The youngest did struggle at first with the concept of pushing the marble along the maze route, however they enjoyed the problem solving aspect and refused help from the others. Although the older children solved the maze faster they still relished the challenge and it kept them occupied for some time. (One of the older boys now takes it to bed with him as a softie...I didn't tell you though!)
I do my best to complete orders as quickly as possible. I have provided my absolute longest time it will take to dispatch your order, usually it will be sooner.
This Marble Maze is machine washable, please do not wash higher than 40 degrees and allow to air dry. 
If you would like to suggest a different theme then please contact me by message through Etsy. I will do my best to accommodate your wishes and shall respond as quickly as I can.
Please inspect the maze regularly for any loose threads or fraying that may occur over the course of time. The marble inside could cause a choking hazard if it were to be released from the maze. Please discard at the first signs of wear to remove any possible dangers.

11056,Oculus Rift Stand,"
            - Includes storage for Oculus Touch controllers
3D Printed CV1 Oculus Rift Stand
This stand includes storage for the Touch Controllers and Oculus controller as well as other things such as the microfiber cloth.  Along with this, the base includes a location to put the Xbox One controller and convenient canals in the base which allow you to adjust the weight of the stand using rolls of pennies.
The design implements a winged design that both securely holds the Oculus and protects the lenses by creating a barrier with the foam that prevents dust from getting onto the lenses.  The wings also have a opening in them that prevents proximity sensor activation while they are sitting on the stand.  
The stand is easily assembled with only 5 parts.  The stand can be used as is, without any hardware.  You may also glue the five parts together using a hot-glue gun if you want even more stability.  It is recommended to glue the touch controller storage as they are meant to be detachable, but any people want them to be attached securely.  
Customization is possible for 15 that includes lettering or symbols being put onto the stand.  Your choices are limitless, and customization is priceless.
3D Printing is the new fad, and people will be adept to ask how they can get something as cool as your stand.

            BLANK JOURNAL
These blank journals were made by a long-term customer of ours who passed away a few years ago. He made books as a hobby, and never tried to sell them! Anyway, his family came to us with several boxes of these handmade books.
These have sewn bindings with a headband--this is exactly how quality hardcover books are made; these journals will take a lot of use and abuse! Nice thick quality paper, very bright white.
Be creative, and do anything you want with these: dream journal, writer's notebook, diary, prayer book, or even a small sketchbook.
Available in five colors: red, burgundy, white, dark blue, black, and green. There is a limited amount of some of the colors, so they are subject to availability. As of January 13th, 2017, we're down to 1 black and 1 blue, but I did find a six more greens, so I've added them to the options.

HANDCRAFTED BY A MASTER
The Master is a skilled leather craftsman with many years of experience and will cut, shape, edge, brand, customize and assemble each strap by hand using only the finest materials sourced within the U.S., thus providing the highest degree of quality you can imagine – that’s Master Quality. Every order ships with a tin of the Master’s own in-house Master Leather Cream, an all-natural leather conditioner meant to keep your goods strong, long lasting…and wanting more.
STRAP THICKNESS:
Medium - This style is 1/8 inch thick and wears very comfortably with a supple nature. Great for every day use.
Thick - This style is 1/4 inch thick and is intended for the more hardcore user.
HARDWARE:
All hardware used is Stainless Steel including the solid drilled rivets. This Collar features one Stainless Steel O-Ring and a Stainless Steel Buckle.
Stainless steel hardware is the highest quality option for adult goods and this fact should not be taken lightly. It is best to avoid any other type of hardware due to its cheap and impure nature.
SIZE:
Every collar is cut to fit your specific size and will include several settings for a tighter or looser fit. The leather is approximately 1 inch wide and the thickness is optional at 1/8 inch and ¼ inch.
MEASURING:
It is very important to get an accurate measurement before placing your order. Every item in the shop is completely handmade and customized per order just for you. The be best way to measure for size is to use a flexible seamstress measuring tape that will easily wrap around the part of your body where you wish to fit the item. This style of measuring tape may be purchased in any local sewing shop or online for only a few dollars. It is well worth the investment to measure correctly as you build you custom restraint systems with Masterbind. If you are not able to secure a tape measure, then another method is to use a length of string to wrap around the part to be measured. The string can then be measured using a ruler. 
CLEANING / CARE:
Wipe down after use with a lightly dampened cloth or sponge. After several uses, lightly coat with the Master Leather Cream – especially around stress points such as buckle holes and hardware attachment slots.
