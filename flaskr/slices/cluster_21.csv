1097,Vintage rare Sugalite carved Quan Yin pendant. (pdgm125),"
            A pendant carved from Sugilite in the form of a graceful Quan Yin. This mini treasure is of the finest color deep (Welch’s Concord Grape Juice saturation) – a true unctuous purple. This piece is of Chinese Master Carver caliber and perfectly conveys the spirit of Quan Yin, the embodiment of compassion, mercy and kindness. Both front and reverse are different but in keeping with the theme. The design wraps entirely around the carving.
Sugilite Is a rare purple mineral that was first discovered in 1944. This material was not suitable for ornamentation and it was not until 1979 when it was re-discovered in the Southern Kalahari Desert of South Africa. In 1980 Sugilite was classified as a rare gem, which, according to supply and demand economics, resulted in a price increase. And into the next century, today prices are commensurate with the extreme rarity.
Sugilite gets its attractive purple color from traces of Manganese. It can range inn color from pinkish purple to deep bluish-purple. The most highly valued Sugilite gemstones are a uniform intense purple. A great deal of Sugilite has patches, veins or layers. This carving is the rarer intense purple variety and priced accordingly.

            This is an old faux bamboo towel rack that I found at a market here in Normandy, France. This lovely wooden rack has two rails and it attaches to the wall. You could use this rack in your kitchen or your bathroom.  
Condition: Good although there are marks and signs of age.  There is a brown spot on it which looks to me like a part of the wood.
Measurements: 23 3/4 inches wide  and the wall mounts are 8 1/4 inches in length
Combined shipping can allow you to save on shipping (in most cases) when more than one item is purchased. Just let me know if you are interested in more than one item and I can let you know how much the cost would be!
This item ships from France and takes approximately 5 business days within the EU and 12 business days everywhere else. A tracking number is included in the shipping cost.
All of the items that I sell are vintage or antique which means that they have varying degrees of wear. I try to describe any flaws that I can see but I suggest that you look at all of the photos and ask any questions that you may have regarding the item. I will be happy to answer any questions for you!

3527,"Girl's antique spring coat, early 1900's Edwardian little girl's white coat","
            This is a little girl's white cotton spring coat or jacket, that dates from the early 1900's. The fabric is a lightweight cotton with a woven white-on-white striped design. There's 1"" wide white lace sewn onto the collar and cuffs. The coat is unlined, and has 2 carved, mother-of-pearl buttons. The sleeves are gathered above the turned-up cuffs. The shoulder measurement is 12"";  the length is 20-3/4"" (measured from the shoulder);  the sleeve length is 12"". The coat was originally shorter; it has been lengthened by sewing on hem facing. You can see a faint line where the original hemline was (see photo #4). The coat is in good condition for a garment of this age, but it is not without flaws: near the hemline, at the side seam, their are 2 small cuts in the fabric (see photo #5); on the back, 3"" from the bottom, there's a pinhole (easily repairable); on the front, 3"" from the bottom, is a small (1/16"" diameter) light tan stain, which hasn't come out, even with bleach (see photo #4). Overall though, the coat is sturdy and presentable, and still wearable.        ",32.00,4.9814,"Vintage item from 1900 - 1909

5302,"Looney Tunes Animation Cel - ""Strike Up the Band"" - #373/750 - with official Warner Bros. COA - Free Shipping","
            Recently reduced from 2,500.
Pictures really do not do this animation cel justice.  Is professionally framed (150 frame) and is in mint condition.  It comes from Robert McKimson's personal animation collection, who was one of the people in charge of Warner Brother's animation department in the 40's and 50's, or the 'Golden' Era of Cartoons.  This is the only animation cel I have ever seen with this many Looney Tunes Cartoon Characters at once.
The framed cell measures 29""x 21""....it has Robert McKimson's signature on the front right corner, and on the front left it says 373/750 in felt marker.  Both COA's are on the back.  
Any questions or would like to see additional photos please ask! I can take as many as possible.
Shipping will always be quick, I live 2 blocks away from the Post Office.
Thank you for looking and please check out the rest of my store!        ","1,800.00",4.931,"Vintage item from the 1950s

5907,Vintage Pearl Collar - Pearl Beaded Collar - Detachable Collar - Sweater Accessory - Sweater Collar - Removable Collar - 1950s Fashion,"
            I love these detachable collars.  They're such a distinct way of dressing up a sweater or jacket, and this one has survived the last 50 years with less wear and tear than most of us.  :)  
The collar consists of seven rows of faux pearls, alternating with six rows of silvery bugle beads, all stitched to a white satin collar.  The collar closes in the back (or front) with two hooks.  There is no label, though these collars were generally made in Japan during this period.  There are no loose or missing pearls.
I have this listed as U.S. only; if you're outside the U.S. and interested in this item, please message me and I'll be happy to calculate shipping for you.        ",14.99,4.8833,"Vintage item from the 1950s

DISCLAIMER:
I, Katie Rushing, the creator of Therapy Journals, am not a licensed therapist, psychiatrist, nurse, doctor, dietician or mental health worker, nor am I claiming to heal, cure, prevent or treat any medical/emotional/mental conditions. 
My shop is designed to provide encouragement, comfort, recognition and love to those who struggle with any type of mental health issue. 
PLEASE NOTE: Many mental health illnesses can involve intense/distressing memories and feelings. Journaling may not be suitable for everyone. It is always wise to check with your doctor or therapist before journaling. 
Each journal contains different types of pages, none of which are providing medical advice. The different types of pages are:
- Tracking/Logging: These pages are set up as blank charts/tables/spreadsheets for the purpose of tracking certain behaviors, thoughts & emotions, and recording potential growth.
- Lists: These pages contain comprehensive lists (example: emotions, thoughts, activities) and can be used as a reference sheet. 
- Guided Journaling: These pages contain questions/prompts for those who benefit from daily writing.   
- Encouragement: These sheets are designed to encourage, such as “15 ways to love your body,” and are not meant to be received as medical advice. 
The reason I created Therapy Journals is because I have spent many years in therapy for Depression, and I have been through intensive residential treatment for Bulimia, and I have developed a strong passion for those who suffer from a mental health illness. Journaling has been a very helpful tool for me, and I want to share that resource with others.

            Shower Steamer Variety Pack - Shower Steamer Variety Pack
Pack of 4 Shower Steamers
Approximately 6 oz (1.5 oz. per steamer). Each Steamer measures 2 inches wide and 1 inch heigh.
Includes one each: 
*Sweet Dreams Shower Steamer - Relaxing aromatherapy with lavender and vanilla.
*Clarity Shower Steamer - Headache aromatherapy with peppermint and eucalyptus.
*Good Morning Shower Steamer - Citrus Aromatherapy with orange, lime, tangerine, and thyme.
*Breathe Shower Steamer - Sinus Aromatherapy with menthol, eucalyptus, camphor and rosemary.
Simply allow contact with water and the tab will fizz, releasing a relaxing and calming aromatic aroma. 
*How to use*
Place shower steamer on the floor of the shower where water can easily get to it. The water will activate the steamer and the steam will carry the aroma from the essential oils throughout your shower. For best results do not place the steamer directly in the stream of water or it will dissolve quickly. For more intense aromatherapy you can place your shower steamer in a shower caddy. The closer the steamer is to you, the more of an aromatherapy experience you will have. Enjoy!

7484,"Salt Scrub, Peppermint Scrub, Foot Scrub, Foot Care","
            This Salt Scrub is as natural as possible, made with the finest grain salts I can find.  For a salt scrub, it is very smooth and not scratchy.  Blended with sweet almond oil and essential oils, it scrubs skin cells and encourages rejuvenation.  It is great on your feet, elbows or wherever you have dry skin that needs to get scrubbed off.  I even use it on my hands, when I need an especially soothing treatment.  The essential oils smell minty and therapeutic.  The salts will settle to the bottom of the jar, so periodically, give it a good stir.  The consistency is similar to applesauce and a little goes a long way.
To use:  Massage salt onto your wet skin.  Use a light touch and rinse thoroughly.  Then, either:
* Wipe dry and take care. Your skin will still be slippery because of the rich almond oil,
* Or, wash with your normal soap or cleansing routine.   
Ingredients: sea salt, baking soda, sweet almond oil, essential oils (peppermint, tea tree, lavender), colorant. Net wt. 7 oz. 
Essential oils are known to be very therapeutic:
* Peppermint - known to help with circulation
* Tea Tree - great for its anti-fungal and antiseptic qualities
* Lavender - soothes the skin and has a calming aroma
CAUTION: Remember to take extra caution when using oil-based products on your feet. Always use light cotton socks to reduce the chance of slipping. Also, the Oil Salt Scrub is made with Sweet Almond Oil which is a member of the nut family - avoid if you have allergies.
These products are not intended to treat or cure any medical condition. If you have allergies or sensitive skin, use the list of ingredients on the label and consult your physician. Do not use these products if you are unsure about the ingredients.
SHIPPING NOTE: Calculating shipping costs is tricky. If you purchase multiple items and combine shipping, I will refund any overage more than 1.00. I do not up-charge the shipping prices and will only charge you my actual costs.        ",6.50,4.9824,"Handmade item

7504,Fresh Bitten Pineapple Sugar Scrub - Pineapple Sugar Scrub - Tropical Sugar Scrub,"
            This glorious sweet fragrance is toned down beautifully by the addition of an unlikely herb: cilantro. Ripe pineapple juices are complemented with coconut shavings, bursting orange notes and sparkling cilantro. Warm vanilla and mists of musk complete this zesty aroma!
What is the difference between a regular scrub and an emulsified scrub? A regular scrub contains just a material to exfoliant, like sugar or salt, sitting in a pool of oils. It tends to separate in the jar, dry out, and can leave your skin feeling extra greasy because they don't absorb into the skin. On the other hand, EMULSIFIED scrubs are a creamy, ice cream like consistency that is thickened with an emulsifying wax, and has butters, oils, and nutrients that absorb into the skin, all while the sugar removes dead skin to leave your skin heavenly soft. This scrub is never greasy, and helps make the skin glow and rejuvenate it to make your skin plump and healthy.
How to Use: Use a spoon, stick, or other small utensil (I try to include in orders) to place a small amount on the desired, damp area of skin. Gently rub in circular motions to remove the dead skin and work the oils and butters into your skin. Rinse off with warm water and enjoy!

Note: Color may be slightly different between batches. Although there is a preservative, try to limit the amount of water that enters the jar to avoid mold: a spoon is recommended instead of your finger. Do not eat, even though it smells delicious enough to!

8281,Lavender Cedarwood Deodorant Balm - Natural Deodorant - Organic Deodorant - featured in the book Plastic Free - Vegan 2 oz,"
            This is a natural deodorant balm in a 2 oz container.  It was made with Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Arrow Root Powder, Candelilla Wax, and non GMO soy based Vitamin E and an herbaceous woody blend of French High Altitude Lavender essential oil and Cedarwood essential oil. This is a vegan deodorant.  I have found it lasts all day long and even into the next day. I have previously tried using powdered deodorant formulations made by others with baking soda and have found them to be irritating. This balm form helps balance the baking soda with conditioning Cocoa Butter and Olive oil. 
A small percentage of people may experience allergy or irritation from the baking soda. Based on feedback from customers we think that micro traumas from shaving or waxing may predispose the skin to sensitivity to baking soda. Therefore, use with care after shaving, for example shave at night and apply deodorant in the morning. If you would like to test this deodorant in a smaller container before using it, you can find it in the samples section of my shop.

            Elegant Hair Pins made with natural raw titanium plated multiple color quartz crystals.
Length of pins with stones -  about 4  inches (pin itself without a crystal is 3'' long)
Sold by one. You will receive similar to the ones on the pictures. There are no two identical crystals, but they are all alike and beautiful!
Please note, the amount of pins necessary to hold hair tight is different for every type and length of hair. I do mine with 4-5 pins :) Sometimes it works better to use a hair tie on pony, and then twist it and finish with some pins <3 
These pins can be used for updos, buns, half buns, or braided into hair.

TESTIMONIALS
*****************************
Really surprised with this face cleanser, I have combination skin (quite oily and quite dry)- and it makes for a difficult time finding a good cleanser to clear out my pores without over drying my skin (which then makes me over produce oil and break out). 
My face felt clean but not sucked of all the natural oils.
Unbelievably fast shipping! I love this soap too, it's one of my favorite face soaps ever and I've used a ton - including the really expensive brands.
Highly recommend!! I first came across it in this store, and it's fantastic!!! Thank you Melissa!!!
""I use this soap on my face and it is awesome. It smells great. I feel like I'm at a spa when I use it. It lathers well and my face feels really clean when I rinse it off.
This soap is perfect. I use it all over. It moisturizes even better than the sea salt soaps.
This soap is amazing! I've never used anything like it. And customer service/shipping was great.
L-O-V-E this soap! It smells great. Very generous size that should last me quite a while. Thanks so much - I'll definitely be back for more!
This formula is just awesome. I have a very sensitive irritated mixed combination skin but I do NOT have any problems at all using this soap!!! Thanks
This is my 5th purchase from Melissa in the last year and my first time trying out a few different soaps. I really like the activated charcoal, it has a nice, clean, smell and dries out my skin in a good way. Three Kings smells like cinnamon and spice and everything nice. The other bars that I ordered (rosemary and lavender mixes) smell very herbal, a bit overwhelmingly so. That's probably fine if you like herbs and aromatherapy. I do have to say, Melissa makes the BEST lip balms. (Peppermint ice and lavender mint = amazing) I have been using her lip balms exclusively for the last year and they last forever. :)
This soap is fantastic. It smells refreshing and invigorating, and it feels positively wonderful on your skin. I'm so happy I purchased this. It will definitely become a staple in my soap collection.
Wow... what a wonderful experience.... ordering more
I love this product so far!

10642,You Can Do Anything Personalized CD - Your Child's Name Used 106 Xs in This Lively & Fun CD.  Songs that'll make you want to dance,"
            The ""You Can Do Anything"" CD is lively, upbeat and has a positive message.  The songs are fun-loving and encourage the child to sing and dance along. Check out the track listing below.
1. You Can Do Anything
2. Way Too Much To Do
3. Simon Says
4. If They Put You In Charge Of The Zoo
5. All Because Of You
6. In Your Own Backyard
7. Junk Food Flavored Healthy Veggie Treats
8. Tomorrow
I love the positive message of this CD. If you were watching this CD for Adam, some of the lyrics in the first song are, ""You can do anything that you can dream, Adam, run and climb, just laugh and smile and sing, Adam. We can do anything, so come with me. We'll learn to be brave; we'll grow to be strong, together as friends we'll travel along....come on!! You can do anything that you can dream, Adam.....""
The track of Simon Says is really cute. It's like the game of Simon says, but the child's name has to be sung in the track instead of Simon. This track will have your child on their feet dancing right along as their name is used over and over. The song says, ""Remember, only do the actions when you hear your name"".
Consider a personalized CD for your next birthday gift, or Christmas or just anytime you want to bless that special child in your life. Remember, gifts like this won't be found at any of the retail toy stores, or discount houses. This will be a unique gift, something they'll treasure always.
To find your child's name, look at the list below. If you can't find the name you’re looking for, look under different spelling choices. If you find the name you're looking for, but it's not spelled correctly, that’s no problem. I make each CD when it's ordered, so I'll make sure to spell it correctly on the label. You can also add a personalized message on the label. If you want to make the CD a keepsake, make sure to fill out the message line when you order. It can be up to 3 lines long.

14312,"Candle Dye 1 Oz Liquid Candle Color, Candle Wax Dye, Sample Set, Black, Blue, Green, Ivory, Pink, Purple, Red, Yellow","
            Liquid candle dye in easy to use dropper bottles. Eight vibrant colors: black, blue, green, ivory, pink, purple, red and yellow available in 1 oz. bottles. Sample set contains 5 ml. bottles in 5 colors: blue, green, purple, red and yellow. Photos show samples of colors in different wax types using an average of 2-6 drops per pound. Use more or less of a color or blend different colors for endless possibilities. Fragrance oils vary in color; some are clear, yellow, tan etc.; so please make notes in your formulations of variations as you test. 
Approved for use with all types of wax including palm, paraffin, soy and blends. Used for creating candles, wax melts / tarts and aroma beads. 
Select quantity from drop menu along with your choice of 1 ounce (30 ml) color selection or 5 ml color sample set. All are packaged in amber glass bottles with dropper tops. 
Each of the 5 sample bottles in the set contains 5 ml of liquid dye x 5 colors for a total of 25 ml (0 .8 oz). 5 ml conversions = 1/6th oz = 1 teaspoon = 100 drops. Most folks choose the sample set to start with since 1 ounce of color tints approximately 100 pounds of wax; that's a lot of candles. 
 IMPORTANT NOTES:
* To order the sample set select Size '5 ml' and 'Rainbow' color.
* Store in cool environment away from direct sunlight and out of reach of children and pets. Shake before use.
* Protect your work area!! Dye may stain surfaces. Wear gloves or wash ASAP for skin contact.
* Add color after wax has reached recommended melt temperature and before pour temperature; so basically the same time you add fragrance oil. 
* Expect color changes as wax cools. Most dry to lighter shades.
* Ingredients in colorants are protected by proprietary laws. We suspect they are oil based since they're a bit smelly and can mix with wax, thus oils. No worries about the smell impacting your finished candles as it's a tiny percentage of the formulation. 
******************************************************************
FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
Q: Can I select different colors in the sample set?
A: Sorry, no. These are pre-packed for quick process & shipping. Set includes blue, green, purple, red & yellow. 
Q: Do you discount for multiple quantities?
A: Yes. Order 10 or more items from our ‘Craft Supply DIY’ section to receive 20% off list price for all locations. All 10 do not have to be the same, okay to select all different to get to the discounted volume of units. Listings sold as sets count as 1 item. Click on this link to shop items that qualify.

Once 10 or more items are in your cart enter coupon code SUPPLY20 during checkout for instant savings. Orders not meeting the qualifying 10 items will be cancelled. 
Q: Do you have other colors available?
A: Sorry, No. We only stock colors we use. 
Q: What's the difference in liquid VS colored wax chips?
A: Liquid is MUCH EASIER to produce consistent color in your wax recipes by controlling amount of drops added per pound. Wax chips need to be cut and weighed, not easy to do unless you have a scale that measures in grams for small batches or pastel colors. We make lots of candles and much happier with liquid dye.
Q: Can I use powdered dye?
A: Only if candles are for decorative purposes!!! Powdered dye is combustible, NOT recommended for candles you intend to burn.
Q: Can I use these for other applications like clay, soap, etc.?
A: We cannot provide additional details for use in crafting outside our area of expertise. We also make soap, but honestly never tried using these as we  have other options approved for soap use.

In 2005 the Sajou brand was purchased and revived by avid collector; Frederique Crestin- Billet.

https://www.etsy.com/listing/463811325/45-feet-certified-organic-hemp-wick-with?ref=shop_home_active_1
Made of 100% organic, raw, Hemp twine saturated and cured in 100%, USDA Organic Certified beeswax. 
Hand Made in Corvallis Oregon
•Other wicks are made using ""natural"" beeswax. This Product is made using only USDA Certified Organic Beeswax.
This wick contains no fillers, chemicals or impurities. It burns hot and it burns clean, and contains no butane flavors or toxic sulfurs, making for a healthier and tastier smoking experience.
The spectrum of light from burning beeswax is identical to that of the sun. Used for thousands of years by cultures worldwide for art, candles and preserving twine, beeswax does not deteriorate over time, and will never go rancid or rot. 
* Better for your Health: Hemp Wicks eliminate foul tasting and unhealthy lighter fumes produced by traditional lighters, which often contain traces of butane and metals in flint dust.
* Superior Taste: Hemp Wicks provide a clean burning flame (no chemical tastes) for the smoking connoisseur, allowing you to totally enjoy the full flavors of your favorite smoking blends.
* Cooler Flame: Hemp Wick creates a flame that burns cooler than the flame from a standard lighter, resulting in a less damaging, more flavorful smoke.
* Environmentally Friendly: Hemp Wicks will prolong the life of your other lighters, reducing the amount of lighters being sent to landfills each year.

15755,Mini DIY Farmers' Cheese Kit- 3-5 batches (cow milk),"
            It may be teenie* but this Mini Farmers’ Cheese Kit is packed with fun and cheesy possibilities.  This cheese is fittingly rustic and very adaptable. It can vary from ricotta to feta in flavor and texture. You can use it creamy, firm, sweet or savory - the instructions will guide you! 
KIT INCLUDES: 
 - Instructions with Tips and Variations
 - Unlimited Email Support as Needed
 - Fine Mesh, 100% Cotton Cheesecloth also known as Butter Muslin
 - Gluten-free, Non-GMO Citric Acid
 - Pure, Non-Iodized Flake Salt
WHAT YOU NEED:
Simply add milk and in under an hour you will be eating and sharing your very own fresh cheese! No aging required!  Pasteurized store-bought or raw farm-fresh milk both work.  Make sure your store bought milk is not ultra-pasteurized or UHT, ultra-heat pasteurized. 
DIETARY GUIDELINES:
The Mini Farmers’ Cheese Kit is gluten-free, Non-GMO and vegetarian friendly.
QUANTITY:
The Mini Farmers Cheese Kit makes 3 batches of cheese. A batch is about 1 lb so you will have plenty of supplies to try your hand at not only making the cheese but experimenting with different flavors, shapes and recipes. Use bowls, cupcake tins etc. as molds at home.
GOOD TO KNOW:
One of the many unique characteristics of this cheese is that it doesn't melt, so you can actually pan-fry cubes for a browned, crispy, chewy, crazy good treat. Use it instead of croutons on a crisp green salad, fry it like an egg for an amazing sandwich, replace meat or tofu in any dish or just dip cubes as appetizers in a delicious sauce (BBQ, plum, pesto, salsa...) You can make a veggie dip, ricotta cheesecake, mix with jam and top pancakes, use it savory to fill pasta shells, dollop onto chili, layer in lasagna, or crumble onto salads like feta.
The possibilities are endless!
FOOD SAFETY AND HANDLING: 
The kits and supplies are hand-poured, hand-folded and assembled in a food-safe, fully-licensed facilities that strictly follow the Department of Agriculture cleaning guidelines. The food items are all gluten-free but packaged in a room that may come in contact with wheat, soy, corn, nuts and other food allergens.  
SHELF LIFE for the Mini Farmers’ Cheese Kit is 5 years.
