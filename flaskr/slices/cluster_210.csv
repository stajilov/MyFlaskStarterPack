1413,Wood and Marble Board Game,"
            Awesome, awesome wood and marble board game. I don't know what this game is called, but it's the one where you jump marbles and take the jumped marbles off. The goal is to have one marble left on the board. You can only jump forward, backwards, left and right. What's cool is you put the marbles in the little hidden compartments. One of the doors to the compartments in sharded. This one was made by Berea College Crafts at Berea College in Berea, Kentucky. There is a faint wood burning on the bottom that barely says Berea College, Berea, KY. Marbles not included.

            Little helper tower / step stool for toddler which can be easily converted to table and chair.
After helping mom in the kitchen to peel potatoes and prepare dinner, little helper can be tired. Helper tower can be easily converted to table and chair, so little helper can take a rest, or have some fun with the toys, or maybe enjoy just prepared dinner at his own table!
Please, see the video on how surdy the stools are. Everybody deserves their own helper tower - https://youtu.be/5CG_kI5VJ-s
To see how the learning tower can be folded into table / chair, see this video: https://youtu.be/uWjQpH1_Nms
Little helper convertible step stool / table / chair:
 handmade from 15mm (0.59'') birch plywood, so stable and hardy to hold a toddler;
 Treated with water based lacquer or colored with water based paint, so no chemistry and kid's safe!
 Dimensions - learning tower overall height 90cm (35.43''), step platform just in the middle 45cm (17.72'') height. Platform dimensions - 28 x 40 cm (11.02'' x 15.75'').
 Learning / helper tower easily bends in the middle and converts to table and chair;
 Safe locks at the side secures both learning tower and table / chair positions;
 Very comfortable in limited living spaces - you don't need to find a space for learning / helper tower, table and chair separately. All-in-one!
 The wallet will be satisfied as well - it is much more economical than buying learning / helper tower, table and chair separately :)
