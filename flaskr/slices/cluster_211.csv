965,"Antique 10K Coral Acorn Earrings, Victorian Coral earrings, Victorian Pierced Earrings, Fine Estate Jewelry, Acorn Jewelry, Coral Jewelry","
            ""Great Oaks From Little Acorns Grow"" ... The Victorians associated the acorn with power, authority and victory. But on the more sentimental side it is also a statement of longevity, strong new growth and new life.
What a stroke of luck to find yet another pair of endearing Victorian coral acorn pierced earrings. This tiny pair features a chased 10K gold cap with a coral bead to mimic the acorn. They retain their original 10K ear wires which will best suite a smaller ear lobe with an opening of 3/8'' at their widest point.
The earrings are petite measuring 3/4'' from the top of the wire to the bottom of the coral. The acorn is about 3/8'' x 1/4''. They are in lovely condition.        ",265.00,4.9541,"Vintage item from the 1800s

            Our Victorian Love Token Charm Bracelet was created with love using coins that date as far back as 1875. Back in the days before the Mall or gift stores when family and loved ones offered gifts of the heart. These authentic antique coins have been sanded, smoothed and engraved with personal messages of initials and tiny birds. One coin is engraved with a bird sitting in the rain holding an umbrella.
There are seven coins in all on this bracelet and one that I find to be quite fascinating with initials engraved into the open pages of a book. The 8-1/2'' buckle style bracelet is 3/8'' wide. It can be fastened at 2 levels and retains its original slide clasp. This circa 1877 bracelet is hand made from a thin band of silver and embellished with simple etchings.
This precious Victorian keepsake has not been polished and exhibits age appropriate wear. I would love to keep this for myself.        ",275.00,4.9541,"Vintage item from the 1800s

14300,"Indigo Dye Vat Collection, Pre Reduced Indigo, Henna, and Lime","
            Dyeing fibre with indigo is a magical experience. Gently heat your indigo vat ingredients in water and watch the bath turn from blue to pale greenish yellow as the oxygen is removed. Dip your fibres in and watch them change from greenish yellow to indigo blue as they get exposed to oxygen. I never get tired of seeing the transformation! 
This kit includes:
10g of pre reduced indigo
20g of henna 
30g of lime (calcium hydroxide)
Each comes in a glass jar.
All you need is water, natural fibres of your choice, and a pot to get an indigo vat going!
Although no mordant is needed for indigo dyeing, indigo must be combined with something to increase the pH (lime) and something to remove all the oxygen from the dye vat (henna). This will allow the indigo to become water soluble and adhere to the fibre. 
10g of indigo (along with 20g of henna and 30g of lime) will dye ~1200g of fibre a pale to medium shade and 600g fibre a medium to dark shade. 
As with most natural dyes, the colours will be stronger on protein fibres such as wool or silk. Indigo on cellulose fibres like cotton and linen tend to be paler and more subdued. Synthetic fibres tend not to take up natural dyes.

15214,Decorative White Birch Fireplace Logs/6 Piece Set/2-3 Inch Diameters/16 Inch Lengths/ Home Décor/Shipping Included: Item# BL-4110,"
            White Birch Fireplace Logs!  6 Piece Set! SHIPPING IS INCLUDED IN THE PRICE!!
Our Decorative White Birch Logs are harvested in Northern Wisconsin.  The White Birch has an exfoliating “paper-type” bark. The white birch bark is white with black markings and can have a mixture of colors such as cream, brown and caramel.
Not every birch tree looks the same and the photos shown are examples. What we do with each set of logs is take the variations and match them so that each set of logs look like they belong together. Please note that colors and variations may vary from set to set.  Each set of birch logs also have a mixture of diameters ranging from the 2 inch to 3 inch.
These logs are all natural and have not been treated or preserved with chemicals or insecticides. These logs have not been ""touched up"" and may have natural ""scuffs and scratches"". 
If you have a fireplace that you would like to fill with logs.... like shown in photo Two.... send us a custom request. We currently have ""special pricing available and can send you a quote!!
This listing is for:
(6) White Birch Logs
Product Dimensions:
16 inches long
Approximately: 2""-3"" Large End Diameters
This is a ""made-to-order"" item and ships in 3-5 days.  We will do our best to ship sooner without compromising quality.
