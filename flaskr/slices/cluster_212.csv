            As featured on Emmaline Bride!
http://emmalinebride.com/themes/state-ideas/
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This listing is for an Ohio necklace.  I cut a heart out of the area over Rocky River but I can put the heart over any area you prefer. I can also cut out a star, or other shape if you like.  
When designing our hometown jewelry, we take care to be as accurate as possible with all the little nooks and crannies of the outline.  Since the silhouette is the only thing that makes the piece recognizable, we take care not to over sand and polish the detailed edge.
♥Please make sure to indicate where to place the heart.  Otherwise, it will be over Cleveland.♥
Ohio State Necklace Pendant Sizing Options
-STANDARD SIZE - .75 x .7 inches (19 x 18 mm)
-PETITE SIZE - .6 x .55 inches (15 x 14 mm)
Other Details
-Sterling Silver Pendant
-Sterling Silver flat cable chain
-Brushed Matte finish
