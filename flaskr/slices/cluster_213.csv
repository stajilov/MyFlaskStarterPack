1764,Vintage Tapestry Made in France  #2,"
            This European tapestry features an intricate 1700's scene with a man and woman talking to another woman who may be a servant or a peasant.  There is a dog in the scene and a young boy in the background with reins or a rope in his hands.  
Note:  The first two photos were done for close-up purposes and tend to show a bit lighter than the actual colors.
The setting is on a grand terrace that sits on a lake front.  On the lake are several sailboats and gondolas.  On the other side of the lake is a city vista with an arched bridge.
There is a stamped mark on the back that reads Made in France.
This piece measures 34"" x 35"" and it is in perfect condition with no stains or tears whatsoever.  It is smoke free.
Grab this now for your collection, to frame, or to use for upholstery or make into a beautiful center piece pillow for your home.        ",36.95,4.9848,"Vintage item from the 1920s

2193,Vintage bakelite bangle - cherry red bakelite bangle - carved bakelite bangle - 1930s bakelite bangle - 1940s bakelite bangle,"
            This vintage cherry red bakelite bangle has beautiful hand carving.  There are a couple of tiny chips (see picture) right on the edge of the bangle, and also a tiny yellow mark (see picture).  This is a stunning and very wearable 1930s or 1940s bangle!  I believe the bangle to be bakelite, especially as it has the tiny chips which often indicate bakelite, and also the yellow mark.  However, as it hasn't been tested I have priced accordingly.

3899,SALE Daguerreotype Photo Octagonal Union Case Photo of Man c 1860,"
            **SALE  Price Reduced from 110 to 89
Wonderful octagonal daguerreotype photo case with a photo of a man inside. There is a paper inside that came with this, it had the name Moses Dudley, and most likely is the identification of the man inside. This is in very good condition both the case and the inside - fabric, frame, glass, photo, everything is intact and was well cared for. The outside has a lovely detailed pattern of scrolls and fancy designs.   This image is on both the front and back sides.  
The case also referred to as a Union Case was made by Littlefield, Parsons, & Co. According to the insert which is under the photo, it claims they are ""the sole proprietors and only legal manufacturers of Union Cases with the Embracing Riveted Hinge. Patented October 14, 1856 and April 21, 1857.""
Dates ca 1860.
This closes securely and the hinges and closure are in nice shape. There are only a couple tiny nicks in the case - which is amazing - please view last photo to view.  The fabric inside is clean and looks pristine as does everything.  The case is made of a thermoplastic used during this time period.
Case in the closed position, measures 2 1/2"" x 3"".  It is approx 5/8"" depth.
The man (Moses Dudley?), has very hand tinted cheeks - almost in a clown like manner. On the other side of the paper that was tucked in the case, besides the name, it has written ""Silver Spoons made before Civil War"". Don't know anything about the silver spoons! ...  
Lovely antique keepsake.
Enjoy!        ",89.00,4.983,"Vintage item from the 1800s
