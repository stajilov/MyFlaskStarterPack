This is how i actually got started in making Organic Beauty Products! I was addicted to high end Mascaras that could make your eyelashes look Extra thick and Long! I tried exspensive Products and got tired of paying so much money. So i was searching for products that made my eyelashes LONG that i could afford and make myself and came across some recipes on Pinterest and after researching and testing i came up with this concoction. The Biotin is a definite Booster and the GenTeal lubricant is a double Booster on top of the amazing Oils already in this recipe. I have tried just about everything out there and this recipe Rocks! You have to stick with it and you will see results.  Take a before and after picture of your eyelashes. Great for eyebrows too! I have to trim my eyebrows because this potion makes them grow like weeds! 
Ingredients:
Biotin
Mineral Oil and Petroleum and lanolin is the only ingredient that is not organic but it gives the serum such an amazing Lash & Brow Boost of Hair growth!! Please specify if you do not wish to have this added to your Serum but it helps.

Fractionated Coconut Oil
Vitamin E
Rosemary Extract
Lavender Oil
Lemon Oil

This magic Eyelash Serum really Works! I make it with high end Organic Hair stimulating Ingredients because i want it to work faster. You apply it on your eyelashes and the water line of your eye at night before you go to bed and let it do it's magic while you sleep! You will see results in about 2 to 3 weeks everyone has different body chemistry so u may see results sooner. This is a inexpensive way to grow your eyelashes and eyebrows! You will LOVE this Serum! The essential oils help smooth out fine lines and wrinkles too..so it's a win a win!

9008,Stretch Mark Cream handmade with Pure High Quality Organic butters waxes and essential Oils. You will see Results. Helps fade scars too!,"
            For best results I recommend exfoliating in the shower first to remove dead skin build up then get out of shower  lightly dry off your skin and while is skin is still damp then apply my Stretch mark Cream to stretch marks or all over body. I make a blood orange body polish to exfoliate. here is link

WHAT IS A STRETCH MARK??
Stretch Marks form when the skin is stretched very quickly.  Stretch marks are most common in growing teenagers and pregnant women.  Basically when the skin stretches it begins to rip and forms a scar.  
This homemade stretch mark cream contains ingredients that are fabulous for your skin including coconut oil, cocoa butter, and vitamin E oil and more. The cocoa butter in this homemade stretch mark cream is a natural moisturizer with amazing properties. For example, it is rich in antioxidants that can help heal scars, scratches, and yes, stretch marks. Seeing is believing and you will see! I am happy with my personal results i have a Big Ugly scar and stretch marks on my lower stomach area and they used to be a medium brown color but now it's clear with a pink tint. It's really almost invisible. Take a before and picture to see your results. Good Luck to You my friends. 
Additional Tip to get Better faster results! - Is to EXFOLIATE First if you can...like Exfoliate when your in the Shower and when you get out and you are still damp then apply my Stretch Mark Cream. You will get better faster results. Your still going to fade your stretch marks but this is a good additional step if you can. otherwise just keep applying Cream as much as you can. What you put into it you will surely get back! Excited to see how you do...please let me know.  
My skin has improved so much since i started using my Body Butters especially Body Butters with essential Oils that target scars, stretch marks and problem areas. I really do get compliments on my legs and skin now! My husband said i looked more defined and i am not working out so it has to be the Body Butters and my friend told me i had nice legs! I loved it! lol Like with anything you have to stick with it to get great results and i honestly apply Body Butter to my skin all day long when i am at Home because I am always making these wonderful products so i do have an advantage in being able to apply this on my body all day. My Skin has never looked so good! Thank You Mother nature.  I LOVE IT!

INGREDIENTS
Neroli Essential Oil is a powerful oil that helps reduce the appearance of stretch marks and scars, it is cicatrisant which means it has anti scarring properties!  Neroli oil also stimulates circulation and encourages cell regeneration!
Helichrysum Essential Oil is an expensive oil but it is powerful when it comes to regenerating damaged skin.  It is known for fading and healing scars and stretch marks and even surgical wounds (C-sections scars!).   It contains diketones which help reduce scar tissue and stimulate growth of new skin tissue!  This is one powerful essential oil!
Lavender Essential Oil is healing and calming.  It also nourishes broken, cracked skin.
Lemon Essential Oil can lighten the appearance of scars and stretch marks.
Vitamin E Oil is moisturizing and highly nourishing.  It also prolongs the life of your butter.
Sweet Almond Oil contains vitamins A and E.  It contains a large amount of antioxidants which help skin appear younger.
Coconut Oil is extremely healing. It is full of antioxidants and Vitamin E.
Cocoa Butter is famous for protecting the skin from stretch marks.  It is highly nourishing and penetrates to the lower epidermis of the skin.
Shea Butter helps rebuild collagen which is broken down when the skin ages or becomes damaged.
Beeswax thickens your butter as well as provides a protective barrier that holds moisture in the skin.
I know what it feels like to have your skin stretch and stretch and stretch!  I’m willing to admit that I’m vain.  I had many moments where worry and fear took over.  It seemed at times that my skin was going to just rip.  Not to mention the itchy discomfort.  I faithfully used a body butter to relieve the discomfort and to reduce the risk of stretch marks and this helped to ease my mind significantly.  The thing about stretch marks is that you can reduce the risk of getting them by keeping the skin well hydrated and nourished but heredity plays a big roll.  If your mom has stretch marks from pregnancy you most likely will too.  The good news is that you can easily relieve your skin from the discomfort of stretching and at the same time you can fade and hopefully prevent stretch marks!  I believe 100% that you must protect and “feed” your skin during this precious and trying time!  Itchy skin caused from a growing belly needs to be hydrated and protected at least once daily.  The ingredients I’ve chosen are safe and beneficial for you and your growing baby. Or if you just want to heal scars any have nice skin...you don't have to have stretch marks to enjoy this Recipe! :)        ",9.88,4.9098,"Handmade item
