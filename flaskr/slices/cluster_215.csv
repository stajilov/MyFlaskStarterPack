5421,"Vintage Southwestern Thunderbird Concho Belt 35"" Silver Tone Metal","
            This vintage belt is a total of 35"" long. It has some wear in the form of finish loss and small rust spots (see photo #4). But they are not ubiquitous, just a little here and there. Each thunderbird concho is about 1.5"" high and wide. This is light weight weighing only 3.2 ounces. The belt closes with a simple hook anywhere along it's length so it can accommodate all sizes up to about 34"". The last photo is the backside.
***This item ships in a small flat rate box. Other jewelry items can easily fit inside this box and won't raise your shipping fee at all.***        ",35.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1980s

            Soft and cuddly fleece pajamas for your pup! Keep them warm and extra cute with their own cozy dog clothes. These PJs are sewn by me and made with love. I buy my fabric in small batches, so these jammies are super unique and one-of-a-kind!
Three different neck options to choose from! Standard collar, snood (which is like a dog turtleneck), or hood (like a hooded sweatshirt). 
These sizes are pretty forgiving, as the fabric is stretchy, and also, dogs don't generally care whether their clothes fit perfectly, but please do your best to wrangle your pup and get some measurements (pro tip: bring cookies).
