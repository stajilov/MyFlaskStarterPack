9360,Hunter x Hunter License Card,"
            Update 31st Oct 2016: New method of printing will be used! (Better quality and brighter colors!)
This is a Hunter License Card from the anime Hunter X Hunter.
Great for cos-players or Hunter X Hunter fans.
Join the Hunter Association now and apply for your own Hunter License!
It is painstakingly designed in a software to reflect the anime's version, then printed and mounted on to a credit-card material card.
It is then covered with a thin film of plastic to prevent it from getting dirty easily.
SIZE:
Approx. 8.5 cm (Height)
............ 5.4 cm (Width)
Please allow me a few days to make your card(s) as the materials I use to assemble the cards all take awhile to dry.
I highly recommend buying at least two items so the shipping will be more worth it ^_^
For international customers, tracking of your shipment will be available.        ",6.29,4.8989,"Handmade item

11543,Vintage July 1952 Simplicity Patterns Counter Catalog Book 64 Years Old -- Free Shipping,"
            **No Reserving this book.**  
Here is a Simplicity pattern book ""...printed patterns"" from July 1952. It is 1"" thick, 14"" tall and 12"" wide. I'm getting rid of it because in my collecting these catalogs from 1952 to 1961, I collected 3 for the year 1952! So my loss is your gain! I do change my mind on things that I post a lot of the times and this might end up being one of them because 1952 is the year I was born!!!
I Cloroxed and laminated all my catalogs. The colored section tabs are also laminated, where the lamination from the tabs covered some of the pages the area under that yellowed . 
The front cover and back cover is in good condition, there are no tears or holes. There are spots and a few wrinkles on both covers where the color rubbed off. There are more spots on the back than the front. (See pics 1 & 2) The inside pages are in good condition with some slight yellowing on some pages.  But overall this book is in good condition for its age!
Please enlarge the pictures.
The item that you see in the pictures is the actual item that you will get. Please email me with any questions and please give me at least 24 hours to answer. I will try to answer as soon as possible.  
I will mail this item the following day after your purchase. Due to the weight (over 4 lbs.), shipping on this item is priority mail with delivery confirmation. 
Thank you for visiting my listing!
