16371,12 viola odorata,"
            VIOLA ODORATA, 12 Viola odorata root systems,Viola odorata is a species of the genus Viola native to Europe and Asia, but has also been introduced to North America and Australasia. It is commonly known as Sweet Violet, English Violet, Common Violet, or Garden Violet. The herb is known as Banafsa, Banafsha or Banaksa in India, where it is commonly used as remedy to cure sore throat and tonsilitis. The sweet, unmistakable scent of this flower has proved popular throughout the generations, particularly in the late Victorian period, and has consequently been used in the production of many cosmetic fragrances and perfumes. The French are also known for their violet syrup, most commonly made from an extract of violets. In the United States, this French violet syrup is used to make violet scones and marshmallows, According to ancient legend the name 'viola' came from the name of the maiden Io. Zeus loved the young damsel, but in order to protect her from his jealous wife, he changed Io into a young heifer, which fed in a field of violets. Violets throughout the centuries consequently became linked with love and have featured in various plays, including Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, in which Puck used their scented essence to create the lovers' potion.

Please read a little about sola flowers from my policies page ~
~Colors may vary from what you see online due to different dye lots, monitors, uploads from cameras and lighting.
~ Sola flowers are each handmade from soft, pliable tapioca wood and there may be slight imperfections in them due to the fact that they are made from very soft wood. These imperfections resemble tiny bits of bark or occasionally and small hole. Some are similar to an organic flower with imperfections such as a bug hole or tiny tear in a petal. They will vary in shape and size due to being individually handmade.

            Classic Rose Sola Flowers - SET OF 10 
These Classic Rose Sola Flowers are approximately 6cm or 2.5"" inches in diameter.  They are a light ivory or cream in color.  They have a small stem on the back that you can easily put a wire through for garlands or for adding a longer stem to.
Sola flowers are not fresh flowers.  They are handmade with shavings from tapioca or balsa tree bark.  Because they are handmade, and made from natural materials, no two are exactly alike.  Some brown veining are on some of the flowers due to being made from the bark of a tree.  I carefully pack these for shipping, but sometimes small tears or broken petals may occur due to shipping.  Even if this happens, the flowers are still beautiful and usable!
Sola flowers are great for many crafts. Perfect for diy projects that you can do months before your event because these flowers are not fresh flowers and they last for years!  There are endless ways to use them.  Use them in wedding bouquets, corsages, boutonnieres, centerpieces, wreaths, napkin rings...
