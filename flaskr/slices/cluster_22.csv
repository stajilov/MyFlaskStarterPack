            Our harem style baby shorts were developed when Jordan, owner & mom of boy/girl twins, got tired of retiring mass amounts of expensive baby pants after just a couple weeks of wear!  Our unique harem style fit features soft & stretchy cotton waist and cuff bands, a longer crotch and versatile legs that can be scrunched up or stretched out as baby grows.  Our harem style shorts grow with your baby!
We hand select our classic & timeless print collections to coordinate with just about any style, so parents end up loving our harem leggings just as much as their little ones do!  Sorry, their not available in adult sizes yet!! ;)
Since our harem style baby shorts are designed with the versatility to fit a much wider age range, our sizes run from 0-6 months, 6-12 months, 12-24 months, 2T-3T, and in most cases will fit baby far beyond each age span ... which means baby has more time to wear, and you have more time to love!  These shorts are crafted from a soft, stretchy cotton / spandex / polyester blend.
These shorts were handcrafted from designer textiles in Newport, Rhode Island.

It is a scarlet red plane replica, made of alloy.Is was made in China in the mid nineties.It's got an open cockpit and a silver grid over it, a silver front part and a black and yellow propeller, which moves. 
It also has some white paint at the end of the tail and white stars in a blue circle on the wings.The wheels underneath are black, made of plastic, they are  not moving, too.
It is about 17cm long and  4cm high ( 6.69 '' x 1.57 '' ). It is very light. It would make a terrific mobile along with a couple more planes like it.

The photo pendant is 1” round or 1” square.
The urn is app. 1 3/4” in length and app. 1/2” in diameter
The name charm is 1/2” in diameter
You choose the extra charm from the listing chart
ADD A MATCHING GIFT TIN. Great quality rust free gift tin with matching photo on lid can be added to your order....chose when selecting your pendant shape choice. See the 4th photo for sample. Chelsea is featured in this photo and has become my angel spirit dog on this journey. Her family has become an extension of my own and I love you all very much!
How to place your order:
During check out select choice of shape and charm from the drop down menus. In the notes section tell me the pet’s name. Send your photo to me by convo or directly to my email. We can discuss any details at that point.
*******Just a mention to the sweet cat and dog photos in these samples:
Cooper was an amazing Pug and Harry an equally amazing cat owned by friends of mine. They are so missed by their owners and I thank them for allowing me to use their photos.
RIP Cooper & Harry.
** Care **
Though it is water resistant it is not completely waterproof so I advise cleaning, if needed, with a damp cloth only. Do not immerse. Care instructions are included with each piece. All materials are nickel & lead free and the urn is safe for food items/pills.
** Processing Time **
All custom photo pieces ship out within 48 hours of receiving order unless noted. Once I receive your photos I will edit them to fit the item ordered and will send you the finalized photo for you to approve or make changes.
** Photos tips**
In most cases your photo will be reduced in size so the resolution may change. It's best to have contrasting backgrounds. If the subject/s in your photo are dark the background should be lighter, if they are light the background should be darker. Photos do not have to be professional...even photos taken with your phone can work out well. If you're not sure just send me what you have and we'll make it work. 
Never hesitate to ask any questions. If you have an idea for something that I do not have listed feel free to talk to me about it        ",17.00,4.9961,"Handmade item

Custom Wood Nursery Letters. Pretty Baby Room Decor!
These custom nursery letters are not for sale............but I can create something similar just for you!
Pretty sparkly glitter paper and dainty little flowers and rhinestones make this letter great for this little girls nursery.
Pricing is for each letter. We have several sizes to choose from:
6"" - 9.00
10"" - 17.00
13"" - 22.00
16"" - 30.00
18"" - 50.00
There are lots of other shops out there who do customized letters, but mine are a little different. I embellish them a little bit more and add an extra personal touch to customize them just for you. 
The ribbon or jute will be placed accordingly for the name to hang properly.
I can decorate these letter sets in your favorite colors and coordinate with your room decor, bedding, and theme. If possible, please send me a picture so I can coordinate with your existing  bedroom items!
I typically use a mix of solids, stripes, polka dots, and shaped patterns. I finish off the letters with a multitude of cute and pretty embellishments including - but not limited to: flowers, rhinestones, charms, wood shapes or figures, paint and ribbons or jute.
In this display I used small letters (3"") to create the name 'Hadley' stacked on the main first initial.  These are 4.00 each and include all embellishments. Wood is painted silvery gray and then I used soft shades of teal, gray, white and hot pink  but you can choose any name, with any color combination. 
Choose your main font at checkout or we can cut any shape or letter font so if you have something in mind, just let us know!
Pricing is for each letter. Additional decorated small letters are 4.00 each.
Embellishments used are included in the price. If you prefer certain types (i.e buttons only, no flowers, bows, etc.) just let me know at the time of purchase. I will do my best to accommodate your preferences!
Please contact me if you have questions regarding this item.
Very sweet decoration, covered with that special touch to make it perfect for you.
This is a nice gift  and perfect for a children's or nursery room wall ornament and/or decoration for the door.

8442,THE WALKING DEAD Comic Book 3-D Letters- Made to Order,"
            These letters are a HUGE hit for all those Walking Dead fans out there (including my husband and I)! We love to be able to create these letters for fellow fans! You can order one letter, initials, or even full names and words! 
The letters themselves are Paper Mache 3-D letters, that can stand by themselves, or can easily be hung on the wall. Our standard letters only have the front and sides covered because most are hung up on the wall, but I have created an option to have the front and backs covered if you are displaying them on a shelf. **Dimensions: 8 x 5.5 x 1 inches**
We up-cycle old issues of TWD comic book pages to create these one of a kind master pieces. Each letter is handmade by us, meaning no two letters look exactly the same! We do take special requests on characters you might like to see, and depending on the letters you order we do our best to make it happen! (Keep in mind that some letters have more space for characters, and we do our best to make sure each comic page matches up with the letters chosen). 
It takes approximately 1-2 weeks to get orders shipped out, but we are happy to do a rush order for an extra charge. Please message me for details! 
**Please specify in the notes upon purchase the letters you are ordering**
We can't wait to begin with your custom WALKING DEAD letters! Don't forget to add on a matching Walking dead light switch cover for just 5 =]
**We can do just about any theme you'd like to match with your decor! We love doing custom orders. If you have a particular theme you're wanting, please don't hesitate to message me. If its in a comic book, we can create it!        ",13.00,4.92,"Handmade item

**A FEW NOTES**
- Those pregnant or breastfeeding should not use this blend, as the side effects of many essential oils are not fully known due to lack of clinical testing. 
- This is an all-natural product made with sterilized equipment and no natural or chemical preservatives. For best results, store in a cool, dark place and use within six months of purchase. Make sure to leave the perfume tightly capped between uses, as adding dirt or water to any preservative-free product could introduce some yucky bacteria into the mix. 
PRO TIP: if a natural product looks or smells off, discontinue use.

The decks consists of 36 traditional Lenormand cards that come in a black metal tin with a small brochure. There are 2 additional cards for the Man and Woman cards for your preference.
Clair de Lune Lenormand is a deck illustrated and created by me. Based on the famous 36 card Lenormand oracle. The deck stays true to the traditional imagery, yet adding a side of  veiled mystery with its fairytale style illustration.
The imagery takes place under moonlight. Shrouded by the night, each card is illuminated by yellow and blue tones giving the sense of the ever present moon.
The artwork is done in the traditional technique that is known in etching, maintaining a consistent style of storybook feel.
Card size is 2.25"" x 3.5 (bridge size deck).

10497,"Contact Microphone - high quality, durable construction.  3 foot cable with 1/4"" plug","
            A durable, versatile contact microphone constructed of professional grade components.  This hand made mic was designed to perform to high standards while enduring the rigors of road use and a wide range of applications.  It is made with a 27mm brass piezo disc, Audio Technica mic cable, and a professional gold-plated 1/4"" mono plug.  The piezo disc is double dipped in rubberized paint to improve solder joint strength and provide water resistance.  Finally, a short length of heat shrink tubing is shrunk around the cable to prevent any peeling of the rubber paint.
These contact mics can be taped or clamped to any surface to create audio from any source of vibrations.  Affix one to a bottle and use for percussion, tape one to the body of your guitar to pick up unique tones.  Use them in any live setting and they're highly resistant to feedback.  My contact mics also work well as drum triggers.  The possibilities are endless!
Contact mics can be made to order, i.e. with 1/8"" plug, a female jack, or with different cable lengths.  Message me with any requests or questions.        ",17.00,4.7143,"Handmade item

 To guide you through this process, please read all the following information, then feel free to contact me with any questions. I am always happy to help and will get back to you quickly.
Pricing:
My napkins are sold in quantities of 50, if you choose 1, you will be purchasing 50 napkins, 2 will be 100, 3 will be 150... etc.
Beverage size napkins - 17 per 50 napkins
Luncheon size napkins - 20 per 50 napkins
1) Date you need your order – I usually ship within 5 - 7 days of payment, but want to be sure your order is to you in time for your event.
2) Napkin color – I use high quality 3-ply napkins. Beverage size is 5” x 5”. Luncheon size is 6 1/2"" x 6 1/2"". Both sizes are available in 27 colors. Matching napkin colors to event colors can be a challenge. If you require an exact color match, please contact me and I will be happy to send you free napkin samples in the mail. You may choose different napkin colors in quantities of 50. Please note: the napkins in the photos have been printed on beverage napkins. If you are ordering luncheon napkins, there will be more open space around the printed image.
3) Print color- Choose a print color that has as much contrast to your napkin color so it really “pops”. Print colors are available in Matte and Metallic. Let me know if you need help choosing a print color. 
 
4) Text to be printed – Choose your own wording! You can choose up to 3 lines of type, 24 maximum characters per line including spaces.  Please be sure and double check spelling and punctuation.

*IMPORTANT - This mold is best used for a casting mold with candy melt, chocolate or any liquid. The button holes are all the way through the button. 
To use as fondant button mold it works best to cut the little nubs off the mold and use a toothpick to make the holes in the buttons.
All of my molds are poured with a silicone that works wonderfully with polymer clays, resin, plaster, wax, soap, paper cast, low temperature metal alloys. Your embellishment will pop out easily, no need for mold release. The molds can be baked with the clay in them up to a temperature of 395 degrees.
This mold is made using a FDA Approved Food Grade Silicone.

And remember the only place these designs are available is with Mold Me Shape Me.
All molds are copyrighted by Melissa Roten. Meaning you may make items from them for sale or personal use, however you may not reproduce the mold
To insure your mold is of the highest quality I use a vacuum system to remove any air from my molds. My 25 years of sculpting originals for silicone molds assures that the mold you purchase will yield perfect castings. Using only the finest American made silicone your molds will last for years.

 I would be happy to work on a custom bracelet for you if you have a Personal Morse Code Message that you want for your bracelet, just let me know!
The thread is pure silk and many different colors are available, just pick the one you like as you check out.
SIZE :
This bracelet is made to order. The bracelet is adjustable on length and I still set different sizes for your best fit. If you are not sure what size is good as a gift for someone you love, choose the bigger size and just slide the bead down to the best fit. You may trim the thread and knot the ends if necessary.

Care Instructions:
Although our jewelry are high quality with extra layers of coat for long lasting, yet plated jewelry should be cleaned periodically. To extend the life of your jewelry, it’s very important that you keep it dry (never bathe or spray perfume on your jewelry, chemical reactions with chlorine and other elements such as perspiration can lead to tarnishing). Remove jewelry when sleeping, exercising, or doing physical activities, as prolonged contact with sweat will cause the plating to wear away faster. Never use abrasives chemicals or products to clean your jewelry. After each wear, gently wipe each piece of jewelry clean of make up and skin oils with a soft, lint-free cloth in order to avoid scratching. Since rose gold pieces are more sensitive because of copper usage (in order to turn the color from gold to rose gold), please care as instructed above.        ",17.00,4.8017,"Handmade item

This shirt fits true to size. Please see last picture for size chart. If you are unsure what size to order we recommend grabbing a shirt that currently fits well and measuring the width (armpit to armpit) and length (top of shoulder to bottom hem) and then comparing to the size chart. If you have questions on size please message us prior ordering 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Material   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We know your kids don't like itchy, scratchy fabrics and parents don't like clothes that shrink or fade after washing which is why we personally tested every toddler brand out there and found a shirt that is soft and looks great wash after wash with only minimal shrinking after washing and drying the first time. We recommend washing and drying shirt inside out for best results and please, no iron.
