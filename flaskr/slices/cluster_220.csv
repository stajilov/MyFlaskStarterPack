14882,"Miniature Mushrooms Pincushion, Mushroom Pin Cushion, Sewing Accessories, Woodland Scene, Sewing Table Decor, Crafty Mom Gift, Made To Order","
            *Made to order* Please note - the current creation time for this piece is 2 to 3 weeks. These are handmade one at a time; the one pictured has gone to a new home, but I will create a brand new one just for you that will be similar :)
This is my version of brown fawn mushrooms; I added deep lines to the caps for extra texture. One mushroom has just recently sprouted, while the other is taller and more flared at the bottom of its cap.
Made with a combination of wet-felted and needle felted wool, the mushroom caps are a  heather brown color and they have white stems. They grow from a mossy mound that is made with custom-mixed wool in a shade of light yellowish-green. Tiny thread grasses and buds in tan, brown and maroon are growing beside the mushrooms.
This sculpture is securely attached to a wooden disc on the bottom that I've painted olive green.
Place this miniature scene anywhere you like... use it as a pincushion or as a sweet little home decor or office desk item.
The entire piece is a little over 3 inches wide and about 4 inches tall.
You can see the rest of my nature-themed pincushions here:

19291,Handmade children's kitten slippers made from merino wool,"
            These adorable felted wool kitten slippers are handmade in Nepal. They will keep little feet warm, comfortable, and cozy. The cute tails allow children to put the slippers on by themselves. Suede soles prevent slipping.
Our wool slippers are made from 100% merino wool from New Zealand. The wool is hand dyed in Nepal using low impact dye (Azo-free and metal-free dyes), making it safe for even the most sensitive skin. All slippers are handmade by using soap and water. 
Caring for the slippers
If the slippers get dirty, try spot cleaning first. Use a sponge with lukewarm water and natural soap to remove the stain, then pat dry. If you need to wash the entire slipper, it is best to hand wash them. Always use lukewarm water. Squeeze water after washing, shape the slippers and place them to dry in a room (or outside in the shade). Over time, wool balls may form from daily wear. In that case, use a scissor to trim the wool balls rather than pulling them off. 
Benefits of our slippers
- Wool slippers keep your feet warm during cold months, while keeping them cool during warm months. 
- Wool slippers massage your feet. For tired feet after wearing shoes all day, wool felt slippers will provide soft comfort and relaxation to your feet. 
- Wool slippers are breathable. They are warm, but they produce dry-heat, preventing your feet from sweating or smelling.
- All mos pink slippers use suede soles to protect from slipping on hard wood floors.

            Old fashioned roses in shades of burgundy red and dusty rose with a sprinkling of powder blue posies are arranged on the moss green backdrop of this handmade ruffled girl's twirl skirt. It is suitable for special occasions, comfortable and durable for every day play. Best of all, it's many gathers make it full and delightfully twirly... a perfect gift for your little twirling girl!  
Beautifully handmade of fine quality preshrunk 100% cotton fabric, this skirt has a non-roll elastic waistband with plenty of stretch to insure a perfect and comfortable fit. It falls at or just below the knee and is designed to be worn shorter as your child grows. Machine wash & dry.

Skirt lengths are listed below. The elastic measures a bit less than children’s average waist measurements per size (so the skirt will stay up) with a minimum of 10"" of stretch to fit comfortably for years to come! For a custom fit include your child's waist measurement (taken accurately over bare waist) in notes to seller at checkout. I will adjust elastic to hold.
