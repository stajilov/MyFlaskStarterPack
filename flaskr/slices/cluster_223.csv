3377,Donmore Green Gold striped knit long-sleeved top,"
            This was my older brother's shirt.  I don't remember him wearing it, but it is definitely from the 70s. A groovy green and white pattern with green and gold strips.  Ribbed neck and sleeves.  It's perfect for the cool kid with a retro style.  
No tag to identify the material, but it is soft and there is a texture to the fabric that creates the pattern.  
Colors are green, white and gold.  
No stains or marks.  
No repairs.
One pen sized hole on the neck ribbing (see pic) and a tiny pull that you have to look for.
Kept its shape and colors over the years.

4056,"Eyeglass Case, Tapestry Eyeglass Case, Vintage Reading Glasses Case, Gift for Her, Magnifying Glasses Case, Grandma Chic, Case for Glasses,","
            This is a lovely floral design tapestry eyeglass case.  It is a slender design so I believe it would work best for what I call cheater glasses (the magnifying kind ) that are a little slimmer.  It is marked on the inside with a name that looks like Leo Gordon with an address in Westbury New York.  It is in very good condition and suitable for gifting. 
Lovely gift for mom or grandma or someone that likes the grandma chic style!

10713,Vintage Disney Aladdin and the King of Thieves VHS,"
            Relive the 90,s with the least terrible of Disney Television animation's direct to video releases of Aladdin. Robin Williams returns as the Genie.  So there's that.  The tape comes in its original clam-shell packaging which has been slightly crushed on one corner.  I have not tested this tape as I do not have a VHS player.
As with all items at Momma Bunny's Home for Wayward Children, this is a vintage item and will show signs of use and wear unless otherwise noted.  Please look closely at the pictures and ASK if you have any questions.  Because these items are acquired at yard sales, estate sales, and other places, I do not know the history of most of the items so I do not know if they came from a pet or smoke free environment unless otherwise noted.  These are used, vintage items.  Please do not expect a new item unless the description clearly states so.  Thank you  so much for stopping by to see the Wayward Children!!
