            Lovely pair of vintage metal shoe trees, aluminium shoe stretchers, shoe shapers, shoe inserts, shoe form, shoe lasts.
These are adjustable shoe trees so as to fit different sizes although they do both have the number 78 engraved into the aluminium.
As they are adjustable the length varies however the main part of the metal shoe insert is 13cm in length. there is then the adjustable section and the heel part is 6.5cm long.
Great decorative or display item for the home or for use as props.
There are signs of wear and tear in keeping with an item of this age all visible in the photos. In addition one of the adjusters is broken so not practical for everyday use however this doesn't take away from the aesthetic appeal.
Great collectible items which are a high quality lasting design.

18802,Men Leather Sandals - Men Gladiator Sandal in Light Brown Color,"
            Greetings visitors, 
Leatherhood Sandals are handmade sandals by local skilled craftsmen using traditional techniques that have existed for centuries. The source of our leather hides are tanneries located in the beautiful island of ''Crete''. Every hide is hand-picked and has its own unique features and marks that add character and beauty to the product that is created.
Leather is an ever changing and organic product. This is why the genuine leather we use for all of our items may present small colour variations and particularities that give a unique result to our handcrafted leather sandals. The chemical free, natural tan leather ages beautifully with time and wear.
Natural leather may vary from light beige to light brown and depends on the particular hide. Moreover it gets darker with use and when exposed to sunlight for a long period of time giving a fantastic colour result.
We believe in creating products with an honest approach and practical design and that there should be a simple everyday pair of sandals for everyone. All functions and leathers are considered to create a lasting life for our products. All of our products are handmade in Greece.
We hope that whichever piece you purchase accompany you for a long time and that our creations will help you along your path.
