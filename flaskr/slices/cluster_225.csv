2694,Moldavite Faceted Checkered Cut Rondelle Bead | 1 bead | 5X2MM| Priced Per Bead | Meteorite | Tektite | Beautiful Green Moldavite Czech |M4,"
            Beautiful and rare faceted checkered cut rondelle moldavite beads.
Size: approx 5mmX2MM each.
Price is PER Bead but more can be purchased via the drop down menu.  
All of my Moldavite is genuine from the Czech. I use the same source and guarantee the authenticity.
These Moldavite beads from the Czech Republic were purchased from a member of the International Meteorite Collectors Association. Each bead is hand cut, shaped and polished. 
These Moldavites are found in an area of Europe called the Central European Strewn Field. Moldavites are mostly found in Bohemia and Moravia in the Czech Republic. Some moldavites have been found in Germany and Austria. Moldavite types found include Muong Nong type, splash form, and irregular.
Moldavites contain more silica than any other type of tektite which produces their green color. Bohemian moldavite types have a greater SiO2 content than the Moravian moldavite types. Bohemian moldavites are mostly variations of green from pale to a rich bottle green color.
 
Moldavites are stunning rich green impact glasses created by the heat and pressure of an ancient meteorite impact. They are found in a very few areas which gives these captivating impactites their name. Some experts believe that moldavites are associated with an impact crater event. If that is correct it would make them approximately 15 million years old. While most impact specialists believe moldavites were created from melted terrestrial matter, they do display some characteristics associated with Meteorites.   
Moldavite accelerates one's spiritual path. It is known to clear blockages, awaken the intelligence of the heart, disconnects one from unhealthy attachments, makes dreams more vivid and meaningful and acts as a spiritual catalyst.
Other sized beads available including;
4.5X1MM

            Custom gift bags are great for every occasion, from wedding gifts, to birthdays, Christmas, and everything in between. I write on each bag by hand, making each and every bag custom and special. :) Please note that due to the handwritten nature, some tiny flecks of ink may be visible on some bags, but they will not be noticeable enough to distract from the design on the bags.
Please be sure to order the quantity you need for each size before adding to your cart to save yourself some time. :) For orders over 10, please contact me prior to purchase for discount information and so we can discuss the time frame you can expect for a larger order. 
Bags are made of sturdy craft paper. They are sturdy, however, I would not recommend putting more than 5 lbs of gifts in each bag. Other sizes may be available. Please contact me for information regarding those colors, sizes, and pricing. 
Ink colors are black, gold, silver, or rose gold. White can also be used but tends to be absorbed by the bag, losing it's vibrancy.
Once you select the quantity, bag and ink color, and click add to cart, you will see a box labeled ""Note to ArtofWordsBoutique"" where you can include what you would like on the bags if you want a different phrase. One popular customization is to request that one just says ""bride"" at the top, with tribe left off! Please also let me know if you would like to see the bags and approve them before I ship them. You will have 24 hours to approve them once I send the pictures. Once I receive your order, I will let you know when you can expect to see the pictures or when your bags will be ready to ship.. Current production time can be found under Shipping & Policies.
Standard shipping includes Priority 2-4 day shipping within the US, tracking, and order insurance.
International customers, please contact me for a quote for shipping based on your order volume.

14088,White Chalk Pencil for chalkboards - White Chalk Alternative- Artist supplies - Wedding Chalkboard- Kitchen Chalkboard,"
            This listing is for (1) white chalk pencil for use on our wedding chalkboards, kitchen chalkboards etc.
We use General's® Charcoal White® Drawing Pencils.
Handcrafted with responsibly harvested, sustained yield incense cedar wood to ensure smooth sharpening and strength. Handcrafted in New Jersey, USA since 1889.
Our chalkboards have been designed to fit this pencil, see our current selection here: 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/rusticcraftdesign?section_id=12705329
We include (1) pencil with all our chalkboards.
It should be noted that the chalk line is more thin than a standard white chalk stick, allowing for more detail but also being a little less easy to wipe off with a standard chalkboard eraser. We suggest wiping off/cleaning with a little water and a clean rag/towel. =)
*To purchase additional quantities, change the quantity after adding to cart.
Tips for using the chalk pencil on chalkboards:
○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○
1. Using the chalk pencil on an angle instead of straight on works for the best detail and control.
2. Ensuring the chalkboard is well seasoned with standard stick chalk helps to maintain the boards longevity, and also to help with use of the chalk pencil with the chalkboard.
3. The chalk pencil can be sharpened with a standard pencil sharpener
4. To erase your chalk board, a damp rag/towel should be used....and if the chalk is left on for a while, maybe a little Simple Green® cleaner with water and a damp rag. I have also heard from customers that a Mr. Clean® Magic Eraser® works great. 
5. Ensure to re-season your chalkboard often after cleaning =)
