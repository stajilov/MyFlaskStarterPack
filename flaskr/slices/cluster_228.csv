9033,1 oz - Royally Flawless Facial Oil  Face Moisturizer plus RECIPE,"
            The Royally Flawless facial oil moisturizer is THE facial oil I use every single night after cleansing. It's luxurious, decadent, gentle, and easily absorbed into the skin, so you don't feel slimy after applying it.
It's perfect for any skin type, as it nourishes, lightly moisturizes, and contains ingredients like argan oil, rosehip seed oil, frankincense oil, and Roman chamomile essential oil, all of which caress your skin into supple, clear, touchable beauty.
This listing is for the large 1-oz container, but you can start out with a 1/2 oz size instead - check the other listing! The 1-oz bottle comes with a removable glass dropper type lid.
Facial oil is an outstanding alternative to (or, if I may, better choice than) traditional emulsified moisturizers, as there are no extra synthetic ingredients needed. It sinks into your skin and nourishes from the outside in. As a result, you may find yourself with a radiant, soft face you'd never thought possible before.
INCLUDED WITH YOUR ORDER: The exact recipe I used to create this decadent, nourishing blend. (You receive the recipe with everything you order on Crunchy Betty's Natural Market, so you can make the exact same thing at home, later, if you really, really want to!) 
INGREDIENTS: Argan oil, jojoba oil, apricot kernel oil, sea buckthorn oil, rosehip seed oil, frankincense essential oil, chamomile essential oil, palma rosa essential oil, rose geranium essential oil, carrot seed oil, vitamin E
--
TO USE: Use this oil on a recently cleaned face (using cleansing grains, honey, oil cleansing method, or your favorite facial cleanser). Pour four to five drops into the palm of your hand, and rub it gently over your face, massaging it in lightly for a minute or two. Use on your face AND neck (never forget your neck!).
Use at least once a day, preferably at night.
--
Again, this is for the 1-oz listing of Royally Flawless Facial Oil by Crunchy Betty, hand blended and shipped within 2-7 business days of ordering.
--
And, as always, please visit www.crunchybetty.com for tons of natural beauty recipes, to learn more about the ingredients used in this facial oil, and for a huge barrel o' messy, messy laughs. 
--
Please note: None of the statements in this listing have been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Know your skin, know your ingredients, and don't use anything you don't feel personally comfortable with. It's fun to learn about natural beauty treatments, and it's even more fun to know what your skin loves - read, read, read all you can. And experiment even more! Knowledge is power, my friends.

10742,Leather Guitar Strap - Custom Guitar Strap - Handmade Guitar Strap - Personalized Rugged Guitar - Acoustic Guitar - Electric Guitar - JPDco,"
            This handmade leather guitar strap is cut from rugged bridle leather. The two-piece folk design has keyholes notched into both ends for a wide adjustment range. The main strip is 1"" thick, and It has a removable shoulder pad for added comfort. This strap is compatible with most electric and acoustic guitars - shown above in russet, and accented with a solid line trim.
------------------------------------------------------------
These handmade leather straps are individually cut, shaped, and assembled in my Toronto studio using English bridle leather from the legendary Wickett&Craig tannery. The leather has been hand-selected for its strength and natural character; range markings, folds, and scars give each hide its own unique charm. Everything in the JPDco lineup is assembled using the highest grade materials: solid brass hardware, Riri zipper assemblies, and of course, heirloom quality bridle leather. For added comfort and durability, all edges are beveled and smoothed in a process called burnishing. Each piece is then conditioned with a rubbed-in blend of natural oils and waxes, before finally being shipped to your door. With regular use, and exposure to everyday life, the leather will darken and earn a rich patina - one which makes it uniquely yours. 
------------------------------------------------------------
DESIGN:
---Color Options---
Every hide is different, so each piece will ultimately have it's own unique signature. The color examples shown above were photographed under natural light, and they're a good representation of how the leather looks in person. With regular use, and exposure to dirt and everyday life, the leather will darken and earn a rich patina.
---Optional Trim---
Four patterns are shown in the example photo above. To add a trim to your strap, include a note with your selection at check-out. Natural, without trim is the assumed standard.
---Size---
The standard adjustable length is 115cm - 135cm, but a custom fit is always better, so feel free to ask about size options.
---Custom Embossing---
This piece can be personalized with a custom monogrammed message: names, initials, poetry, etc... The letters shown above are 10mm in height, and the same font is also available in 5mm. The text will be positioned as shown in the example photo, but different layouts or extra lines may sometimes be necessary. For example, an alternative layout may be more appropriate for longer messages, and a basic 3mm font may be used instead. For lengthwise text layouts, please specify the player's handedness - right-handed will be assumed as the default. Unless specific design instructions have been provided, I'll rely on my best judgement to make your personalized text look great. Feel free to get in touch and make suggestions, let's talk about your new custom piece! To order embossing: add to cart, and leave your design details at check-out.
---Loop-End Upgrade---
This strap can also be made with a built-in loop end instead of the traditional keyhole - great for instruments without a secondary strap pin, like vintage guitars, classical guitars, some acoustics, etc.. Purchase the add-on right here:

            Beach decor sea glass.  Nautical decor beach glass by the pound in a **2 pound** order. Perfect for beach wedding table decor, beach decorating, mixed in a crystal bowl, or added to a display of seashells.  Easy coastal cottage charm!
My sea glass (or beach glass)  is available in many fabulous colors or I can create a custom mix for you of any of my available colors.
Sea Glass colors are listed in the drop down menu in the order shown on the sample photo.   
My sea glass is actually man made recycled glass, not genuine sea glass. I'd love to use real but it's just too rare and expensive!  I get a lot of customers, though, who say they prefer the brighter colors and bigger assortment I can offer with man made recycled glass.
For a sense of scale, 2 pounds fits perfectly into a common white Chinese take-out container.  
Size of sea glass pieces will range from around 1/2"" up to about 2.5"" and everywhere in between.  It will be a nice mix of sizes and shapes.  Sorry, I cannot ""sort"" specific sizes!  
***Please note relative size and shapes of each color as they do come from different manufacturers and have different properties.   All are flat except Turquoise which is larger and chunkier.    Each shipment of sea glass varies slightly in color as well, so expect small variations from the photos. 
STYLE #SGB100
If you choose ""Custom Mix"" please let me know your color choices in the ""message to seller"". 
I will mix the colors equally unless you specify otherwise. 
                                                          
NOTE***** You are buying ****2 pounds**** of sea glass in it, NOT 1 POUND!  
Compare ""apples to apples"" pricing--1 pound of sea glass isn't very much-- a little bigger than your fist!!  
My 2 pound portion fits in a typical white Chinese take-out container.

FRESHWATER PEARL
Form in various species of freshwater mussels, family Unionidae, which live in lakes, rivers, ponds and other bodies of fresh water. These freshwater pearl mussels occur not only in hotter climates but also in colder more temperate areas such as Scotland (where they are protected under law).
SWAROVSKI CRYSTAL PEARLS
The pearls used in the Swarovski Fashion Jewelry collection are simulated pearls and are not natural. Crystal Pearls by Swarovski are pearls made with a crystal core. Their unparalleled harmonious and lustrous shimmer is achieved using a unique coating technology developed by Swarovski. It is the first production method in the world to combine the quality of a perfect crystal core with the exquisite beauty of a pearl coating. The innovative technology by Swarovski gives the pearl a mysterious glow, which appears to be radiating from within the pearl itself. The strictest quality controls help ensure the absolute flawlessness of each Crystal Pearl.

            Mother's Day, mix and match two tone, silver and gold, double circle earrings...
These double circle earrings are cute and perfect for a night out, and just as perfect for everyday. 
Simple and beautiful, the circle is thin and round on one side and more full and flat on the other which creates just a little bit of playfulness, a little bit of difference to catch the eye.
Perfect. Simple yet rich. These earrings come in a variety of combinations of both sizes, and material - order a pair in all silver, all 24K gold plate over sterling silver, or mix the two for the perfect pair of two-tone earrings. 
The ear wires will be in either sterling silver or gold filled, depending on which earring you order. Silver circles are solid sterling silver, gold circles are 24K gold plate over solid sterling silver.
Check below for the different options and sizes.
Your item comes wonderfully boxed and wrapped so you can give it as a gift - or enjoy opening it as a gift yourself!
