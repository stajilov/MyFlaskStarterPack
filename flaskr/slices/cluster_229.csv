6756,Foxtail Barley Ornamental Grass Seeds (Hordeum jubatum) 50Seeds,"
            Foxtail Barley (Hordeum jubatum) - If you like native ornamental grasses, try growing Foxtail Barley grass seeds. It is also commonly called Squirrel Tail Grass, and it prefers full sun and moist to dry conditions. In the wild, Hordeum jubatum Foxtail Barley can be found growing along the edges of marshes, poorly drained fields, pastures, and gravelly areas along roads and railroads. It even tolerates salt, but it cannot compete well with taller vegetation. Hordeum jubatum has gained popularity as an ornamental grass because of its highly attractive flower heads.
How To Grow Foxtail Barley Seeds: The ornamental grass seeds can be started directly outdoors in spring once frost danger has passed. Prepare a weed free seedbed. Foxtail Barley is known to self-sow easily, but it is shallow-rooted making unwanted seedlings easy to pull and remove.
 Season: Perennial
USDA Zones: 4 - 10
Height: 20 inches
Foliage Color: Green
Flower Color: White to pink
Soil Requirement: Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions
Environment: Full sun to partial shade

**You can expect that when the paste is removed from the skin, the stain will be a light orange; however, the color will deepen as the pigments are absorbed into the skin. Within 24-48 hours of the removal of the paste, the stain will develop into a rich, dark reddish-brown. The stain will last approximately 1 to 2 weeks, depending on after-care. Naturally, there are variables that will either help develop and maintain the desired results, or prevent effective staining. For best results, paste should be applied to clean skin that is free of lotions or oils. Although the henna is 100% natural and free of harmful chemicals, there are extremely rare instances of allergic reaction to the essential oils. Apply a small amount for a patch-test prior to drawing your design.
**Henna paste can expire if not stored properly. Heat releases the dye content; therefore, henna paste should be stored in the freezer until 30 minutes before use. Henna paste will retain freshness for up to 1 year if stored in the freezer.
The natural henna is a little-known brand that is grown on my friend's family farm and imported from India, which is known to be one of the best regions for henna production. It is a superior quality natural, henna hand-mixed with lemon juice and 100% aromatherapy grade pure essential lavender and eucalyptus oils and tends to produce a consistently dark stain. The henna is filled into this convenient bottle for easy, ready-to-use application. CHEMICAL-FREE.        ",2.99,4.5634,"Handmade item

Choose from bottom ring sizes  8"", 9"", 10"", or 11"". 
Please specify the sizes of rings and tops that you need. You do not receive a pair of tops and bottoms. You must specify what you need (washer tops or bottom rings) in the drop down list of sizes.

16133,"English Lavender Seed, Lavandula angustifolia Seeds, Fragrant Flower Garden, Grow Your Own Fresh Lavender","
            English Lavender, Lavandula angustifolia, is one of the best lavenders for dried flower heads. The plants will form a bushy mound approx. 12- 14 inches tall. The plants are covered in beautiful spires of fragrant purple lavender blooms. It is a great plant to bring much needed pollinators to the garden. The bees love it! Hardy in zones 5-7. Each packet contains 25 seeds. 
Lavender grows best in full sun and VERY well drained soil.  If seeds are started early indoors you may get sporadic blooms the first year. All seeds come with complete growing instructions. 
Also available as a kit

18149,Fake Septum Ring - faux septum ring - septum ring - septum cuff - clip on septum ring - septum,"
            These fake piercings are ideal for younger individuals who may still be living under their parents’ roof (and whose parents love the idea of letting them try out something new without a commitment) and those who want the flexibility of a professional daytime appearance and a fun night time look. These colored nose rings are also a great way to try out the look of a piercing before you commit, and in some cases clients have told me they were happy they went this route first because they decided they didn’t want the real deal! 
The purchase of this listing is for one (1) clip on piercing. The size shown in the picture is 6mm wide and made with 20G wire.
Available in fifteen custom colors, these faux nose rings are handcrafted with silver plated copper. Please refer to picture three for colors, and use the drop down menu to the right of this description when making your purchase to select your preferred colored nose ring. 
When you slip one of our fake nose rings on you will be instantly transformed into a punk goddess, a rebel without a cause, a diva of the dance floor! You will be transformed into a lady with edge without having to undergo a piercing gun! 
These clip on nose rings allow you the ability to sport a little extra metal in your head without the commitment to a permanent piercing. Each of these custom nose rings are adjustable making them one size fits all.
