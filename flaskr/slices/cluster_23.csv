            ""This Must Be The Place"" Who doesn't love a Talking Heads classic??
This is a quote taken from The Talking Heads song (Naive Melody) and not a quote by Josie B
IMPORTANT! Please, do not get the mats WET. This is a handmade, hand painted item and it must be treated that way. Places with heavy foot traffic, wiping your feet on the letters, direct constant sunlight, and stormy weather are all things that can make it fade quicker. The ideal place for your hand painted mat is in a dry covered area. 
Currently mats take about 4 weeks to be made and shipped. Please message me if you have any questions about this.
18"" x 30"" rectangular Coir and Vinyl door mat for outdoor use. The mat is 9/16 of an inch thick. All mats are rolled up tight for the most cost effective way to ship. When your package arrives, unwrap the mat and lay flat so it can settle back to its original shape. 
All doormats are hand painted with special outdoor paint that cannot be found in your local craft store. This is industrial grade paint that is made for outdoor use and will not fade quickly like spray paint or acrylic paint would.  Please keep in mind this is a hand painted item and made to order, therefore processing time is currently about 4 weeks. All mats are shipped through USPS and a tracking number is provided.
Disclaimer:
Josie B is not responsible for lost or stolen packages. Once the item is shipped, Josie B has no control over the USPS deliveries. YOU MUST enter your correct shipping address when you purchase your item. If not and the mat is shipped to the wrong address, or if it is returned to me due to insufficient address, the shipping can not be refunded and Josie B will not pay to have it reshipped. Please inquire if you have any questions regarding this.

11293,Ladies Claddagh Ring,"
            This is a claddagh ring made in sold sterling silver, solid 10k gold, solid 14k gold, solid 18k gold or Platinum.  This ring is a traditional Irish ring with many myths and legends surrounding it.  One of the best known is that the first ring was made by a young man from Galway, Ireland who was captured by Corsican pirate and spent many years enslaved in the Middle East.  While a slave he learned gold smithing.  When the Irish king negeotiated for the release of the slaves, he returned to Galway and married the girl who had waited all the years for him.  He made her a claddagh for a wedding ring with hands to symbolize friendship, a crown to symbolize loyalty and fidelity and a heart to symbolize eternal love.  
According to Irish author Colin Murphy, the way in which a Claddagh ring was worn with the intention of conveying the wearer's relationship status:
On the right hand with the point of the heart toward the fingertips, the wearer is single and may be looking for love. (This is most commonly the case when a young woman has first received the ring from a relative, unless she is already engaged.)
On the right hand with the point of the heart toward the wrist, the wearer is in a relationship.
On the left hand with the point of the heart toward the fingertips, the wearer is engaged.
On the left hand with the point of the heart toward the wrist, the wearer is married.
While puzzle rings are our specialty, we offer a wide range of non-puzzle rings in a variety of motifs. We carry rings for animal lovers, motorcycle enthusiasts, horse aficionados, and many other styles and interests. They are heavy, solid rings.
We make over 100 designs of puzzle rings, gimmal rings, féde rings, chain rings and wedding puzzle rings drawing from the traditions of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Persia, and Europe, and our own modern variations. 
Each ring is handcrafted in our workshop in middle Tennessee, drawing on our own family tradition which is nearing its 70th anniversary. Tacey makes all items by hand with some help from part-time employees.
