3871,Great Lakes Map 1938,"
            This is a beautiful, high quality print of the NOAA historical chart of the Great Lakes from 1938. 
We take great care to ensure that the best materials, packaging and service are part of every order.
 
OUR PRINTING PROCESS (printers, inks & paper)
Our nautical charts and maps are printed on high-end professional equipment using art-quality archival inks and paper.  
 
The paper used for 18âx18â prints and larger is an acid-free 32lb bond with a smooth matte, non-glare finish. Prints 13âx19â and smaller are printed on sturdy acid-free card stock with a matte finish.
 
The inks used in the process are professional grade to provide rich and authentic color and are acid-free to ensure that the prints will not fade over time.
 
The size of each print refers to the actual size of the paper on which they are printed, leaving a .25â white boarder around the image.  The prints fit nicely inside standard sized frames of the same dimension. 
 
DIGITAL RESTORATION
All maps are meticulously digitally restored to provide you with a clean, clear and beautiful map that honors its period of origin.  
 
In this process imperfections are removed.  (Including:  creases, smudges, tears, discoloration caused by age, non-original stamps, etc.)  The result is a gorgeous map reproduction true to its historical vintage.
 
PACKAGING AND SHIPPING
All prints are well packaged in sturdy tubes or envelopes to offer guaranteed protection.
 
Prints sized 13âx19â or smaller ship flat inside a sturdy cardboard shipping envelope with a cardboard insert for added reinforcement.  Each print is sealed inside a clear poly sleeve for protection and presentation.
 
Prints sized 18âx24â or larger ship loosely rolled in a sturdy shipping tube.  Each print is inside a plastic sleeve to add protection during shipping and in removing the print.
 
We fulfill all orders quickly and your print will arrive safely or we will replace it.

Lettering with an actual brush & watercolors is hands down my favorite form of Hand-Lettering! Which is why I am so excited to share with all of you my Watercolor Brush Lettering Practice Sheets and Drills Pack! This set is for the lowercase alphabet only and it features my own (modern-calligraphy) lettering style as seen on my Instagram account @HoneyBopsDesigns. I will also be lettering the whole a to z alphabet there through real-time videos, so make sure to follow me!
Did you know that Lettering is also considered a form of illustration? This is why it is an artistic expression and a truly enjoyable one! With Watercolor Brush Lettering you can be as creative as you'd like!
NOTE: This pack includes only the LOWER-CASE ALPHABET. For best results, print your PDF at 100% on letter size paper.
These practice sheets are designed to help you gain control of your brush until you fall in love with it and it loves you enough to do everything you want it to do!
This style is so fun that I use it almost every day! I have stopped buying store-bought cards, and lettering them myself!
The final finished pieces are also fun to hang as nursery decor, children's room decor, office inspirationals, and home decor...the possibilities are endless!
THIS pack includes a total of 50 pages as follows:
- Practice Drills - 12 pages!
These drills are designed with some of the basic strokes required to form each lowercase letter and help you loosen up and develop the fine motor control skills for creating confident strokes.

by Frankie & Myrrh --  50 Post St, San Francisco, California      frankieandmyrrh.com
I'm a bitch sometimes during PMS.  This spray was created with those times in mind and with some of my favorite oils.
To help with PMS, hot flashes, menopausal issues, and overall general bitchiness, we use the two oils considered to be the best for those issues:  Rose Geranium and Clary Sage.  Then we add Lavender, Bergamot, and Frankincense, which all have a calming effect.
The spray has a wonderful, well rounded floral scent with the smell of Rose Geranium being the most prominent.  Bergamot and Lavender provide the light refreshing top notes to start the scent. Clary Sage provides a strengthening woody, herbal note to the middle of the scent.  The classic smell of Rose Geranium carries the scent through the middle and pleasantly lingers until Frankincense adds the needed depth at the end.
Spray the Bitch Away is a light freshwater perfume with a purpose. Always breathe in the aroma as you are using it.  I use it as a deodorant spray under clothing and as a body mist after a shower.  With a spritz or two it really helps freshen you up without being overpowering like synthetic perfumes/body sprays. Works great as a room freshener, car freshener, or linen spray.  Carry in your purse as a hand-sanitizer.  Even helps to repel insects.  Spray near co-workers, friends, and relatives as needed.  Spray it into the air and let them soak it in.
Recent Etsy Customer Reviews of Spray the Bitch Away:
""Awesome product! Don't change a thing. thanks""
""My mom got a good laugh and loved it too""

""I am very happy with this purchase - fast shipping, good packaging and very good item quality""
****For best aromatherapy results:  Spray several times into cupped hands, place hands over nose and mouth, close your eyes, then inhale deeply only through your nose for 60 seconds or more.  Repeat, if you are feeling particularly bitchy.

8978,DIY Bubbly Bath Bar / Solid Bubble Bath Recipe- FOOLPROOF!,"
            VIDEOS: 
YouTube video of me rolling my Unicorn Poop Bubbly Bath Bar Log: http://youtu.be/PaZ50IL6lUk
Royalty Soaps YouTube video featuring this recipe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIF-E76Qw2I
You've wasted enough expensive ingredients making substandard solid bubble bath bars with problematic recipes, right? You've dropped enough dough on overpriced retail bars that stain the tub & dry your skin too. No more!
Through much trial and error, I have come to Holy Grail of solid bubble bath recipes. It is The Ultimate DIY Bubbly Bath Bar Recipe & it's foolproof! You can use my recipe to customize your own bars to sell in your shop, or just use at home, by changing the color & scent to your own preference. You can make these jelly roll style, make cookie cut outs, ice cream or cookie scoop bars, or be creative with silicone molds. This is a rollable, not a pipable recipe. (For a pipable bubble bath frosting recipe, see the DIY Bubble Bath Bomb Cupcake Tutorial & Guide in ""recipes"" in my store.)
This recipe is easy to make, it is infinitely customizable & it's very skin softening. The dough is soft long enough to be able to work it into the shapes you prefer, but it dries hard & is able to be shipped in just a few days. The inside stays soft enough to be able to break it off easily & crumble it in your tub, but the exterior is hard enough to survive shipping & even a bit of abuse without smashing. (I bubble wrap my finished bars like bath bombs & I ship all my products.)
Other recipes dry so fast you don't have time to be creative. You do not want to be rushed if you want a full range of shaping options. You also don't want the recipes that stay tacky forever & never fully dry. Solid bubble bath bars that are too soft will smash in shipping & won't survive handling in shops. These bars are the perfect consistency. You will have time to play with the dough, but you won't have to wait weeks (or forever) for them to dry. They take 2-3 days to dry on average. They also bubble like mad in the tub with a long lasting bubble. These are the Ultimate DIY Solid Bubbly Bath Bar!
In my PDF download you will get:
-Foolproof recipe & detailed instructions on how to create your own bars with alternate instructions for hot & humid climates
-Detailed instructions on how to create the dough & color & portion it for shaping
-2 methods to make the beautiful jelly roll design we all love
-Tons of color pictures of every single stage of the process from weighing to cutting 
-A list of merchants to purchase ingredients from economically 
-A picture gallery of my bars to inspire you with ideas to make your own unique bars
-10 jam packed pages for a complete solid bubble bath how-to guide
In just days, you can enjoy your creations in your own tub. 
The Ultimate DIY Bubbly Bath Bar recipe is the price of only 3 retail bars, on average. You will recoup the cost of this recipe making only one batch. Most people's first batch are beautiful the first time because this recipe is so easy to make.
INGREDIENTS you'll need to make these: 
Dry ingredients: baking soda, slsa, cream of tartar, tapioca OR cornstarch, mica or lake dyes
