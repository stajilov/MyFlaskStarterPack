875,Vintage 80s AB rhinestone earrings large but understated and elegant,"
            For those of you who remember to 1980s, everything was big (except our waistlines) especially jewelry, and shoulders. These earrings are bold studs in sparkling AB rhinestones that I wore often in my club kid days.  They could also be perfect for a bride looking to add a little flash.  They are icy AB crystal, but depending on the colors nearby, they reflect differently. For example, I'm wearing an orange dress. You can see the color in the glass.  I showed them on a dark background so you could see how they might reflect if you have dark hair or skin they aren't gold though, definitely silver AB. No chips, cracks or breaks to solid stone. 
Measurements: 3/4""
Thank you for looking. I am most grateful. Please check in often for new and interesting items. I should have a wide range of fun things in an equally wide range of prices.
