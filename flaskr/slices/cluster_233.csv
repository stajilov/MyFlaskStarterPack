11687,Three Days: Poetry Chapbook,"
            This chapbook features the single long poem Three Days, which I wrote as a memento mori for my mother. It was originally featured in the blog Tattoosday, as an April Poetry Month daily tribute to tattoed poets, 6 April 2012. It was then published again in the poetry zine Blue Heron Review in their summer 2014 issue--and nominated for the Pushcart Prize.
This is the first printed edition of the poem, which is this chapbook published by Murpheus.
 A slender edition of 18 pages, the cover photograph is by JBG--to whom the poem is dedicated.
An interesting note (to me) were the reactions of people to the poem during its previous incarnations: one, rather brusque and not overly cuddly, woman said it made her weep; a literatti poetry dude I hadn't met was impressed with the poem's technique; the poem got a bit of a cult following despite having no-'till-now print editions, or public readings yet.

12216,Wedding Tie Clip for Groom - Valentine’s Day Gifts - Tie Clip for Groom - January Birthstone Jewelry for Men - Custom Groomsmen Tie Clip,"
            The perfect piece of jewelry for men for that special occasion -  a tie clip in antiqued bronze tone, featuring a natural January birthstone Garnet adorned by a crashed Pyrite. This handcrafted accessory will be indispensable as a wedding tie clip for the groom,  as a custom groomsmen tie clip (they can be customized with another birthstone or combined with other stones) or a Valentine's Day gift for him. 
Garnet, a birthstone for the January-born people, is considered a regenerating stone, but also a stone of romantic love and passion. In the ancient times, Garnet was worn as a talisman to warn of danger and protect as well as bring success in business, because of its color that was believed to attract abundance and prosperity. Some believe that this beautiful gemstone can assist in energizing and balancing the physical body, improving productivity and stamina, and can even fight low self-esteem and depression. A stone of devotion, Garnet is said to help promote your inner aim, draw negativity away, inspire love and passion and enhance sensuality and sexuality. Garnet jewelry is a perfect friendship token, an ideal 2nd, 6th and 19th wedding anniversary gift, a January birthstone gift and a souvenir for those who are about to embark on a journey. Garnet is associated with the 1st chakra and is a gemstone of the Astrological sign of Capricorn and Leo. 
 
Pyrite, known as a stone that attracts good luck and good fortune, is also believed to assist in overcoming fatigue and increasing energy. This stone of intellect and protection is said to protect its wearer from harm and danger, improve mental stability, creativity and logic. Some other properties associated with Pyrite are protecting its wearer from harm and danger, blocking out negativity, and inspiring confidence and persistence. 
You can choose from these color options: antique bronze, black gunmetal, silver-plated or red copper .
Details: 
This listing is for one tie clip, props not included. You will receive an item made just for you from the same combination of stones, which will look similar to the piece shown in the photos above. 
The tie clip is brass base, lead and nickel free. 
Length: approximately 2.08 inch (5.3 cm)
Diameter of the stone tray: 0.63 inch (16 mm)
When opening be careful not to grip by the stones.
Please note that every raw stone is a natural formation, with its unique shape, color and structure and no two pieces are alike, which makes these pieces one-of-a-kind creations and your piece will be unique only to you. 
Natural gemstones and crystals are characterized by inherent flaws and imperfections, which are a great part of their beauty and charm.
Important: it is natural for some Pyrite grains and particles to shed off and is not considered a defect.
The item comes in a beautiful signature box, ready for gift giving.
The photos were taken in the natural light, without a flash.
