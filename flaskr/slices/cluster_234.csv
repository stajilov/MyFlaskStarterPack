7815,Tooth Fairy Pillow - Tooth Fairy Pillow for Girls,"
            I love these little tooth fairy pillows! They feature a girl tooth fairy along with a tiny pocket on the front just the right size for those tiny teeth or a treat from the tooth fairy. There's also a pocket on the back of the pillow for your child to leave a note to the tooth fairy, or the tooth fairy to leave a ""tooth receipt"". Each pillow is personalized with your child's name. The tooth fairy's skin tone, eye color and hair color can be customized. Please consult the last listing picture for a color chart for skin tone, hair and eye colors. 
The pink pillow is made of hot pink with white dots fabric. It features a fairy with iridescent wings bordered in purple, a lime green dress, and a lime green tooth pocket. Your child's name is embroidered in purple. It has a lime green hanging ribbon and bow.
The lavender pillow is made of lavender with white dots fabric. It features a fairy with iridescent wings bordered in light purple, a fairy with a hot pink dress and a hot pink tooth pocket. Your child's name is embroidered in hot pink. It has a hot pink hanging ribbon and bow.
The aqua pillow is made of tone/tone aqua striped seersucker fabric. It features a fairy with iridescent wings bordered in lavender, a fairy with a lavender dress and a lavender tooth pocket. Your child's name is embroidered in hot pink. It has a lavender hanging ribbon and bow.
The pillows measure approximately 4"" X 6"" and are made using high quality cotton and appliqued. Pillows are stuffed using polyester fiberfill. Each pillow has a coordinating ribbon attached so that your child can hang them on their bedpost or doorknob. No more waking up the child trying to find their tooth under their pillow! The girl version also has a bow attached to the handle.
***In a rush?***
I do a batch of tooth pillows every week (typically over the weekend) and they mail out the following Monday or Tuesday.  I have the processing time set to 2-3 weeks to allow for special circumstances, illnesses, out of stock materials…etc.  That being said, most of the time, pillows ship ahead of schedule, but is it not guaranteed to ship until the “ship by” date listed on your receipt.  If you are need your tooth pillow shipped sooner than the stated date, I would recommend one of two options:
1.	 Add a rush to your order.  I have various rush order options ranging from 1 business day to 10 business days at various price points.  Please keep in mind that the time does not include shipping time.  Shipping usually takes 2-5 days depending of your location relative to me (I’m in Oklahoma).  The rush order listing is found here: 
http://etsy.me/2jUTkpM
2.	I have a selection of my most popular pillows premade and ready for shipping the following business day.  These pillows are exactly like the made-to-order pillows EXCEPT that the name is put on using heat transfer vinyl, not embroidery.  My ready to ship pillows are all found here: 
http://etsy.me/2jUS06l
Please note that fabric choices for the applique or ribbon may vary according to availability and will be chosen to coordinate with the other thread/fabric colors. If you have a specific fabric/ribbon that you would like used in the applique, please contact me directly via the ""convo"" button.
Please review the store policies for care instructions and shipping information.

            Personalized Wedding Gift by Alphabet Art Photos
♥ ♥ ♥ ABOUT THE ARTIST ♥ ♥ ♥
I am a photographic artist out of North Carolina and take pictures of forms that resemble letters of the alphabet to create a personalized piece of artwork. I also offer numbers as you can see in this Est. Date Print.
I do my own printing, so as well as offering a quick turnaround time I ensure that each print passes my own high standards for quality and finish. Read more on the store 'about me' page; 
www.etsy.com/shop/AlphabetArtPhotos/about
♥ ♥ ♥ ABOUT THIS LISTING ♥ ♥ ♥
♥ This listing is for a framed, personalized DATE print on premium, archival photo paper. 
♥ In the first example picture (the color version) you can see my photo images 'Est.' followed by '8-22-15', which represents the date August 22nd, 2015 (a wedding date). I have also added text to personalize the design with the couple's names, and the wedding venue (City/State).
♥ So, a total of four images (Est. plus date), printed onto one piece of premium, archival, photo paper. The print size is 10x20 inches.
♥ I can print my date prints in color (the most popular), classic black & white, or a stylish sepia tone.
♥ Take a look at the fourth pic in this listing image slider for an idea of the style of number images you can expect in your design (I am always adding to my library so there is a nice variety and I have more than once choice for most of the numbers).
♥ You can include text to add personalized names, venue, quotes, references, sayings etc. This is a complimentary service that I do and it adds an extra personalized touch to the gift. It is optional...you could just get the border around the numbers without the text. If you do opt for the text just let me know via convo or in the 'notes to seller' section during checkout the details you want me to add, and in which position on the layout.
♥ Perfect for Weddings and Anniversaries, and of course a wonderful idea for Christmas! Create your own special keepsake that will be cherished for years to come...
♥ This listing is for the FRAMED print.
♥ I print everything onto one large print (the letters and the personalization), and this fits directly into a frame without matting.
♥ The print will be 10x20 inches.
♥ The color print and also the black & white print will come framed in a black frame. The sepia print will come in an espresso brown frame. Please specify if you want the other color frame with your print.
♥ Most of the pics in the listing image slider show the standard frame. I also offer a wider frame style which can be seen in the final pic in the image slider. This frame is 2.5 inches wide (double the width of the standard frame).
♥ ♥ ♥ HOW TO ORDER ♥ ♥ ♥
1) Select the number of prints you would like in your order using the ""Quantity"" drop down box (some people like to buy a few at a time, especially around Christmas, because I combine the shipping costs if all are going to the same mailing address).
2) Select the frame type you would like your date print to come in (standard or wider style).
3) Select the color of print you want (Color, Black & White, or Sepia Tone ~ refer to the listing images for a representation of these).
4) During the checkout process you will see an area called ""notes to seller"" and that is the spot to give me the particular details for your personalized date print (the date, and any personalization you want adding ~ like first names and city/state of wedding venue for example).
5) After ordering please keep an eye out for a message from me (etsy convo) with a proof attached. I will endeavor to supply your proof as soon as I can. The proofing process is your opportunity to make sure everything is looking how you want it and of course to check for spellings etc. Once approved, I can then move forward with your order and print it!
6) If you are new to Etsy please make sure that you have approved your account. Otherwise the messages between customer and seller do not make it through (and this can lead to frustration for both parties ~ especially if your order is time sensitive)

            Memorial Bridal Bouquet Charm, Walk with me today Dad, Bouquet Charm, Bridal Charm, Custom Photo, Wedding Charm
This is a lovely way to pay tribute to a loved one who cannot be there on your special wedding day. This is a carefully hand crafted custom photo memorial charm.
This design has the photo of your choice plus the quote ""Walk with me today Dad"". If you need the word changed from Dad to something else like, Mom, Grandpa, Grandma just let me know in the ""message to seller"" at check out time.
**This is NOT a DIY item, this does require that you send to me a photo. Either scan one and send or take a photo of one and send but please do NOT crop the photo for me it is easier for me to work with when sent uncropped.
The photo and quote are each 1"" in diameter and are in a silver plated bottle cap style charm. Images are sealed with an epoxy type dome cover (recommended not to get these wet). This is a very lightweight charm to attach to your wedding bouquet with ribbon. Please note I do not provide the ribbon as many brides like to color coordinate it with their wedding colors.
Once the listing is purchased, send your uncropped photo to  jcowie [!at] execulink.com or attach in an Etsy convo. You will receive back a proof that will require approval before this can be made. Your photo can be done in color, black and white or sepia tone.
I always highly recommend planning in advance of your event to avoid disappointment.
This will take approximately 7 days to create before it is shipped.

*******PLEASE ENTER DATE OF PARTY AT CHECKOUT!**********
Orders that come in without sizes or colors may be delayed. 
**Please read***
Please order early: Due to inventory costs, we do not carry a large quantity of each size in stock at all times. Depending on the sizes/quantities you are looking for, there may be a 2 week delay in shipment to allow time for re-printing. Please let us know when the date of your party is so we can be sure to accommodate your timeline.  
If ordering custom back printing: The custom lettering is done using heat transfer letters, similar to athletic jerseys. It is 100% washable, and super cute, but does look a bit different than the screened ink on the front of the shirts. Due to this process being done by hand, it can take an additional week or more to complete orders with custom text on the back.
Additionally, custom back printing is a final sale and is NOT eligible for an exchange or refund. 
Questions or concerns?: We know how challenging planning a bachelorette party can be! If you have any questions, please feel free to email us at info(at)bachette.com if you have any questions! 
WANT A CUSTOM PHRASE ON THE BACK?
No problem! Simply add this upgrade listing to your cart, one for every shirt you would like customized. Cost is 12/shirt and you have the choice of white, red, navy or black lettering. 
CUSTOM BACK UPGRADE: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/173290245/custom-back-printing
WANT T-SHIRTS?
We will do that! Cost is 25/shirt, and they have to be custom-ordered, which may take up to an additional two weeks. Please message us to set up a custom t-shirt listing.

============ TURQUOISE USES AND PURPOSES ============
Turquoise is perhaps the oldest stone in man’s history, the talisman of kings, shamans, and warriors. It is a stone of protection, strong and opaque, yet soothing to the touch, healing to the eye, as if carved from an azure heaven and slipped to earth. Its unique shade of blue, often blue-green, lends it name, Turquoise, to all things of this tranquil hue. The delicate veining or mottled webbing in cream or brown is inherent to the stone and serves to enhance its character.
For centuries Turquoise has been recognized as possessing the power to protect riders from injury due to falls. First used as amulets by Turkish soldiers, on their persons and attached to their bridles and trappings, it later came to be used for protection against falls of any kind. Turquoise howlite is also reputed to be influenced by the physical condition of the person who wears it. It is thought to grow pale when its owner is sick or sad, lose all color when the person dies, and gradually recover its color when transferred to a new healthy owner, its color deepening each day. 
Turquoise is a talisman of luck, success, ambition and creativity.
In the workplace, Turquoise promotes leadership, assists relocation or regular travel associated with career, and helps avoid unwise investments. It helps overcome writer’s block, and is a stone of clear communication when giving information; an especially good amulet for those who work in the law, or for local or central government. Turquoise is especially recommended for accountants and computer operators for mental relaxation, for those who work in radio or television to release anxiety, and for laborers to protect from bodily harm. 
As a crystal for travel, Turquoise protects you and your possessions against theft, loss or attack, helps prevent accidents, especially falls, and even guards your pet.
