828,Mid-Century Jewelry Modernist Necklace Earring Set Ed Levin Jewelry Sterling and 14k Gold Necklace & Earring Set Mother's Day Gifts For Her,"
            This Ed Levin necklace & earring set is a perfect example of his flawless and stunning sense of design. 
For the discerning collector of mid-20th century jewelry or a truely lovely gift, I offer this  wonderful early mid-century set of Sterling Silver & 14K Gold Shadow Box earrings and necklace by the renown Ed Levin. 
These fantastic pieces are in excellent condition and would make a truly remarkable Gift to be cherished and past down through generations. 
Known for his fluid designs, these are just a perfect example of his early works.  So simple but elegant; a must have for those of you who appreciate the famous designers of this era. 
They are stamped Sterling and have the Ed Levin hallmark in script.  The necklace is done in the shadow box design. The top oval is a brushed sterling silver; the bottom oval is 14K gold over sterling silver and the suspended ball in the middle is solid 14K gold. 
The necklace is 18"" long and the pendant is 1"" tall and almost 1/2 wide. The earrings are the same size. The total weight is 9.6g.
Ed Levin passed away February 23, 2008. In a Tribute article in Modern Silver magazine, Nancy E Schindler said "" Levin's work has always had the uncanny ability to look flawless and modern in design while maintaining an elegant simplicity. Good jewelry design doesn't need to be complicated. In fact, the very best of modern jewelry design is able to convey a sense of monumentality while being sneakily simple and unexpectedly comfortable. Ed Levin's work has possessed those qualities since the 1950's when he began his role as a pioneer in modern jewelry design.""

3167,Vintage PFAFF 130 Sewing Machine,"
            This vintage PFAFF 130 sewing machine has just been cleaned and serviced. It is running like new! Made in Germany, these machines are known for their quality construction. 
This machine was purchased new in 1953 and has had one owner. The motor and belt were replaced several years ago. I have the original PFAFF motor and will include it with purchase if desired.
Comes with several genuine PFAFF attachments, the bobbin case, and the original metal PFAFF storage box. Also included are the power cord with foot control, operating manual, a few PFAFF needles. 
The original carrying case is in great vintage condition. It had a broken handle, which has been replaced with a new custom made leather handle. The snap closures work perfectly.
This heavy duty PFAFF machine weighs approx. 44lbs., so shipping costs will reflect the weight.
Message me if additional information or photos are needed. Always glad to oblige.
Thanks for shopping with Lady Esther's Vintage!        ",350.00,4.9286,"Vintage item from the 1950s

9970,Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Dog Tongue Sticker,"
            This is a perfectly sized kiss-cut laminate sticker to make your Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controller look more like a dog face.
As many have already noticed, the Joy-Con controllers (yes, we know that's redundant) for the new Nintendo Switch console look like derpy dog faces. 
So we constructed a high-quality kiss-cut vinyl sticker to really drive that concept home.
The stickers are pretty small, measuring about 1.5"" by 1"", but they're the perfect size to fit on the face of the Joy-Con, just under the ""nose."" We hope you like them as much as we do.
Features:
- Kiss-cut with no border around the sticker to improve realism on Joy-Con
- Matte laminate material
- Long-lasting, super-duper sticky
- Able to be removed without leaving residue or tarnishing the finish
- Spill resistant maybe? (not tested)
- Cat resistant probably (yeah, kinda tested actually)
- Pretty small (but a good fit)
- Easy to apply (especially if you have thumbs)
- Looks OK on other stuff
Requirements:
- A Joy-Con or other item deserving of a dog tongue
- Opposable Thumbs probably        ",4.00,4.9286,"Handmade item

We love custom orders! So, if you require a different size or shape please message us and we will create a custom listing just for you. There is no limit to what we can create together!
*****
Please note that due to the nature of the leather and to the fact that our labels are laser cut and laser engraved hues and grain can vary slightly from tag to tag. Moreover the tags will have a specific smell, typical to laser cut leather. This is what differentiates real leather from faux or eco leather  and makes your tags unique.
We do clean the tags individually after laser cutting them but some black residue may still occur when touching the edges, but it can be removed by simply using a wipe.
