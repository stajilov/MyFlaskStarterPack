- Making someone happy.
The white plastic case can easily be removed if not needed. 
However, it is designed to protect the clockwork mechanism from dust and debris. 
The dimensions of the movements with the case are:
2-1/8 inches x 1-7/8 inches wide and  1-1/16 inches high
(54mm x 48mm x 27mm)
With your purchase you will receive:
-  A Gold ""T"" winding key plus an extra spare key 
-  Mounting screws with the proper thread size
-  An 18 Note movement in the song of your choice
-  A white case to protect the inner mechanism
-  Fast delivery 
-  A guarantee that you will get a free replacement if the movement arrives not working
-  and ""Vintage Quality"" Customer Service 
They sound beautiful and play for up to 3 minutes. Each one is tested just prior to shipping.
 
If you need several movements or a song in my full list below, select “Other” and leave me a message. 
With this purchase you will receive standard “T Bar” key and a spare key.  If you would rather have a ""Safety Key” that will not unscrew once it is installed leave me a message when you place the order and I will include one at no extra charge. See this listing for more info.
