14278,Sapphire 5 grams or 1 oz - Mica Pigment Powder ~ Perfect for Soap Making ~ Cosmetics ~ Resin ~ Dye ~ Makeup ~Nail Polish,"
            This Mica Pigment is perfect to use in a range of crafts. Soap (melt and pour, cold process, liquid soap), Cosmetics (eye shadow, nail polish, lotion, blush, lip gloss), Resin, and much more!
All colors are measured by weight.
All colors come weighing 5 grams, 1 ounce, or 1 ounce in a jar.
This colorant is oil soluble. For bath bombs I recommend using Polysorbate 80. Polysorbate is a dispersing agent and will help bind the colorant and oils used in the bath bomb with the water. This will prevent the colorant and oils from sticking to your tub and skin.  Polysorbate 80 also helps give the bath bomb a little more fizz. Usage rate is up to 6%.
Ingredients: Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Ultramarine Blue

            Sterling silver hoop or sleeper earrings. 
I sell three different sizes 20mm, 16mm and 12mm - they are made from 1.25mm wire. 
PRICE IS FOR ONE PAIR OF HOOP EARRINGS. 
EARRING UPGRADE: Please purchase whichever size earrings you wish me to swap for the silver plated hoops currently on a pair of my earrings. You will not be charged additional postage/shipping when purchased with a pair of my earrings.
Please note: the 12mm hoops are probably too small for the resin drops I make that just slip onto the hoops. Please ask if in doubt. 
NON UPGRADE: They are also available to purchase on their own - they do not need to be an upgrade for a pair of my resin earrings. 
These are the only sterling silver hoops I have in stock - I do not have any other sizes/designs/shapes.

18131,Helix piercing ring hoop piercing helix hoop piercing 18 Gauge helix ring piercing gold silver rose gold helix ring,"
            Sturdy helix, cartilage, nose piercing.
Gold Filled, rose gold filled or sterling silver.
Available in different sizes. the inner diameter is measured 
Important: 18 Gauge wire piercings are a bit harder to bend into place, especially when ordered in smaller ( 5-6mm ) sizes. It is best to have a helping hand.
-- The piercing ends are ground smooth. Then the piercing is polished, disinfected and packed in a reclosable small plastic bag.
-- To put it on, just bend the two ends sideweys. Don't pull them apart, that would deform the piercing.
*Sensivity*
Most people tolerate sterling silver and gold filled well. But if an increased sensitivity is known, maybe Surgical Steel (or similar) piercings should be chosen.
* Gold Filled *
Gold filled components contain 100 times more gold than gold-plated components. In normal use, gold filled jewelry lasts for a lifetime.
HERE SOME INFORMATIONS ABOUT GAUGE AND DIAMETER
* Gauge*
There are various wire sizes, which are referred to with gauge. They range in piercings of 16 gauge (very thick wire) up to 26 gauge (extremely thin wire). So the smaller the gauge number, the thicker the piercing.
Most Piercers use 18 gauge piercings on helix piercings (but it varies from 16-20 Gauge)
And 20 or 18 Gauge piercings for nose piercings.
But once you change your first piercing, you can vary with the gauge ( wear a very delicate gauge or a thicker one)
If you are wearing an 18 gauge right now and order a thinner 22 gauge,  it will be painful to stretch your piercing back out if you go back to the 18 gauge.  I recommend only going up or down one gauge size.for example, I wear 26 through 22 ga rings.  If I've worn a 26 ga ring for awhile, I will size up to a 24 ga for a few days before trying to put in the thicker 22 ga wire.  
16 Gauge -  1.3 mm
18 gauge -  1 mm<- This is the wire thickness of this piercing.
20 Gauge -  0.81 mm
22 Gauge -  0.64 mm
24 Gauge -  00.51 mm
26 Gauge -  0.4 mm
Gauge 18 - 24 Piercings are available at Dearest Rosali --  Piercings.
Picture 4, from left to right: 18, 20, 22, 24 Gauge.
* Diameter * (Measured is the inner diameter)
-6mm -  Average size nose piercing. this size is more worn on the nose. usually it fits, but if you have a slightly thicker nasal cartilage, 7mm will probably fit better. Also small helix ring.
-7mm
-8mm -  Piercing Average size Helix.
-9mm
-10mm -.  Slightly larger, possibly more on Helix) (general ear) worn.
Piercing on my finger has a 7mm diameter.
If you are unsure which diameter to pick:
Simply stand in front of the mirror and place the ruler on your nose to measure the distance between the piercing hole and the edge of the nostril where the bottom of the hoop would rest.  Be sure to add a millimeter so the ring can move freely.        ",10.38,4.9068,"Handmade item
