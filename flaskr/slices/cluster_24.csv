            Uniform Ruffle Pants in Khaki (tan), navy, or black. 
I use high-quality fabrics because I know these will be worn often! All colors are now made with Riley Blake Boutique cotton fabric. 
Smaller ruffle than my other pants meet the stricter guidelines for school uniforms. Available in 2"" ruffle or 3"" ruffle. 4th picture shows the different size ruffle. Model is wearing 3"" ruffle. 
*** Measurements: you can request and in-between size, just message me! For room to grow, I recommend starting out with the pants hitting the floor barefoot, this allows for shoes to raise them, shrinkage, and 1-2"" growth. 
*** waist should be less than actual waist measurement for the elastic to hold the pants up

1729,ON SALE! Black Train Clock ; Analog Clock,"
            This black plastic clock is a one of a kind piece! It is an analog clock that works keeping time. The clock also has a timer, but unfortunately does not work consistently. When the timer goes off, the train is supposed to begin chugging. The train does chug, but the chugging happens randomly and inconsistently. This clock takes four AA batteries.

DISCOVER MAPS!
Original maps for the collector, enthusiast & casual consumer. 
As a collector & trader of maps and prints for the last 20 years, I've often found myself transfixed by an antique map. For me, these relics of a time long-past evoke images of exploration, discovery & adventure in a world that seemed limitless. They represent the best efforts of curious minds to define the boundaries of the world we inhabit. They tell the stories of long-crumbled empires & kingdoms that controlled vast dominions, as well as the tiny princely states & free cities that swarmed up in different times and places. Collectively, they show the rise and fall of powerful nation states, the demarcation of cultural and ethnic borders, the might of armies and the spread of languages, ideas, and cultures. 
Before telephone, television, airplanes, email and computers, there was a time when the world was hungry for images of what was located beyond the next ocean, over the next river, behind tall mountains, and across the distant plains. This image-hungry world found nourishment in the same maps & prints that I proudly offer in my store. 
Maps are not limited to ancient pieces that depict long-forgotten realms. Discover Maps offers a wide selection of maps from various timeframes, and it will be apparent to any visitor that I enjoy the details, coloring and modernism of maps by Julius Bien, Thomas Sinclair, A. Hoen, and George Harris, among others, all of whom printed maps from the mid-1800's to the early 1900's. As pioneers of chromolithography, the innovative efforts of these mapmakers permitted incredible detail, vibrant colors, and larger production runs. Oftentimes, these lithographers worked under the auspices of geographers and geologists of the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Given the task of locating railroad routes, harbors, navigable rivers and mineral deposits, USGS expeditions fanned out across the country. These expeditions documented the geology, topography, fauna, flora, fossils and indigenous cultures of the United States of America. The maps that resulted from these expeditions are important not only for their technical detail and their role in the economic development of the United States, but also for their artistry and beauty.
I offer a wonderful selection of maps and prints from the 16th Century to the 20th Century, all guaranteed original. I do not sell copies, digital downloads or reproductions. I add items to my store on a daily basis, and hope that you will visit often and explore the mapped world.

********************************************************
A NOTE ON VINTAGE AND ANTIQUE
As part of their charm, most antique and vintage pieces may have small imperfections and flaws from the manufacturing process or from use and wear over time. I take extra effort to accurately describe the condition of each item and to note and photograph (when possible) any flaws in the description. Please be aware that some situations, such as wear on gilt edging, are very common and add to the unique character of the piece.
CANADIAN SHIPPING
The shipping prices listed for Canada do NOT include the Territories. For shipping to the Territories, please contact me with a postal code for a quote.
SHIPPING TO USA
The shipping prices listed are for the 48 contiguous states only. To ship outside of this region, please contact me with a zip code for a quote.  US Customs requires that I include your phone number on the customs slip with your package.  Please send this to me as soon as possible so that I can get your order out the door.  All customs, import taxes, and duty fees are the responsibility of the buyer.  Ophélie Languish bears no responsibility whatsoever for delays in international shipping.
INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING
I do ship internationally to most countries. Please provide me with a country and postal code for a quote. Please note that Ophélie Languish bears no responsibility whatsoever for delays in international shipping. All customs, import taxes, and duty fees are the responsibility of the buyer. 
OTHER SHIPPING NOTES
Shipping from Canada can be a little on the expensive side. Because of this, I always seek the most economical method of shipping possible that is insurable.
Each package is lovingly packed and wrapped with care to ensure that you receive your items intact and damage-free. This sometimes adds a little extra bulk and/or weight to your order but it is worth it in the long run.
I do not make money on shipping fees. If the actual shipping cost is less than the quoted and paid shipping fee, I will refund the difference to you if it is greater than 1.00. If the actual shipping cost is greater than what has been quoted and paid, then Ophélie Languish will absorb the extra cost.
The flat rate shipping fees listed are estimates. Unless the customer wants to upgrade his or her shipping method, then the customer will never pay more than what is listed. In most cases, however, I end up refunding money back to the customer after I ship the item at the post office.
Please read the rest of my policies prior to purchase. Merci!        ",9.25,4.9231,"Vintage item from the 1960s

SIZE SUGGESTIONS
Keep in mind, the vintage denim tends to run a bit smaller than today's sizing, and the material is a bit thick. Due to this, depending on how snug you want them to fit, most people move up one or two sizes from their regular fit. 
I like to breathe a bit more in mine, and have thicker legs, so I move from a US size 6-8 to a size 10-12 when I where these. 
____________________

I only list the sizes that I currently have available, to guarantee quick shipping to your doorstep. If you do not see your size in stock, keep in mind that I restock once or twice a week. If you ""follow"" my shop it will keep you updated on any additional listings.

            This item is a silk fabric pouch.  It is approximately 6"" square when folded up.  There is a ribbon to tie it shut.
It is in the original box with original tissue paper, labeled ""Hervey Associates New York, NY"" and ""Black & American Beauty"", which I am guessing is the name of the color pattern?

4974,Depression Era Glass Fruit Knife,"
            Interesting heavy glass fruit knife from the 1920s.  It's in very nice condition with few nicks to the frosted blade.  The handle is clear with  "" PAT 12-14-20 B.K.Co"" in raised letters.
The knife is 9 1/2"" long.  It is a bit unusual.  Most of the fruit knives I see from that time have a curved handle and flowers.  This is unadorned, very clear, and Deco-like.
I'm including the almost demolished box for the graphics.  And it might not be the real box since it has ""Rust Kraft"" on the side.        ",13.00,4.9634,"Vintage item

5512,PRE-SUMMER SALE Vintage 50s Black Mesh Gloves black gloves designer gloves accessories,"
            I love these vintage black mesh gloves! They look adorable on.
I wear a size 6-1/2 & they fit me and will fit smaller hands as well and maybe even a size 7 but am not sure about that. There is a lot of stretch in them.  Nice lineal ribbing detailing on the top of the gloves.  No mrg. or size tags inside.
9"" - 10"" from the middle finger to the top of the glove. The palm is 3-1/8"" across or 6-1/4"" circumference.  From the top of the glove to the end of the thumb is 6"" - 7"" when stretched. 
They would look great with a sexy black cocktail dress or evening gown!

When buying vintage clothes on line, one must own a tape measure & measure a similar garment to see if the new garment falls within the measurements that are given in the description. You cannot look at the measurements & think that those are your own measurements & that it will fit. All garments need to be a few inches larger than one’s own body measurements for a good fit.
All items are wrapped with acid-free tissue. No item will ever be sent wrinkled beyond belief in an old plastic grocery bag inside of an old reused marked up envelope as has happened to me by some sellers. I think too much of my customers & my products to do that to anyone. 
All vintage items are just that vintage & not new straight from the mall– and may show some imperfections, wear and use because of the age. I try to list any imperfection but a small one could slip by unintentionally. All sales are final and no returns.
Items are shipped parcel post, priority or first class depending on the weight, destination & what the item is at seller’s discretion. 
Shipping charges do not include insurance & I strongly recommend purchasing insurance for all items. Contact me before buying & I can add the insurance charge on        ",44.99,4.881,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            ********** The Flat cap **********
A flat cap is a rounded cap with a small stiff brim in front. The hat is also known as a cabbie cap, longshoreman's cap, cloth cap, scally cap, Wigens cap, ivy cap, golf cap, duffer cap, duckbill cap, driving cap, bicycle cap, Jeff cap, Irish cap, Newsboy cap, Crook cap, or a Paddy cap and in regional varieties: in Scotland as a bunnet, in Wales as a Dai cap, and in New Zealand, as a cheese-cutter. Cloths used to make the cap include wool, tweed (most common), and cotton The inside of the cap is commonly lined for comfort and warmth.
The style can be traced back to the 14th century in Northern England and parts of Southern Italy when it was more likely to be called a ""bonnet"", which term was replaced by ""cap"" before about 1700, except in Scotland, where it continues to be referred to as a ""bunnet"". When English and Irish emigrants went to the United States, they took the flat cap with them.
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when men predominantly wore some form of headgear, flat caps were commonly worn throughout Britain and Ireland. Versions in finer cloth were also considered to be suitable casual countryside wear for upper-class English men (hence the contemporary alternative name golf cap). Flat caps were worn by fashionable young men in the 1920s. Boys of all classes in the United Kingdom wore flat caps during this period.

Here is a French ""Au Printemps Paris"" men's flat cap. This is a vintage cap and has poppers to raise or lower the height of the hat. Made from a thick wool material, this hat is in very good condition for its age and would make the perfect accessory to any event or occasion. Perfect for the outdoors this hat has been lined on the inside for comfort and warmth. 
Printemps is a company from Paris in France, the word Printemps means spring, and this company is worldwide known for their quality, finishing and for their outdoor fashion and men's clothing and accessories. This hat was made sometime between 1912 -1970 so is very old. 
The hat would make a great addition to someone's collection, would be a wonderful gift for some special such as the groom or for someone within the bridal party, for a special occasion, or for your own personal use. It would even make a great display accessory.
Measures 10 cm in height, 18 cm inside diameter and 25 cm to the peak.  The circumference is 56 cm or 22 inches.
This hat is unique and is in a GOOD CONDITION the poppers are in fully working condition and I have not noticed any holes but as this hat is Vintage its not in perfect condition.

My dog sweaters easily fit standard sized dogs. They have a roomy neck and legs so they can be put on and taken off fairly easily.  If you dog breed is has a larger neck size (Boston Terrier, French Bulldog, Pug, etc.), please include the measurements with your order. Also, if you dog is a little rounder around the belly, please measure girth as well.
I make the length on my sweaters on the shorter side (as listed on my size chart). These  standard sizes work well for both male and female dogs.  If your dog is a “long” breed (Daschund, Shih Tzu, etc.), please contact me prior to ordering.  I will need the length you want for the sweater.  There is an additional charge for a longer/larger sweater for the extra material used.  I will need to make a custom listing for you.

Please check the size guide to make sure my standard measurements will work with your dog.  Each listing has a size guide and so does my About page.

            You know a strong cup of coffee can practically raise the dead - or at least get you up on Monday morning. But, those grounds have a lot more going on in the regeneration department than just getting your butt out the door.
When rubbed all over, those granules will tone down any redness or inflammation you’ve got going on, and smooth your skin to perfection. Plus, all that scrubbing gets those antioxidants to sink in and protect you from free radicals - meaning fewer wrinkles (you’re welcome.) We’ve upped the anti-aging game by adding a dose of Dead Sea Mineral Salt - which contains a whopping 21 different minerals that moisturize, smooth, and strengthen cell membranes (no weight lifting involved), plus a dash of tea tree oil to beat up any nasty bacteria before they have the chance to do anything naughty.

What Is Lavender?
Lavender oil comes from lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), an easy-to-grow, evergreen shrub that produces clumps of beautiful, scented flowers above green or silvery-gray foliage.1 The plant is native to northern Africa and the mountainous Mediterranean regions, and thrives best in sunny, stony habitats. Today, it grows throughout southern Europe, the United States, and Australia.
Lavender has been used for over 2,500 years. Ancient Persians, Greeks, and Romans added the flowers to their bathwater to help wash and purify their skin.3 In fact, the word ""lavender"" comes from the Latin word ""lavare,"" which means ""to wash.""
Phoenicians, Arabians, and Egyptians used lavender as a perfume, as well as for mummification – mummies were wrapped in lavender-dipped garments. In Greece and Rome, it was used as an all-around cure,5 while in Medieval and Renaissance Europe, it was scattered all over stone castle floors as a natural disinfectant and deodorant. Lavender was even used during the Great Plague of London in the 17th century. People fastened lavender flowers around their waists, believing it will protect them from the Black Death.6
High-quality lavender oil has a sweet, floral, herbaceous, and slightly woody scent. Its color can range from pale yellow to yellow-green, but it can also be colorless.
Uses of Lavender Oil
Both lavender and lavender oil are valued for their fragrance and versatility. The flowers are used in potpourris, crafting, and home décor, while the essential oil is added to bath and body care products, such as soaps, perfumes, household cleaners, and laundry detergent.
Lavender oil is known for its anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antidepressant, antiseptic, antibacterial, and antimicrobial properties. It also has antispasmodic, analgesic, detoxifying, hypotensive, and sedative effects.8 Lavender oil is one of the most well-known essential oils in aromatherapy, and can be:
Added to your bath or shower to relieve aching muscles and stress.
Massaged on your skin as a relief for muscle or joint pain, as well as for skin conditions like burns, acne, and wounds. Make sure to dilute it with a carrier oil.
Inhaled or vaporized. You can use an oil burner or add a few drops to a bowl of hot water, and then breathe in the steam.
Added to your hand or foot soak. Add a drop to a bowl of warm water before soaking your hands or feet.
Used as a compress by soaking a towel in a bowl of water infused with a few drops of lavender oil. Apply this to sprains or muscle injuries.
I also recommend adding lavender oil to your list of natural cleaning products. You can mix it with baking soda to make an all-natural antibacterial scrub for your bathroom and kitchen.
Composition of Lavender Oil
Lavender oil has a chemically complex structure with over 150 active constituents.10 This oil is rich in esters, which are aromatic molecules with antispasmodic (suppressing spasms and pain), calming, and stimulating properties.
The chief botanical constituents of lavender oil are linalyl acetate, linalool (a non-toxic terpene alcohol that has natural germicidal properties), terpinen-4-ol, and camphor.11 Other constituents in lavender oil that are responsible for its antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory properties include cis-ocimene, lavandulyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, limonene, and geraniol.
Benefits of Lavender Oil
Lavender oil is known for its calming and relaxing  properties, and has been used for alleviating insomnia, anxiety, depression, restlessness, dental anxiety,13 and stress.14 It has also been proven effective for nearly all kinds of ailments, from pain to infections.
I am particularly fascinated by lavender oil's potential in fighting antifungal-resistant skin and nail infections. Scientists from the University of Coimbra found that lavender oil is lethal to skin-pathogenic strains known as dermatophytes, as well as various Candida species.16 The study, published in Journal of Medical Microbiology,found that lavender oil kills fungi by damaging their cell walls (a mechanism that I believe could apply to bacteria and viruses as well). The best part is that this oil does not cause resistance, unlike antibiotics.
For more about this topic, read my article ""Lavender Oil Has Potent Antifungal Effect.""
Lavender oil can also be used to:
Relieve pain. It can ease sore or tense muscles, joint pain and rheumatism, sprains, backache, and lumbago. Simply massage lavender oil onto the affected area. Lavender oil may also help lessen pain following needle insertion.
Treat various skin disorders like acne, psoriasis, eczema, and wrinkles. It also helps form scar tissues, which may be essential in healing wounds,19 cuts, and burns. Lavender can also help soothe insect bites and itchy skin.20 According to Texas-based dermatologist Dr. Naila Malik, it's a natural anti-inflammatory, so it helps reduce itching, swelling, and redness.
Keep your hair healthy. It helps kill lice, lice eggs, and nits. The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database (NMCB) says that lavender is possibly effective for treating alopecia areata (hair loss), boosting hair growth by up to 44 percent after just seven months of treatment.
Improve your digestion. This oil helps stimulate the mobility of your intestine and stimulates the production of bile and gastric juices, which may help treat stomach pain, indigestion, flatulence, colic, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Relieve respiratory disorders. Lavender oil can help alleviate respiratory problems like colds and flu, throat infections, cough, asthma, whooping cough, sinus congestion, bronchitis, tonsillitis, and laryngitis. It can be applied on your neck, chest, or back, or inhaled via steam inhalation or through a vaporizer.
Stimulates urine production, which helps restore hormonal balance, prevent cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder), and relieve cramps and other urinary disorders.
Improve your blood circulation. It helps lower elevated blood pressure levels, and can be used for hypertension.
Lavender oil can help ward off mosquitoes and moths. It is actually used as an ingredient in some mosquito repellents.
Warning
Natural essential oils are highly concentrated and should be used with care.
Keep out of reach of children. Avoid contact with eyes. If pregnant or lactating, consult your healthcare practitioner before use. Not for internal use.        ",4.97,4.8824,"Materials:  essential oils, glass bottle, dropper, lavendar, lavender

Leather hide has been processed and tanned naturally by sun and oil to give the finished antique, vintage rustic feel and look to leather bag. This means that each hide might be slightly different from the other ones. You won’t be able to find two leather bags exactly the same look due to unique hand finishing touch. Sizes may vary slightly as well. Each piece of leather might have unique scratches and discolorations which add specific characteristics to natural handmade leather bag. 
Please note, every item is a one-of-a-kind original masterpiece so might come with minor scrapes and scratches. Also it may slightly vary from the displayed pictures. This hand crafted leather bag is a perfect companion for everyday use or a wonderful gift for those you love the most.

            Leather Camera Strap for digital & film cameras with Quick Release Clips | Tan Leather Neck Strap | Thin Leather Camera Strap 
Description
A classic style leather camera strap featuring quick release snaps for the simple, easy removal of your camera strap if you wish to remove it from your camera body for stashing after use. 
Each strap is hand made from high quality premium leather providing reliable support for your camera without compromise.  
Its simple style is ideal for both film and digital cameras, making it the perfect accessory for the street photographer or those looking for a strap that's a little more stylish than the OEM strap the camera arrives with. 
Features - 
Wide choice of lengths to suit 
1/2"" Wide

Nickel plate quick release snaps
Split rings for camera attachment included
Hand Cut & Hand Made
----------
About Me
I make custom leather camera straps by hand here in the UK. Each strap is hand cut from premium English vegetable tanned leather. I use only traditional leather working methods for creating each strap, no machinery or automation is utilised in the making process.
Each strap is finished to a high finish, using high quality protective balm for a strap that will last.
----------
Notes
We aim to ship your strap to you within 5- 7 working days, subject to order levels. If we are unable to ship within that time scale, I will advise you with an estimated delivery time and if you are not happy with this I am more than happy to issue you with a refund.
Care of your strap
We finish each strap with a blend of wax and balms for a soft, protective finish.   However, if you find your strap a little stiff, this will disappear in use to a creamy, smooth soft comfortable strap. 
Our leather is tanned and dyed and therefore we would make you aware there is a minimal chance that in very damp or humid conditions the dye may run. Being from England, of course I have yet to experience this, but I would ask that you bear this in mind when using your strap in such conditions.
If you happen to get your strap wet (something that happens in the UK a lot!), please allow it to dry naturally. By forcing the leather to dry you run the risk of the leather cracking. I would also advise you use a good quality leather oil or wax occasionally to keep your strap in great condition.

(The Peacock film is a film from Lomography. It is originally slide film: you can also develop it as slide film. But when you have this film developed as regular color film (cross-processing) the results will be very cool.

11420,Wizard of Oz Bookmark - Ruby Slippers Bookmark - Witch Legs Bookmark - Wicked Witch Bookmark,"
            SHIPPING IN THE US IS FAST AND FREE! 14 Different Styles to Choose From! The witch legs will be the same (delightful striped stockings with ruby slippers) but you get to choose the body of your witch bookmark. See additional listing photos for style numbers.
This fun, whimsical bookmark is inspired by the land of Oz! I came up with the idea after reading ""Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.""
AS SEEN IN THE PEOPLE MAGAZINE EXTRA HOLIDAY 2012 EDITION 
This Original Wicked Witch of the East Ruby Slippers bookmark has been featured on The Daily What, Craftzine, Craftster, Pinterest, The Reader's Nook and many more places on the web! You won't find a copycat here. It’s important to note that when you purchase this bookmark from my shop, you are supporting the original creator of the Wicked Witch Legs bookmark. After my bookmark blog post and photo went viral in 2011 (http://goo.gl/HioZc), others have taken the idea and run with it. So please take consider that when making your buying choice. A purchase from my shop, 
KiraNichols.etsy.com
, would mean a lot to me and my family!
Each bookmark is handmade to order by me, so the bookmark you receive will vary slightly from the photos. 
The bookmark body measures approx. 3x4'' for the Original Registered Style, and 6x2"" for all the others. These sturdy bookmarks are made of high quality printed 32 pt cardstock. This cardstock is a full 1mm thick! That's about the thickness of three average business cards put together, so sturdier than your average bookmark! I sculpt those Wicked Witch of the East legs with care from polyclay (no mold used!) and then I hand paint them and add all the details so your bookmark is just wicked with witchy goodness.

Bookmarks will be shipped in sturdy boxes to avoid damage during travel. Will be shipped via USPS First Class mail within 1-3 business days of receipt of payment. Orders in the USA will come with a delivery confirmation number that will be sent to you upon shipping.
International buyers, your package will be shipped promptly, but please allow up to 6 weeks for delivery. Also, buyers are responsible for knowing and paying their own country's import taxes and tariffs ***Please take a moment to review my shop policies before making your purchase.***

Or you can do any name, date, or short message on the front or back (1-10 characters). The name/date will be on the righthand side of the bar unless otherwise requested. Please let us know what you would like engraved (up to 10 characters on each side) in the note at checkout.
THIS LISTING INCLUDES
Each bracelet comes in a little kraft jewelry box with a gift note (or blank if you prefer). It will be wrapped in a twine bow with a name tag on the outside (if desired). Please let us know in the note at checkout the name of the recipient (for the tag) and the note you would like inside the box. If you do not let us know the note you would like, we will include the note in the first picture and no tag. Customize the note however you would like, just keep it to a couple sentences. (Let us know what you would like in the note at checkout).
GIFT NOTE OPTIONS (see last picture):

MATERIALS
The bar and findings are gold-plated over brass with a special anti-tarnish coating and the chain is gold-plated over copper also with an anti-tarnish coating.

            Whether you're looking for a decorative comb for the side or back of your hair, this delicate diamanté piece is the perfect finishing touch to add a bit of bling to your bridal hair.
For this piece I have used a mixture of diamanté beads and glass pearl beads on a silver plated small comb. The wire I used for this is silver plated as I find it easier to bend and mould but I do have a sterling silver option available at a slightly higher price. 
The comb comes in a black presentation box. If you would like this piece customised in any way please get in touch.        ",33.15,4.88,"Handmade item

14131,Bee and Honeycomb Stencil (Nature 002),"
            Stencil size: 7.5 x 5.5 inches.
All the stencils offered at The Art-Full Life are designed by Aurora Davison to make creating more fun; even time consuming complex designs are easier to achieve for art journalling, scrapbooking, planners, mixed media artists, and home decorating.
All paint mediums can be used from watercolours, inks, oil paints, spray paints, acrylics, air brushing, glass etching cream, etc...
 
Each stencil is precision cut from a durable 5 mil mylar, and designed with convenient snag free rounded corners. 
This material is tear resistant, solvent-proof and thin enough to achieve outstanding detail when stenciling, yet strong and flexible enough allowing the plastic to conform to any surface without the build up on the design edge found with thick stencils creating an annoying ""paint ridge”.
The translucent glossy finish also allows for greater visibility for easier positioning, and with proper care can be reused many, even hundreds of times. Simply clean and store flat after use, a plastic sleeve binder is perfect for storage, keeping stencils organised, and intricate design elements from snagging.
CLEANING recommendation:
Acrylic, latex and other water based paints: soapy warm water or use a baby wipe.
Stubborn dried water based paints: soak in warm water until the paint peels off. 
Spray paints and oil based paints: paint thinner, mineral spirits, or anything recommended by the paint manufacturer.
Stencil adhesive: nail polish remover (acetone), De-Solv-It, or any suitable glue remover.
Stencils are packaged in a cellophane resealable bag and shipped in a heavy duty cardboard envelope.
The Art-Full Life stencils are guaranteed against manufacturing defects for one year. Just return the damaged stencil and a copy of your receipt, and a free replacement (of the same stencil) will be shipped to you.
Artwork for demonstration purposes only, it is not included with the stencil.        ",4.65,4.9615,"Handmade item

14174,Olympus Trip 35 - Vintage 35mm Point and Shoot Camera - Very Collectable,"
            The Trip 35 is a 35mm compact camera, manufactured by Olympus. It was introduced in 1967 and discontinued, after a lengthy production run, in 1984. The Trip name was a reference to its intended market – people who wanted a compact, functional camera for holidays. During the 1970s it was the subject of an advertising campaign that featured popular British photographer David Bailey. 
The Trip 35 was a point and shoot model with a 40mm f2.8 lens, solar-powered selenium light meter, and just two shutter speeds. In 'A' mode, the camera operated as a Program automatic, choosing either 1/40th sec or 1/200th sec. The camera could also sync with flash, and had a range of aperture settings, from f2.8 to f22. In flash sync mode the shutter was set at 1/40. Apart from a simple four-position zone focus system, and an ISO setting from 25–400,[2] the camera had no other photographic controls. The camera had a Prontor-Compur sync connector and a hot shoe. Its lens was a coated Zuiko 40mm f/2.8, with four elements in three groups.
The four-element Tessar lens, still impressive today, gave high-quality images. If used with modern film emulsions, the results can be very good.
The use of a selenium photocell to select the shutter speeds and aperture let novices use the camera as a ""point & shoot"", with good results obtained most of the time. And no battery was needed to power the camera, an important consideration when travelling where batteries might not be available. 
The camera is in very good condition and has had a new seal installed and its light meter is fully functioning, red flagging up when the subject is too dark.
Specifications.
Viewfinder: Standard Albada, with parallax marks. Red indication for too little light. Trick peephole to see exposure and focus settings as set on lens. The ridged window to the right of the finder window is fake, mimicking a rangefinder.

14182,Sawyers Nomad 620 Brown and Gold Medium Format Camera,"
            This listing is for one Sawyer's Nomad 620 Camera in working condition. This camera looks basically like it just came off of the shelf. 
This camera has crazy amounts of retro appeal. It is chocolate brown with gold accents.   
These cameras take 620 roll film which can still be procured online or you can buy the empty spools and load them with readily available 120 (medium format) film you would like. 
Internal parts, shutter button and winding knob all move freely. Shutter doesn't stick at all. 
Camera shows some minor wear, but it does not impede the functionality. (As with most products that are over 60 years old)

14183,Rolleiflex Near Mint Camera,"
            In near mint condition, and I only say ""near"" in case I missed a microscopic flaw. A truly beautiful survivor with crystal clear lenses. Includes the leather case, which isn't mint, but still together and without any serious damage; just scuffs. 
The serial number is 726351. I'm not an expert and my google research was the most confusing ever. Every site placed it as different model, but most at least dated it to late 40's. If you feel like educating me, please do. 
The top lens is serial #622990 and is a Heidosmat 1:2.8/75. 
The bottom lens is serial #901331 and is a Zeiss Opton Tessar 1:3.5 f=75mm
I'm asking a lot for it, because I collect cameras, love the Rolleiflex, and have never been able to keep one for more than a week. The price will drop in due time. Educate me on it's value. 
Please look closely at all photos until you feel you have a good understanding of the condition and ask questions or request more photos if you have any doubts or concerns.

14192,Vintage Hhalf-Frame Camera Penti I. Welta Penti.Penti Golden and Red.,"
            Penti Golden and Red.
Тhe camera are in  good visual condition.
Shutter speed works only in 60 and 125. Other speeds does not work.
Comes with original leather case. Some leather case was a ruptured.
The Penti was made in East Germany by Welta from c.1959. It was available with a white, red , black or blue body.
Once the East German optical industry introduced a 35mm film load system concurrent to Agfa's West German Rapid film. This SL-System (SL-System=Schnell-Lade-System : Fast Load System) used two equal cartridges, one loaded, the other empty. The film advance system shifted the film via the image plane from one cartridge into the other, image by image.
The Penti may have been the finest compact camera for this film load system, a viewfinder camera with a complete set of manual setting controls, all as rings around the lens: one for distance, one for aperture, and one for shutter speed. It could make 72 18×24mm exposures on one strip of 35mm film. There was a 1:3.5/30 lens, a Meyer Domiplan or a Meyer Trioplan, and a flash synchronized leaf shutter (the synchronisation was adjusted for bulb flashes only!). Its speciality was the long film advance button. Once pushed into the camera the film was advanced to the next frame. After exposure the button appeared again in full length so that forgetting film advance was never an issue with this camera. The button can be seen pushed in, in the photo of the back, above. Voigtländer's Vitessa had a similar feature.
In 1961 the Penti II was introduced by Pentacon's predecessor VEB Kinowerke. This version made it a real classic, combining the uniquely designed full featured viewfinder camera with viewfinder-controlled coupled match-needle selenium meter. It was produced until 1977.
The Penti I was similar to the II, but without the meter. Both cameras are nearly identical externally - the Penti I still has fake ""exposure meter"" windows on both side of the viewfinder - so they can be easily confused. The Penti II bears however the ""PENTI II"" name below the lens. Both the Penti I and II could synchronise a bulb flash at 1/30 s and an electronic flash at any shutter speed. After the Penti I and II were introduced, the original Penti was sometimes called the Penti 0.        ",49.00,4.9667,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            Have you been looking for a way to liven up your packaging? Or maybe just a cool way to add your mark anywhere you need it!? Well look no further! I can make a custom stamp from your logo or artwork in a variety of sizes and two stamp styles! 
This stamp is made form your original artwork file! Your new  stamp is made of High-quality, commercial-grade red rubber and perfectly mounted to a traditional wood mount. Choose from handle or no handle.  Made to last for years!
Please see below for artwork specifications.
WHAT KIND OF FILE DO I NEED?
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
If you have an .eps .ai .pdf (vector file) thats great!!!! Please make sure any fonts have been converted to outlined shapes. Please no lines smaller than 1pt as they may not print well. All shapes and images must be 100% black. No color or greyscale
If you only have a .jpg please make sure it is Hi-resolution file (at least 300 dpi) at the size you would like the final stamp.
(example: If you need a 2x2"" stamp please have your file sized at least 2x2"" @ 300 dpi or larger)
Images should be  true black and white files ( no color, no greyscale). If any color editing needs to be done and can be done to your file in order to convert it into a stamp-able image, a 10 design fee will be required and a proof will be sent for approval. 
Occasionally an image may be too detailed or dainty. If I feel that something may not print on the final stamp I will let you know before it is made!

***PLEASE LEAVE YOUR FILE NAME IN THE NOTE TO SELLER AT CHECKOUT!*

15282,Dodecahedron Mold - 3D Printed - Geometric Mold - Cast Concrete-Resin-Wax-Soap,"
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dodecahedron is a geometric shape found in sacred geometry. It is linked to the Ethers/Universe and works through the higher Chakras from the 6th Third Eye and 7th Crown.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This 3D printed mold is perfect for the DIYer who enjoys making their own gifts or favors AND for the start-up looking for a cost efficient and reliable mold to get your business up and running!
The mold design has been optimized to keep the apparent seam line at a minimum. The wall thickness of our molds allows some flexibility when demolding yet retains its shape when your medium has been poured into it.
Available in 4 sizes (cast measurements):
SM - 2.25""W x 1.75""H 
MD - 3.25""W x 2.63""H
LG -  4.75""W x 3.88""H
XL -  6.88""W x 5.5""H
**Listing includes clamps**
~We accept custom orders and will work closely with you on your preferences and sizes.  
~Mold colors may vary depending on availability.  If a specific color is needed, please contact us prior to purchase and we will do our best to satisfy those requests.
**We DO NOT offer recommendations on how to pour and cast your desired medium.  In purchasing these molds, the end user assumes all responsibility.**
~This mold DOES NOT create center hole shown in concrete.  This creates a solid casting.

15332,"Unicorn cake topper set for unicorn party decoration. Assorted colors. Unicorn party cake kit, unicorn party ideas. Unicorn smash cake prop.","
            Decorate your cake quickly and easily with this unicorn cake topper set.
You'll get one 5"" horn, two ears, three eyelashes (in case one breaks) and 20 small flowers to put in the mane. 
These are cute for a first birthday party or a unicorn party, and could also be used to style a first birthday photo shoot.
The set is sized to be used on a 6-8"" cake, and is shown in the photos on a 6"" cake.
You can choose the horn and flower color at checkout. The pieces will be painted with a non-toxic luster dust in that color. These pieces are meant to be decorative, it's better if they're not eaten since they have skewers in them.
The set is made with gumpaste and is painted with luster dust. It is NOT covered in glitter, since the glitter that people are using is real plastic and shouldn't be put on a cake that kids will be eating! The FDA recently issued a warning against using ""edible glitter"" on food items. Please contact me for more information, but the super-sparkly glitter that you see on most unicorn cakes is NOT edible, it's non-toxic plastic craft glitter.

15412,5.5 inch square slump mold,"
            Slumping mold made of bisque is 5.5"" by 5. 5"". These are great all around slumping molds and stand up very well. I coat mine with 3 layers of kiln wash and it lasts forever! I included a photo of a plate using one of these molds so you could see what the finished plate looks like. The size is perfect for dessert or sushi. This is a great mold for the novice fuser because it only requires a couple of easy, straight, glass cuts.
If you purchase another item.  Please convo me first before placing your order so we can discuss shipping.  It's possible I can fit more than one item in a box and we can reduce the cost of shipping depending on the items ordered.        ",7.00,4.8824,"Handmade Supply

JEWELRY CARE INSTRUCTIONS
Fashion jewelry tarnishes when exposed to moisture, oils, salts and acids. 
- Thoroughly wipe each piece of jewelry with a soft, clean cloth as soon as you remove it. The goal is to remove any oil, salt or acid contaminants and to dry the piece.
-Store your fashion jewelry in its case, or in your jewelry box, with silica packets that typically come packaged with suitcases and shoes. If you don't have access to moisture-absorbing materials, make sure each jewelry piece is thoroughly dry, then seal it into a ziplock plastic bag for storage.
- Dry your hands before handling, or putting on, any piece of fashion jewelry from your collection. Remove your jewelry before showering, swimming or exercising.
- Minor tarnish can be buffed off with a jewelry polishing cloth, but cleaning heavy tarnish may also remove some gold or silver plate from the piece, so go easy. Store clean and dry in a soft cloth containers to avoid scratching the items; store individual pieces separately.

A bit about 14k GOLD FILLED,
Gold Filled is not like gold plated as there is approx 100 times more gold in gold fill, than there is on plated. 
Gold filled looks and usually wears as well as karat gold. 
Gold fill is very hard wearing and should last under normal wear conditions for a lifetime.

20319,Lose Fit Men's Beige Simple Cardigan - 50-50 wool-acrylic.,"
            Hello Gents. 
This Cardigan bit lose, you will not be able to Button up. Personally use in office when it's bit cold. Has two pockets, but this is mostly for look, never put anything there... Like Very Simple, same as price.
Office Day to day usage wear...
Color: Beige.
Just let me know, what color you are looking for and i believe we could make it for you
How to Specify Size during order.
This is mostly because we have different price for sizes. So, just take a look at spec of your close to find your size. If you have not alpha system, just take a look at pic: http://va-ju.com/sizes.png
For best FIT (This is very important)
Order requires personal measurements, because we want to deliver best fit for you. (if you are not able to take measurements, so just specify your size while posting order as told above)
So We need:
- Sleeve length from top of the shoulder to the wrist
- Biceps circumference
- Chest circumference
- Waist circumference
Here are compositions that we used:
- Wool 50% Acrylic 50%. (Made in Turkey) (click on pic, to see how yarn looks like, don't forget to use zoom button) 
Care: (This is important too, if you want to save shape of your item)
- Hand Wash only. (Best is cold water.) _ just take a look at some recommendations in the internet of how to easily wash wool item in machine (but we don't recommend to, feel free if you don't care)
- Flat Dry. Don't use vertical dry, because sweater will starch and lose fit. So this is really important.
If price is too big for you, just let me know, probably we may agree on some discount, if you will have some ideas why ))        ",110.00,4.8571,"Handmade item

            These gloves are great if the sleeves on a coat or jacket are too short! They'll keep you warm while still letting you use your hands and fingers for other things. The gloves cover just past the knuckles and go up to the middle of the forearm. Made from acrylic yarn
Gloves are approximately 10 inches in length. Size may vary slightly from pair to pair, but generally they will fit about the same.

20673,"The Globetrotter Pack. Waxed Canvas Backpack, for Hiking, Camping, Bushcraft, Travel bag, leather straps, water resistant, military style","
            We introduce you to The Globetrotter Pack.
This is a really big hand waxed canvas and leather backpack and is perfect for your bushcraft, hiking, camping or travel bag. The style is inspired in vintage military and camping bags. Olive green waxed cotton canvas, brown genuine cowhide leather straps and beige cotton waxed canvas lining. Holds an extra pair of shoes or boots in the front, and its side pockets can hold a big water bottle each. You can even take your laptop with you inside its padded laptop pocket.
This bag was designed with durability and versatility in mind. It's reinforced at every seam and all straps are double-secured with rivets.  Whether you are taking it for camping or as your weekender or travel bag, it will hold all your necessities - and even more!
Hand-waxed cotton canvas is water resistant and will repell dirt, so you only need a wipe to clean it. DO NOT MACHINE WASH IT OR TUMBLE-DRY. It will also age beautifully with a leather-like feeling.
