1354,"Antique Game Board. 1800s Telegraph Boy. McLoughlin Bros. Office, Game Room Wall Art. Victorian Parlor Game. Gift for College Grad, MBA.","
            Colorful antique game board that shows the way from Telegraph Boy to President of the company.  Move up in the ranks as you go around the board.  Landing on Ambition, Integrity or Promptness helps move you forward, but watch out because Loitering and Laziness will send you backwards. Personal fav is ""Stupidity"", which sends you back to ""Carelessness.""  Great office or game room decor, and a wonderful gift for the business school grad.
16 1/4"" x 17"".
The spinner is missing from the lower right corner. 
In nice vintage condition with light surface and edge wear. The wear is more apparent on the backside edges of the board, rather than the playing side. Bold orange, reds, golds and greens, with no apparent fading. Copyright 1888, McLoughlin Bros. The company, known for its chromolithographic artwork, was founded in 1858 and sold to Milton Bradley in 1920.

2214,Antique Chinese Grayish Green Twisted Rope Jade Bangle Bracelet - Natural Green Jade Bangle - Asian Antique Jade Collectibles,"
            Jade has had mystical significance since the Neolithic Age which began 10,000 years ago. Most sophisticated Neolithic settlements date to 3000 BC. Various cultures began to develop around the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. Settlements in the north were sparse, but appear to have had contact with both extreme northern peoples and with those in the southern areas around the areas of Xi'an and Anyang. Interesting similarities in bronze art extend from the northern Mongolian regions down into Yunnan. During the late Neolithic period the Yan people began to form a system culture. At the same time, the Han people were developing their culture around Anyang.
Chinese people believed jade had supernatural power. Using jade wares & jade ornaments could resist invasion of evil influence, avoid evil apparitions, secure safety & auspiciousness. 
Jade was highly regulated in ancient China. It is the second strongest mineral next to diamond and was once considered more valuable than gold.
Jade – a gemstone of unique symbolic energy, and unique in the myths that surround it and is thought to be calming to the nervous system, perfectly for calming the hot-tempered.
It also represents life and growth.

            Baby sweatshirts in organic cotton, baby clothes, baby tops
Beautifully soft organic cotton sweatshirts perfect for your new addition whether its a boy or a girl. This gorgeous sweatshirt is covered in cute hippu bear print and will look great with all your little ones outfits! Perfect for cold days and then warm evenings spent on the beach!
Handmade in super soft and excellent quality organic cotton sweatshirt fabric by Paapii and makes for a lovely extra layer. Because the fabric is not very thick, it is perfect for layering and keeping busy small people covered up but not hindered by a big bulky jumper.
POCKETS:
This sweatshirt also comes with the added bonus of lovely contrasting pockets. These pockets can be faux pockets if you prefer which is especially useful on the smaller sizes as they dont really need them the same and stone collecting toddlers 
All fabric has been pre-washed to make sure no more shrinking will occur. 
Washing instructions are as follows. Wash using a gentle machine cycle. Hang dry for best results, or machine dry on low.
