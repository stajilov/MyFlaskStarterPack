            This is an intricately sewn pillow cover with a panda bear eating bamboo design.  Each piece is sewn in separately.  I tried to get a photo of the inside.  Most all of this pillow cover is hand stitched including the back to the front side.  The zipper and seam were by machine.  The zippered back has a 5.5"" opening to be able to put in your own batting or pillow form.
I'm not sure what kind of material the back is - possibly some kind of heavier type cotton/rayon mix.  It's not silk.
It doesn't have a musty odor or offense smell (like from cigarette smoke)
This cover can also be used as a chair seat cushion or placed on the back of a chair or sofa or even as a miniature rug.

1990,Vintage Floats Set of 5 Fishing Floats Glass Floats Japanese Beach Decor Nautical Coastal Decor,"
            Vintage floats with nets add a fun coastal or nautical accent.  The set of 5 glass fishing floats were once used by Japanese fishermen on their squid nets.  The fishing floats measure about 2 to 2 1/2"" in diameter (larger than a golf ball, smaller than a tennis ball).  Each float has a ""button"" or pontil of melted glass at the bottom.  Glass fishing floats are a fun decorative accent in your coastal beach house or lake house decor.
This listing is for one set of 5 authentic vintage glass fishing floats and I have 4 sets.  Please specify quantity of sets at check out.
The vintage floats are pretty sea glass greenish- bluish shades and all floats have assorted nets.  We will select an assortment for you, or  please state any preferences at checkout in the notes section.
Condition:  The glass is in vintage condition with some patina, bubbles and salt residue. The netting is mostly intact, with wear from bobbing in the ocean.  Some are marked Japan or with Japanese characters.

            This classic hobnail milk glass vase was made by Fenton throughout the 1950s and '60s.  This size is great for medium-sized flower arrangements, and especially good for wedding centerpieces or your dining table.  Double crimped rim.  
Measures just under 6 inches high, about 5 inches across diameter of mouth.  Unmarked. 
Overall condition is very good, with no chips, cracks or repairs.  Minor variations in the color and molding of the glass.  
I often have multiples of this vase--the molding of the rim may vary slightly, but the condition will be good for all.  You can select the quantity you would like at the top right of this page.  If you would like additional images, please let me know. 
This listing is for *one* vase--the medium size in the last image.  The smaller and larger vases are shown for scale.  For other milk glass in my shop, click here:

9848,"Made in the USA - iPad Pro Sleeve with Apple Pencil Pocket - Charcoal Felt for 9.7"" iPad Pro, 12.9"" iPad Pro or iPad Air, Made in the USA","
            Find this same sleeve in Grey (lighter) here: 
www.etsy.com/listing/273888758
A new design for the iPad Pro with Apple Pencil users in mind. Now available for the new 9.7"" iPad Pro and the 12.9"" iPad Pro. 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
TEN NOTES ABOUT THIS NEW DESIGN::
ONE:  Made of 100% Wool felted in Germany. This is the good stuff. We choose this felt specifically over the other German felts as it has a smoother, tighter surface and higher density which makes for more solid stitching. Two full body pieces plus a third that forms the pocket on the front... that's 9mm of felt to protect your goods. Our felt is hand selected for us to ensure we are supplied a consistent color & texture.
TWO:  Our stitching is heavy-duty bonded nylon by American & Effird and we are very specific about stitch length, placement and reinforcement. The reinforced 'starts and stops' (referred to as backtacking) and carefully designed corner details carry throughout our line. We keep the space between the stitches and edge of the felt tight to further minimize profile and create a cleaner look that will maintain with use.
THREE: We've been building felt sleeves since before there was an iPad and our goal has always been to provide sleeves that fit. As the devices have evolved with the additions of Smart Covers, Smart Keyboards, Silicone Cases we've opened up our sizing to accommodate. Beyond looking at sizes, we also pay attention to materiality of these accessories and how that affects your use of the sleeve. Those sleeves sized to accommodate Smart Covers/Keyboards and/or Silicone Cases are slightly oversized to allow for those items to slide in and out easily but sized still close enough to feel tailored and that your device is secure. See HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR SIZE below for the different sizes available. 
FOUR: Need more security that just a perfect fit? We get it. We love this sleeve and feel comfortable with the open end but if you really want it, we can add leather strap to the opening similar to our other designs. Cost is an extra 20 and you can choose between brown or black leather we cut from hides we have custom finished for us by Wickett & Craig Tannery in Pennsylvania. Contact us to set-up a custom order. Adding a strap is suggested for those users who plan to purchase sleeves to accommodate covers or cases but also want the flexibility of sometimes leaving those covers off. The strap will keep everything in place regardless of contents.
FIVE: Let's talk about the Apple Pencil pocket. This pocket structure was designed with Apple Pencil users in mind. First, the width of the Apple Pencil pocket is designed to allow you to reach in with your thumb and forefinger to grab the Pencil. If you been using the Apple Pencil, you know that the end of the Pencil comes off easily so you need to be able reach deeper, beyond the end to pull it out. The slanted pocket design is intentional as it gives you variable depth and the ability to choose how low you tuck your Pencil if you want it fully concealed below the lip of the pocket.
SIX:  The second pocket offers a little extra storage best suited for flat/thin items: cords, earbuds, notebooks. On the 9.7"" iPad Pro, this pocket is about 4.5"" wide. On the 12.9"" iPad Pro, this pocket is 6.5"" wide or more and some 12.9"" users have found they can use this pocket to tuck in their thin, wireless keyboards such as Logitech's Keys-To-Go.  This pocket will not fit Apple's Magic Keyboard but if you want a sleeve for that, we have one coming soon. For your reference, the notebook shown in this pocket is a standard size FEILD NOTES notebook.
SEVEN: Need a spot for your iPad Pro charger? Check out our Small Storage Accessories. The Small Dumpling is perfect for your iPad Pro charger: 
www.etsy.com/listing/267155414/wooly-dumplings
EIGHT:  Every byrd & belle product is made in small batches (and sometimes one at a time) in our studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota. You can find more information on who makes your items and see photos of where they are made: 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/byrdandbelle/about
NINE:  Our studio maintains a low-impact initiative where we balance the quality of our materials with our environmental impact. We choose felt as our main material because beyond its beauty and its addictive texture, it is a rapidly renewable resource, fully biodegradable, LEED recognized and Oeko-Tex certified. Choosing to have your device case made out of felt rather than other materials such as canvas means you've chosen a natural material that acts as exterior material, interior lining and padding in one, eliminating multiple sourcing routes and petroleum-based foam. Our only wish is that someone in the USA would manufacture this material but for now, we'll stick with the Germans as they have a higher level of workplace standards & equality than other countries we've seen supplying felt. It costs a little more. It's worth it.
TEN:  We want your experience with our studio to be a good one. Beyond our return policy, we are here over the life span of this item. The need for repairs is rare, but we make them and usually for free. If you upgrade to a thinner/smaller device, we might be able to modify your sleeve/case to suit or make it into something else entirely. Our materials are chosen to last and often times outlast your device. Let's figure out a way to keep it in use.
