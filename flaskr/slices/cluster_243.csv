6381,Deer antler dog chews-free shipping!,"
            This listing is for a deer antler dog chew. Extra Large will be between 7""-9"" in length but forked antlers may be up to 13"" long. Large will be between 6""-8"" in length, medium will be between 5""-7"" in length and small will be between 4""-6"" in length. The antlers may be straight or forked. Deer antlers are typically harder than elk antlers, this makes them a great choice for very aggressive chewers. Elk antlers are more ""porous"", while deer are very dense. Both are a great choice, you just need to be aware that if your dog needs a softer chew, deer are probably not the right fit. Elk can be hard or soft depending on the location on the antler it was cut from, which is why we give you the choice of core density on elk, but not deer. Elk antlers are bigger than deer antlers. This limits the size we can cut from a deer so a large elk is bigger than a large deer. They are priced to reflect this. Note: The photos shown are stock photos and you will receive a similar item. Please keep in mind that antlers are unique in shape and appearance. 
We believe that every dog should unleash their wild instincts and enjoy a piece of 100% naturally shed deer or elk antler. Many wild animals chew on antlers as a source of nutrients. Every year deer and elk shed their antlers so that they can regrow new ones for the next year. They shed them, we pick them up, you give them to your best friend.  Each antler is washed with water to get rid of any dirt, next we make specific cuts to meet your dog’s needs. We also take the time to smooth down all the edges for safe chewing.
Some of the benefits to giving your dog this natural treat are:
	100% natural- no additives, no coloring, no GMO, no chemicals
	No colors to stain your carpet
	Long lasting, which is a plus for those dogs that love to chew
	Healthy- rich source of essential minerals and nutrients
	No animals were harmed to get this great treat. These antlers were                     shed by 100% free-ranging wild animals from Nevada and Idaho.
Satisfaction Guaranteed!!
It is very important to us that you get the best customer service because we appreciate you as a customer. We encourage you to message us with information about your dog (type, size, etc.) or any specific cuts you might have in mind for your dog, We realize that each pet is different and has different tastes, and we would love to cater to their needs so that they can get a bone that was made just for them! Returns can only be accepted on chews in new condition.
				      *A safe reminder*  
Please keep an eye on your dog when they chew antlers. Dogs can sometimes get very excited with a new treat and can get carried away and over stimulated by it. If this happens just take it away for a bit and let them calm down. When they do eventually chew it down to a size small enough to be swallowed please remove it and discard it. We are not responsible for any harm or damage, but we also do not want anything bad to happen to our friends!

BIOLOGY
Passiflora edulis  is native to Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina.The passion fruit is round to oval, either yellow or dark purple at maturity, with a soft to firm, juicy interior filled with numerous seeds. Passion fruit, or Maracuja, is very popular in Brazil and primarily used for food, in the form of juices, jams, jellies, ice cream and liqueurs. Maracuja Cipirinhas are almost as popular as the original lime one. The leaves and juice contain passiflorin, a natural sedative, used to lower blood pressure and against anxiety, and tea prepared with leaves has a diuretic effect. The oil is extracted from the seeds, has a high content of unsaturated fats and lots of vitamin A and C. 
My oils and butters are are wild harvested, grown naturally in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest without any pesticides, they are fair traded and sustainable resources.

8299,Perfect Pits All Natural Deodorant - Aluminum Free,"
            Let's face it; we all need it! But what we don't need are all of the unnecessary ingredients, like ALUMINUM! 
This sweet smelling deodorant doesn't contain any of the nasty stuff, but instead, coconut oil, baking soda, shea butter, Arrow Root, and essential oils, and in some cases, minimal fragrance oils. It's so soothing to the skin that it will work as a moisturizer and keep you smelling fresh at the same time! 
Available in :
- Citrus Fresh
- Jasmine
- Lavender
- Sandalwood
**NOTE**  The Patchouli and Sandalwood scents contain darker oils that may cause the deodorant to turn a darker color with time, which in turn, may make armpits turn a darker color as well. Please know that there is nothing I can do about this; it just happens. Refunds will not be given for dark armpits. ;) 
AND ... The Unscented deodorant still contains a bit of Tea Tree oil for fighting bacteria that causes odors so you may smell a hint of it in your Unscented deodorant. 
2 oz. twist-up
Teenage boy tested, Mother approved! 
A few TIPS for switching to natural deodorant ... Some adjustment is required. 
- A little goes a long way! It's a lot softer than store-bought deodorant so dabbing it on is recommended. 
- Since it is different from the chemical commercial deodorants you're use to so give your body a week or so to detox and adapt. You've been using aluminum and paraben-packed deodorants for years. It's in your pores, and it needs to seep out. This too shall pass. 
- Wait an hour before applying to freshly shaved or waxed armpits as that is pretty sensitive skin and is ""open"" right after shaving.

The Wild Abandon headband is made for movement. Whether taking your favorite spin or yoga class, running the distance or out on the town, this headband will stay put and comfortable while you're on the move. Go girl.

Because its made of Nylon/Lycra, its light weight, washable and holds its own against a sweat sesh. As a marathoner, outdoors lover and fitness enthusiest I know it's a must! The stretchy and seamless 3.5 inch wide band is tapered in the back and will mold to your head. Uncompromised comfort!
{ How to Rock It }
For the best and most secure fit, wear this headband mid-way down your forehead!
{ About True North }
I am a creative soul who prefers to be in motion. With 8 years of buying experience in the action sports industry, I understand the importance of fashion AND function. As a 4x marathoner and fitness devotee, I had an overflowing 'headband drawer' but none I really liked. While driving home from a workout with my husband, wearing a stretched out loose headband, I said, ""I'm going to make a headband that I will actually LOVE"". Fast forward to fabric shopping, QT with my sewing machine and 'field testing' by family and friends and True North Collection became a reality. My wish is that True North's mix of California-boho style  functional fitness headbands will become your new favorite as well!        ",7.00,4.8237,"Handmade item

            NATURAL SUNSCREEN LOTION (4oz)
A completely healthy alternative!
Great for sensitive skin!!
Handmade in Pennsylvania
No harsh chemicals
No artificial fragrances
Each jar is made with Raw Shea Butter and coconut oil to give it an extra nurturing quality.   Coconut oil and shea butter have a natural low spf and help to shield your skin from the sun. Carrot seed and Myrrh essential oils are also added to increase the SPF and help protect your skin from sun damage. 
I make this with OR without the addition of non-nano zinc oxide.  I only use Non-Nano zinc oxide, because nano zinc oxide is known to pass into the skin cells, where zinc oxide remains on the surface until it is washed off.  Though you can see the whiteness of the non-nano zinc oxide, it will ""rub in"" after a few seconds to give you a clear finish.
<<I am not claiming a specific SPF level since my sunscreen has not been lab tested and it would be against FDA laws to do so.   You will need to reapply and be aware of your skin type. 
INGREDIENTS: Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Carrot Seed and Myrrh essential oils, non-nano zinc oxide (optional)

1) WITH NON-NANO ZINC OXIDE: multiple studies show that it remains on the surface level of the skin and is not able to be soaked in. This greatly increases the SPF of the sunscreen.
2) EXTRA MYRRH/NO ZINC OXIDE: This gives you a slightly lower SPF than the Non-Nano Zinc Oxide version.  It is just a bit more costly due to the nature of pure essential oils. If you're one who is on the fence about or even against the use of any kind of zinc oxide, then this is a great option. 
3) JUST OILS: SPF level achieved purely with shea butter, coconut, and essential oils. Obviously if you are fair and sit out in the blazing sun with this you will burn! But I am fair and can wear this on a regular day going in and out of the sun and it is a great option to help to protect my skin.
RE-APPLY every few hours and after being in water! I will not be held responsible for misuse of products.

This is for all of you who have been asking, ""Do you have an exfoliating bar?""  Now I do.
The Exfoliator is loaded with colloidal oatmeal, black poppy seeds and apricot kernel seed meal, this bar delivers nothing short of a vigorous scrub.  Whether you’re looking for a stimulating shower experience or something to scrub those stubborn heels and elbows, I think you'll find that this fits the bill.  I would recommend this for a body bar only, as it's my opinion that it would be too rough on your face.  However, this is only my opinion. 
I have added a generous portion of avocado oil to this recipe.  This oil is readily absorbed into the skin, is packed with vitamins A, B, C, D and E and promotes collagen production.  I have also added  a heap of cocoa butter to moisturize and give this bar a decadent, creamy lather.
SOAP QUICK FACTS:
Weight: 4.5 oz. – 5 oz.
Dimensions: 3.5”x2.75”x1”
Unscented: No essential oils or fragrance oils added
INGREDIENT QUICK FACTS:
Palm Oil : Organic RSPO Sustainable
Canola Oil: Non GMO
Jojoba: Pesticide Free
Ingredients: Coconut oil, palm oil, lye, olive oil, rice bran, avocado oil, colloidal oatmeal, canola oil, castor oil, black poppy seeds, apricot kernel seed meal, cocoa butter
In the spirit of working with nature, I use the traditional cold process method in the creation of all of my soaps. I like to think that my soaps are guided by human hand, but made by nature.
PLEASE NOTE: Handmade soap will last a long time if kept dry between uses. Please use a draining soap dish and keep it away from direct streams of water.
NOTE: The images are for reference only.  Products are made by hand using natural ingredients.  Please allow for color differences in your finished products.        ",7.00,4.9673,"Handmade item

9165,Small mole ornament waldorf toy nature table miniature mole MOL1,"
            This little grey mole is fun to adorn your waldorf nature table with. He stands about 1-1/2"" (4 cm) tall and is made from wood, cotton knit fabric with embroidered ears. He is hand sewn and has a sweet disposition. Perfect to tuck into little spaces or peek out of a basket. His face is hand drawn with permanent ink onto the cotton knit skin which covers the wood base of his head. He will hold up to gentle play but too much love may damage to skin of his pointy little nose. 
 Warning choking hazard

13969,Thick Textured Dishcloth Weaving Pattern for Rigid Heddle Loom,"
            It couldn't be easier and the results are beautiful! You will enjoy weaving these wonderful little dishcloths on your rigid heddle loom using worsted weight cotton yarn and size 3 cotton crochet thread. The thirsty textured pattern of the cloth is woven using a simple ""pick-up stick"" technique that will take you beyond the simple tabby weave....and inspire you to experiment with other textures and color patterns once you see how easy it is!
You will need a rigid heddle loom with a 10"" weaving width, an 8-dent heddle, and a 12"" long pick-up stick (or a ruler can be used) to weave these cloths. I use common ""Sugar and Cream"" yarn from my local Walmart which can be purchased in cones or smaller skeins. Size 3 crochet cotton is also readily available in many colors at your local craft store. 
This pattern is sold as a PDF file which will be immediately available for download after checkout. You can then open the file using Adobe Acrobat and print the pattern on your home printer. 

Please note that this pattern is copyright protected and may only be used for the purchaser's personal weaving. You may not make items from this pattern in order to sell for profit in any venue.

Because these rings are made to order there will be slight variations. But each ring will always be of the highest quality materials and workmanship.
These rings will hold their shape very well if care is taken when worn. 
The wire used for these rings is considered ""non-tarnish"", but like anything it will eventually show signs of wear. 
To keep the rings at their best it is recommended that you avoid wearing the them while engaged in activities such as sports, swimming, doing dishes or showering.
If you would like wear it daily, I highly recommend the 925 STERLING SILVER or 14K GOLD FILLED wave rings, they got higher quality and more beautiful metallic luster, you won't regret to choose that!
All wave rings come in a gift box to protect them during shipment and ready to be a gift! 
This will ensure your rings will arrive undamaged and ready to wear. 
If you have any questions please feel free to contact me, I would love to hear from you.

*an earring equal to or less than the price of the least expensive earring purchased. 
.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo.
~~~ The Earrings ~~~
THEY COME IN SINGLE UNITS (ideal for helix piercings) so if you're getting them as lobe earrings you should probably get two... that or mix-and-match them!
~~~ The Moon! ~~~
This teeny sterling silver moon is 5mm X 6mm and is so dainty I could just about DIE. This would be amazing as just about any kind of earring or nose post. 
I am seriously contemplating adding an option to get this as a nose bone as well because it would look so perfect that way. 
~~~ THE OPTIONS ~~~
- The Regular-type (20 gauge) earring post is ~10mm long and is surgical steel. This is a wire post and comes with bullet style silicone backs (message me if you prefer non-hypoallergenic metal backs). Perfect for lobe piercings. 
- The  18 Gauge S.Steel Post. It is internally threaded surgical steel. It has a flat, labret-style back.
- The 16 Gauge S.Steel Post is internally threaded surgical steel. This has a flat, labret-style back.
- The 16 Gauge Bioflex Post is 8mm (or 5/16"") long. This has a flat, Labret back.
- The 14 Gauge S.Steel Post is internally threaded surgical steel. It comes in 8mm length with a flat labret-style back.

Because these rings are made to order there will be slight variations. But each ring will always be of the highest quality materials and workmanship.
These rings will hold their shape very well if care is taken when worn. 
The wire used for these rings is considered ""non-tarnish"", but like anything it will eventually show signs of wear. 
To keep the rings at their best it is recommended that you avoid wearing the them while engaged in activities such as sports, swimming, doing dishes or showering.
If you would like wear it for a long time, I highly recommend the STERLING SILVER or GOLD FILLED or ROSE GOLD RILLED wave rings, they got higher quality and more beautiful metallic luster, you won't regret to choose that!
All wave rings come in a gift box to protect them during shipment. 
This will ensure your rings will arrive undamaged and ready to wear. 
If you have any questions please feel free to contact me, I would love to hear from you.

18276,16g Anodized Twister Cartilage Rings,"
            16g Anodized Twister Cartilage Rings.  They are used to run through several piercing holes on the ear.  Can also be used for other piercings such as Belly Navel.  
Anodizing is an electrochemical process that converts the metal surface into a decorative, durable, corrosion-resistant, anodic oxide finish. 
I have seen them used, and it is definitely a really cool affect.  It is like you have a spring running through your ear.
Any questions, feel free to message me.  I will answer as soon as possible.

We created this {Pine Tree Inspired} headband to fulfill all your fitness hair hopes and dreams. Whether you are running, spinning, hiking, or yoga-ing this headband will STAY PUT.  Whatever activity you enjoy most we have created the perfect no-fuss, no–muss headband for you! 
*what's it MADE of*
Fit NorthWest headbands are made from quality spandex material that we have specifically selected and tested ourselves to make sure it stays put and is comfortable throughout your whole workout. Each headband is a unique, handmade item so the pattern may differ slightly from the one pictured. To prolong life of headband, hand-wash only.
*how does it FIT*
Fit NorthWest headbands are created from a stretchy spandex material so they comfortably fit all size noggins. We suggest you wear our headbands as shown in display picture above-about an inch above your eyebrows. If you are interested in children's sizes we can do that too! Just send us a message.
*about FIT NORTHWEST*
We are Erica and Emily. Sisters born and raised in the Pacific Northwest; former collegiate athletes, late-night crafting buddies, and weekend outdoor adventurers. We tried for years to find that elusive perfect-fitting headband. Our search too often left us wondering, “Why do these things always slip off? Do I have a weird shaped head?!” {Don’t worry we’ve all thought it at one point or another}. We kept coming up empty so one night after we finished up at our local gym we decided to take matters into our own hands and Fit NorthWest was born.
