1367,Vintage Crisloid Dice Display - Bakelite Dice Display - Lucky Dice New Old Stock,"
            This is an awesome piece of New Old Stock!!  The cardboard display measures 10.5 inches in width and just over 8.5 inches in length.  The board reads ""Crisloid - Top Grade Dice"" and has a blank white circle that has the cents sign and reads ""Pair"".  The graphics on this are great!  The cardboard is nice and straight with no creases.  There are 20 pairs of miniature dice (measuring .325 inch square).  Each pair is in its individual plastic bag and stapled to the grid.  The tops of the grids read "" Easy Money - Acey-Ducey - Easy Aces - Lucky Dice - Parcheesi - Backammon"".  Some of the staples have some rust on them - but not greatly noticeable.  This find would be great to add to a general store collection!

5876,"Handmade Needle Floral Lace Collar Set, c. 1920","
            Finely executedneedle lace collar and neck piece were meant to spruce up a contrasting color dress for the 1920's woman who made this.  Flowers, leaves and vines with what appear to be grapes draw the eye to the lovely neck of the wearer.  More importantly, point the eyes toward her feminine assets without really revealing too much.
Neck piece measures 12"" by 3"".  I am sure it is meant to be worn the other way around from what I have pictured, but then how would you see the beautiful center rose?    The two collar or lapel pieces measure 9"" long and 4"" at the widest part of the lapel or collar.  Very good to excellent condition. Laundered and pressed.
Ready to use and draw attention to your fine workmanship with their fine workmanship!        ",16.00,4.9816,"Vintage item from the 1920s

9080,Vintage Zig Zag Comic Express Tin Lithograph and Plastic Train - Wind Up Tin Train,"
            This toy measures 11.25 inches in length, 2.125 inches in height and 2 inches in width (wheels included).  The engine is made of plastic and the cars are tin lithographed.  The train is in good shape and has its key.  When wound up it does move which also makes the plastic little bell ring!  One side of the train reads ""Zig-zag Comic Express"" and the other reads ""Western Comic Zig-zag"".  There are a few minor spots of paint wear on the tin cars. The engine has read wheels that appear a bit discolored. The bottom of the engine reads ""Made in China"".  This train is vintage and could use a good cleaning.  The tops of the tin cars seem dirty but it does not clean off.  Please look closely at the pictures!
