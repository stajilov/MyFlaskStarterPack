816,Vintage 1970s Early Laurel Burch Cloisonné Enamel Antique Chinese Beads Pierced Earrings Sterling Silver 24k  Gold Wash,"
            These vintage 1970s early Laurel Burch cloisonné enamel pierced earrings feature round Antique Chinese Beads with the Shou longevity and happiness symbols and tube-shaped beads in a 24k gold wash vermeil sterling silver setting.  The enamel colors are Turquoise, Cobalt, Hyacinth, Light Amethyst and Hyacinth.  I think the beads are antique, but don't know for sure.  
The earrings are not marked (or possibly they are marked on the ear wires and I simply do not see it) and measure approximately 1 1/2"" in length by 1/2"" in width.  
There is minor tarnish of the metal. There are tiny chips in the enamel beads which are noticed under magnification.  These earrings are in great condition and are a wonderful treasure to add to any collection. 
Thank you for viewing my offerings!
NOTE: I am offering pieces of my extensive early Laurel Burch collection.  I have discovered there are unscrupulous sellers offering items as ""early Laurel Burch"" that are, in fact, not.   Chinese pieces made prior to Laurel Burch's partnership were made with the same materials, and quite possibly by the same artisan.  For one to label all Chinese pieces as Laurel Burch is misleading and dishonest.  Collectors please beware!  
Below is helpful information from Laurel's catalog on caring for these treasures.  I used the recommended Tarn-x for cleaning tarnish and it worked extremely well.  I used Tarn-x on a Q-Tip and dabbed it gently on the front and back side of a brooch, rinsed in warm water, and repeated this process several times.  The piece looked brand new!  I hope you find it useful, too.
TAKING CARE OF YOUR EARRINGS
Laurel, Inc. enamel earrings are an exciting blend of contemporary style and far eastern craft.  Each earring is hand enameled on vermeil, in China, using techniques unique to that country.
As each piece is hand worked, there will sometimes be slight differences in coloration. These should not be viewed as imperfections but rather as your assurance of their individuality.
We offer the following suggestions for the care of Laurel, Inc. earrings.
The enamel itself is a thin layer of glass on the surface of the earring. It should be treated very gently and never bent as that could lead to its cracking or shattering.
Fixed earwires and posts are soldered to the earring. The juncture itself must never be bent as this could cause the earwire to separate from the earring. If adjustment must be made, always be sure to support the top of the wire while bending the end portion.
Those earwires which are an actual part of the earring design should be adjusted, if necessary, by moving the wire from side to side. They should never be moved up and down as this could loosen the solder.
Earwires that are hinged are designed to allow enough movement for easy insertion into the ear. The hinge should never be forced. 
As silver is a relatively soft metal excessive manipulation and adjustment should be avoided.
To clean the earrings (both silver and vermeil) we recommend using a silver cleaning solution, such as Tarn-x. The earring should be first quickly dipped in the solution. It should then be carefully washed in warm water and mild detergent to remove any residue of the dip. If a piece is badly tarnished this procedure should be repeated. Dry gently and your earring will be good as new. We do not recommend the use of rough cloths for cleaning vermeil.        ",150.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1970s

            I really wasn't sure what to make of this sweater when I first brought it home, but the more I look it over, the more cool stuff I discover about it.

Truly a unique piece.

4975,Beautiful French antique Baccarat 7 pc vanity set cranberry color,"
            SALE Lovely large set original Baccarat 7 pc crystal vanity set in beautiful cranberry color. Three perfum bottles with original cut crystal stoppers and one with a perfum atomizer. The powder compact still has its wonderfull soft and fluffy cotton puff inside. Baccarat crystal is highly collectable. It was established by Ling Louis XV around 1765 to compete with imported Bohemian crystal. 
I bought it from an old Parisienne neighbour who's moving to a smaller house and organised a 'vide maison'. Her grandmother got the set as a present from her husband around 1910 in Paris.
Vanity sets like this one are quite rare and so beautifull! It is in general good vintage condition, but has some chips off here and there, one stopper has been repaired (though hardly viasable when it is on the bottle), apart from that the stoppers are perfect. The powder compact has been glued (see photo's).

Size small tray (lenght x width): 11 x 8,5 cm or 4.3"" x 3.4""

Hight perfum bottles: 21 (bottle with atomizer) & 19 & 17(2) cm high or 8.3"" & 7.5"" & 6.9""
Weight (total): 1800 gr or  63.5 oz
Check for other items in my store, no additional shipping cost up to 5 kg. Please contact me if you have any questions or if you would like a combination of items.

5384,Original Oil Painting/Original Oil Portrait/Arts and Crafts Frame,"
            Found at an estate sale, this original oil painting  on canvas panel has an intriquing, mysterious quality that allows for a wide latitude in perspective and interpretation. Signed lower right M Hall for artist Marlene Hall, this portrait of a bearded man exhibits quick brushstrokes in a palette of raw umber, crimson, black and green. I liked the theme of duality as expressed in the choice to reveal but one side of his face.
Much later on, I found this vintage arts and crafts frame to complement the mood of the portrait. The gold painted lip of the frame acts as a fillet, punctuating the rectangular dimension of the panel. The period arts and crafts moulding appears to be constructed of two pieces but is actually one piece, adding more visual detail and interest. Finished in a glass bottle-green tone and a burnished gold not unlike the mellowed patina of a period brass candlestick, the frame is crafted with a wavy design and a scored texture. While the two styles are disparate, I believe the pair create a unique visual union.
Minor knicks to moulding. In as found condition.

10543,"Handmade Wood Headphone Stand, The Classic, Oak, Unique Tech/Audiophile Gift, Headphone Holder, Headset Stand, Headset Holder","
            The Classic is my original wooden headphone stand design. It’s simple and solidly built. I designed this for use in my office because I was tired of having my headphones laying all over my desk and the cord (all 30 feet of it) getting tangled with everything. Now I have a dedicated place where my headphones chill when not in use. 
This handmade stand is built from solid oak. The base is about 5"" wide by 10"" deep. The arm is about 11 1/2"" tall and 8 3/4"" long. There’s roughly 10 1/4"" of hanging space available from the bottom of the arm to the top of the base plate. This design can easily hold two pair of headphones. It’s been finished with several coats of oil creating a warm and natural look. 
This stand makes a great gift for the techie or audiophile in your life. Music is such a big part of so many lives and with a stand you’ll help protect the investment made in each pair of headphones that hang from it.
This item ships disassembled (it's much cheaper to ship this way). The arm is held to the base with two screws (which are included). All you need to do is apply a minimal amount of elbow grease and your headphones will be hanging in no time.
Like what you see but need something just a little different? Send me a message and I’ll put together a custom order just for you.

            The radio works.  It gets louder as it warms up. It has that old AM radio sound.
The turntable turns slowly and gains speed the longer it is on, but doesn't transmit sound from the record.  There is sound from the turntable when it is on.  It may be the needle cartridge.  We don't know enough about them to help you much.  
The cabinet looks good.  If you are picky about finish, you would probably want to refinish it.  If you like old for old's sake, you will be happy with it as is.

15712,Copper Alembic Still 1.5 Liter for Home Gardens,"
            Handcrafted in Southern Europe and a traditional tool used for 100's of years to make hydrosols, also known as floral waters, and essential oils. Rosewater and witch hazel are the two floral waters most people are familiar with. Fresh flowers from your garden (or farmers' market) can be used or dried botanicals including spices. These floral waters and essential oils can be used in misters, aftershaves, lotions, creams and soaps.
Tradition and beauty aren't he only reasons for making a still from copper. It also conducts heat well, improves scent and reduces bacterial contamination. The handles are brass.  The solder used meets federal safety standards. An electric or gas heat source can be used to heat the pot portion of the still. The condenser has 3 outlets, which gives you the option of cooling the condenser with ice or circulating cool water with a hose. The 1.5L still measures 12"" length x 10"" tall x 6"" deep.
This is one of the simplest types of stills to use and set up. We use this style at the Elfin Herb Farm. Instructions are included to get you started in the ancient craft of distilling the ""souls of flowers"".
