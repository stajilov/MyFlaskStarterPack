11149,"Conflict Free Engagement Ring - Forever One G-H-I Moissanite and Recycled 950 Palladium, Matte/Brushed, Simple Solitaire, Made to Order","
            This gorgeous sparkler features a Forever One G-H-I moissanite (6mm; equivalent to a 0.75 carat diamond) set in a handmade tapered bezel on a 2mm wide x 1.5mm thick square edged band with a matte, brushed finish. All of the metal used in the construction of this ring is 950 palladium from recycled sources.
950 palladium is 95% pure palladium (palladium is a noble metal in the platinum family). It is hypoallergenic (nickel free), and boasts a wonderful permanent bright-white color (much whiter than white gold) that does not require rhodium plating.
You can view a short video of this ring at https://www.flickr.com/photos/7951878@N07/25867789420/
Please allow three to four weeks for fabrication of your custom made ring.
Moissanite was originally born from a meteorite over 50,000 years ago, and was first discovered by Dr. Henri Moissan in 1893 in material collected from a meteor crater in Arizona. These incredibly brilliant sparkling crystals might have been considered ""diamonds from space,"" but Dr. Moissan's research actually identified them as a new mineral find - silcon carbide, whose chemical composition is SiC (diamonds are made from carbon). This stunning jewel is extremely rare, and almost impossible to find in nature. So rare, in fact, that the dream of using it in jewelry was an impossibility until man discovered a way to create and craft these incredible silicon carbide crystals here on Earth.
With more fire than any popular gemstone (including diamond), no other stone or jewel compares to Moissanite. In fact, fire can be measured scientifically and moissanite has nearly 2.4 times the fire of diamond. Moissanite also has 10% more brilliance and luster than diamond. Proven to be harder than ruby, sapphire or emerald and second only to diamond, moissanite is also extraordinarily heat resistant, durable, and tough. It is extremely resistant to scratching, abrasion, breaking and chipping. And because these phenomenal stones are grown in a laboratory, you don't have to worry about the ethical problems involved with harvesting diamonds and other mined gems.
This design uses a Forever One G-H-I stone. Moissanite comes in two varieties - Forever One G-H-I and Forever One D-E-F (with the letter grades corresponding to traditional diamond color grading) - if you'd like a quote for this design with a Forever One D-E-F moissanite, please contact me for a quote.
If you would like to make two payments (50% now and 50% upon completion), please note your preference in the 'notes to seller' field and select 'other' as your payment method. Once I receive your order I will send a Paypal money request for half the total, or you can call me to process the partial payment on your credit card over the phone.

SHIPPING INFORMATION
-----------------------------------
If you live in the United States and your order total is below 2,000, default shipping is via USPS Priority Mail (insured). If your order total is above 2,000, complimentary FedEx 2-Day delivery is included (also insured). If you prefer a different shipping method, please ask.
I do offer international shipping; because the US postal service will not insure jewelry items shipped internationally, I use FedEx International when shipping outside the US; this is a more expensive but far safer option. The price listed here for international shipping is an ESTIMATE ONLY - actual shipping costs could vary by up to 40 over or under the amount listed. If you would like an exact quote for shipping, please contact me prior to checkout; otherwise, I will contact you soon after checkout with an EXACT shipping quote and we will make arrangements at that point for a refund or additional payment. International buyers, please be aware that you are solely responsible for any duties/taxes that your country may charge on imported goods (this amount is NOT included in the shipping cost due here, but is paid separately upon receipt of goods). Please do not ask me to lie on the customs form; it's against the law! I can also provide an estimate for duties/taxes upon request.

A LITTLE ABOUT ME AND MY SHOP

I am an eco-freak! Wherever I possibly can, I make decisions that support the health of the environment, as well as the people and other animals that inhabit our earth.
I use recycled office supplies and shipping materials whenever possible. My studio electricity is generated from solar panels on our garage roof. I purchase carbon offsets for shipping. And of course my designs incorporate only recycled metals and ethically sourced stones. Please visit my 'About' page here on Etsy for more info!
