10864,Vintage Polaroid OneStep SX-70 White Rainbow Stripe Instant Camera with 1 Pack of New Impossible Project Color Film - Tested & Working,"
            Tested and Working Vintage Polaroid OneStep SX-70 White Rainbow Stripe Instant Film Camera with 1 Pack of New Impossible Project Color SX-70 Film
ABOUT THE CAMERA: This is the iconic Polaroid SX-70 OneStep camera that helped to inspire Instagram. In fact, Instagram’s App logo is a direct play on this vintage camera.
This little camera is both highly collectible and usable. It was one of the first instant film cameras designed and produced by Polaroid in their now highly familiar ""box"" type format. It was first released in the mid 1970’s.
The camera shoots original Polaroid SX-70 integrated instant film as well as compatible film now being manufactured by the good folks at The Impossible Project (TIP). The pictures produced are all one of a kind, vintage style, self-developing photos in the classic square format with the white border that everyone immediately knows as a “Polaroid”.
SX-70 was the original Polaroid integrated instant film format, and precursor to Polaroid 600 film. It was considered a groundbreaking achievement in its day. The more modern Polaroid 600 film is the most popular instant film format of all time. SX-70 and 600 film formats are identical in all regards accept for their light sensitivity. SX-70 film is roughly 125 ASA, while 600 films is roughly 680 ASA. It is even possible to use 600 format film in SX-70 cameras in combination with a neutral density (ND) filter.
PLEASE NOTE this camera does NOT include a built-in flash. A flash is an absolute necessity when taking indoor photos with this camera and film format. Without a flash, indoor photos will come out very dark and/or blurry.
Old disposable flash bars and vintage battery-powered flash units are available in my Etsy store. TIP themselves have also released a highly efficient brand new flash unit that is optimized for their film. The TIP flashbar is available for order via their website.
CONDITION: Used vintage camera
COSMETIC CONDITION: This is a used Polaroid camera in good to very good cosmetic condition for its age. The camera is complete with intact rubber eyecup and neck strap.
Please keep in mind that this camera is nearly 40 years old, and will show signs of prior use. Common wear includes, but is not limited to, wear to the silver paint around the lens and shutter button and scratches, chips, and swirl marks on the body of the camera. This is not a new camera, and should not be expected to look as new.
FUNCTIONALITY: The camera has been inspected, cleaned, lubricated, and tested for functionality. The camera is working well.
After an initial test for functionality, the camera received a thorough internal and external cleaning, and lubrication of moving parts. The camera was then more fully tested using a film pack with working battery and loaded with a few previously exposed photos. The camera successfully loaded the film pack and ejected the cover slide. Pushing the red shutter button successfully fired a shot, ejected the photo through the rollers, and advanced everything for the next shot without issue. Mechanically, the camera passed all of my testing.
I attached an external battery-powered electronic flash unit (not included) to the flash shoe to test the connection. The camera properly triggered the external flash unit.
Given the high cost of virgin Polaroid SX-70 and Impossible Project film, I have not taken any actual photos with this camera. The optics appear to be in excellent condition upon cleaning and inspection.
ABOUT THE FILM: Polaroid stopped producing film for these cameras in 2008. A group of investors and former Polaroid employees quickly organized as The Impossible Project (TIP) shortly thereafter. TIP bought Polaroid’s last factory and production equipment in Enschede, The Netherlands, and began producing new instant film in 2010. 
While TIP procured Polaroid's old equipment, they had to completely re-engineer the film itself from scratch. The film is a constant work in progress. Improvements are made with each batch of production. 
The film included here is TIP’s latest, and greatest film yet. It was manufactured in mid 2016.
ITEM PHOTOS: The photos shown here represent a sample of what I have available. All cameras available are in similar cosmetic condition. There will be variations from camera to camera.
WHAT IS INCLUDED:
-Vintage Polaroid OneStep SX-70 White Rainbow Stripe Camera with attached neck strap (Please note the camera does NOT include a built-in flash)
-One new pack of Impossible Project SX-70 Color Film produced mid 2016 (Contains 8 Instant Color Photos)
FOR BEST RESULTS:
Please follow all guidelines provided by The Impossible Project on their website and included with each pack of film for your best possible results.
Based on my own personal experience, the following tips are key:
1. Keep film refrigerated when not in use. This will aid in the film’s preservation. Allow refrigerated film to reach room temperature for one hour prior to use.
2. Ensure that the camera's exposure dial (next to the lens) is set 1/3 of the way to the darkest setting.
3. Keep the film warm during shooting and developing. Cool environments will inhibit proper development.
4. Shoot the film in plenty of light. Shoot photos outdoors in sunlight or with an attached flash (NOT INCLUDED).
5. Keep your photo shielded from light during the first few minutes of development. Your photo should develop within approximately 30 minutes.
There is a learning curve associated with Polaroid instant film photography. Unlike the consistency provided by digital photography, results can vary greatly based on a number of factors. Please adjust expectations accordingly. 
Digital photography will always produce clearer, more predictable results, but it's nowhere near as fun. Every picture you take will be a true one of a kind!
NOTE ON RETURNS: I offer a generous 30-day return policy. If you choose to return the camera for any reason, I cannot offer a refund for the film unless it is unopened and unused. Any returns made without film or with opened/used film will have refunds issued for the CAMERA ONLY. For this purpose, the film is valued at 25 per pack.
EXPERIENCED SELLER: I personally inspect, clean, and test every Polaroid camera I sell. I have sold well over 1,000 of these cameras with wonderful feedback from my buyers. If you experience any mechanical problems with your camera, please contact me immediately via Etsy's mail system for assistance. I am here to help.

            A Beach Wedding Unity Sand Ceremony is a popular alternative to the traditional wedding ceremony. The ceremony is referred to as a ""sand ceremony"" because the couple literally blends sands together---often sands of two colors---to provide a visual mingling of the families.
The unity sand ceremony set includes (2) glass sand pourers 7"" tall and each  filled with sand,  your colors of choice and (1) glass heart shape keepsake vase which  is  5"" tall. Sizes are accurate and exactly as described. 
We do not engrave the glass and is not included with this listing.

WORDING YOU CAN USE FOR YOUR SAND CEREMONY
