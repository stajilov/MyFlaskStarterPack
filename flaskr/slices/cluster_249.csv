8301,Natural Deodorant  works 24 hours | Underarm Body Odor Cure |Aluminum Antiperspirant Free | Organic Ingredients,"
            PLEASE BE SURE TO SEE OUR OTHER DEODORANT VARIETIES, AND ALL OUR OTHER PRODUCTS IN OUR SHOP,
WWW.ETSY.COM/SHOP/ZIRYABSBODYBREW
==================================================
About this product:
CHRIS SAYS ""The best antiperspirant and deodorant ever! I haven't been able to find any natural deodorant that works and doesn't make me glands swell up, this is so much better than antiperspirant. My wife keeps smelling my pits and saying 'Yup, still working!' Thank you!!!""
Say goodbye to aluminum antiperspirant and hello to odor free underarms for 24 hours. No more yellow stains, no more body odor at the wrong time, no more worrying about that. 
This is the best deodorant I've ever used, never mind made myself!
This bottle holds 6 oz of deodorant. 
This is an all natural, vegan deodorant with no aluminum or alum salts. I make this in my small shop kitchen dedicated to my body products.
I am as sweaty and stinky as anyone can be. So, when I first made my homemade deodorant and it worked,  I couldn't believe it. It took me 18 months to test it in every situation and to give it to friends and family before I was sure... This stuff is a  miracle and changed my life.
Some of you who don't sweat as much as I do may think I am dramatizing but those who suffer from the kind of self-conscious concern about personal body odor that I do know exactly what I am talking about.  
Before making my natural Body Brew Deodorant, I would use 2 different commercial brand antiperspirant deodorants after showering.  Then, I'd carry another brand in my purse so I could reapply during the day.  If I forgot to bring one with me, I'd go to the nearest store and buy one. (When I was finally convinced that my deodorant was all I needed I threw out a bin of more than 20 commercial deodorants!)
If I wanted to continue my day after 8 hours without a shower, I'd bring a change of blouses. The commercial brands of deodorant worked at eliminating the body odor smell but replaced it with a smell that quickly turned from pretty to rancid under my arms.  This smell of old deodorant was almost as bad as body odor.   I knew anyone who got close to me would be able to discern the distinctive deodorant-gone-bad smell just as I can on other people.
I lived a large part of my life self-conscious and worrying about the smell of my armpits.  It was only after I was free from worry that I realized just what a huge burden it had been. In fact, I get a little bit passionate when I think of all those years of discomfort I endured that could have been solved by something as simple and healthy as my deodorant recipe. That's not to mention the years of exposure to all the chemicals they put into commercial antiperspirants. Even the so-called natural ones are full of ingredients meant to plug up your glands and make the stuff last until the new dawn. And I found that the commercial stuff worked its way into the fibers of clothes making them stiff while staining light colored clothing yellow and bleaching dark clothing light.
Now, I am wearing white and light colored blouses and t-shirts to my hearts content with no more yellow stains. Before my deodorant, I only wore white when I had to, which was pretty often since I wore a white blouse as a school uniform in High School (may years ago) and worked as a waitress for years requiring a white shirt.  
The yellow underarm stains drove me nuts but I couldn't defeat them. Finally, I learned to have a work-shirt soaking in a bucket  of sudsy water with a half bottle of hydrogen peroxide in it at all times.  When I arrived home, I'd take the shirt I was wearing off and put it in the bucket and take the next day's shirt out to dry.
Free at last!  Now, I own all kinds of white blouses and shirts, linen, delicate cottons, silks and rayons. No yellow stains, no deodorant stiffness! Woohoo!
This deodorant has made me so happy I want to share it with others.  Sure, there are other natural brands but the ones I tried didn't work for me.  I hope there are brands out there that do work as well as mine because there is plenty of room for all of us!  Plus, natural, hand-made deodorant makers, working together, can get the message out to more people that no one needs to put potentially harmful, cancer causing crap in their armpits to smell good 24 hours a day!
Once people try my deodorant, they rave about it but getting them to try it can be difficult.  I sell it at Farmer's Markets, giving out free samples just to get the word out. MANY people don't want to even bother trying it because they say ""Natural deodorants don't work for me"" 
To these people I say; ""I'll tell you what, try it and, if it doesn't work, I'll pay you a dollar."" No one has come back to collect a dollar yet but people have come back to purchase a bottle.Sometimes customers meet me at the Farmer's market before I can even set up, or they call me and ask if they can come to my house.  (I worry the neighbors will think I am selling drugs!)
My deodorant is in a lotion form. Some people have asked me to make it in a stick, bar, or roll-on. I tried all three and while I do offer a roll on Mineral deodorant for those who are sensitive to baking soda, I found that nothing worked as well as the original formula. 
You'll find that my natural deodorant feels good on hands, dries quickly and doesn't require you to wash your hands afterwards either since it is a mild antibacterial and moisturizer. However, wiping it off on another part of your body or on a towel works too and doesn't dirty the towel either.  Not only that, the deodorant is good for hands in that it contains coconut oil and either hemp and avocado oils (original scent) or apricot and grapeseed oils(lavender & rose scent.
 The clay and tapioca I use help it to It dry out quickly so it doesn't feel wet or slimy either on the hands or under the arms. Sometimes, when I am pouring out samples and inevitably get it on my hands I just dust my hands off, sometimes I give my face a small pat down with my hands because I find my deodorant absorbs any shininess and just feels and smells nice.
Even so, I thought, maybe, to make people more comfortable, I will make it in a roll on, spray or bar... I tried and tried but none of them worked as well as it does in a lotion. I am not sure why. So, I'll keep to the lotion.
AS TO THE INGREDIENTS, I once told my mother the ingredients are good enough to eat. She tells me,  once, when she didn't have toothpaste, she used my deodorant as toothpaste!  She said it didn't taste very good but it worked!  (Now I tell people, it's good enough to eat but it tastes bad and I make it for external use only).
My original scent deodorant contains: 
Organic Aloe Vera Juice
Baking Soda
Tapioca
Witch Hazel
Coconut Oil
Organic Hemp Oil
Avocado Oil
Bentonite Clay
Frankincense Powder
Organic Tea Tree Oil
Organic Neem Oil
T-50 Vitamin E
Xanthan Gum
Essential Oil Blend is light, refreshing, clean and appeals to both genders. Includes Frankincense, Lavender, Peppermint  & Geranium. Also includes Patchouli, Please note to those who dislike Patchouli, in my experience, The patchouli I use is aged and  the way I use it helps anchor the other scents without taking over.   Most people who dislike Patchouli intensely still like the scent of my deodorant. Although I don't understand the science of it, patchouli seems to help a natural deodorant ""stick"". Please see my post on Patchouli for more info: http://ziryabs.com/patchouli/
This 6 ounce squeeze bottle.
My customers confirm that one bottle lasts a long time. I'm glad but worried if my business can survive if my clients only need a bottle from me every 2 to 4 months.   So, you can help, if it turns out you love my product as much as other people, help me (and others) by spreading the word. Tell friends and family, give me a review, favorite me, whatever.
Some Baking Soda Deodorants make people rash, often simply because they are using too much, a little goes a long way. If you are interested in learning more about deodorants, please visit my website at www.ZirYabs.com.

What are Little Wishes?
Little Wishes are a beautiful way to give someone you care for a wish.  All they have to do is make a wish and then tie the cord around their wrist.  When the cord finally wears down and breaks the wish is released and will come true - so they say!
The bracelet is made from 1mm thick, waxed cotton cord and finished with a Rhodium silver star bead.
Little Wishes cords are 35mm in length and untied, so they will fit any size of wrist.  Simply remove the cord from the card and tie to secure in place, then cut off the ends. They are presented on an A6 card on 350gsm luxury linen textured card in a clear cellophane pouch and comes with a plain white envelope.
If the Little Wish is for a gift why not let us gift wrap it for you and send it directly to the recipient with a personalised note.
Card Dimensions: A6 - 148.5mm x 105mm

If you're buying this for a gift I can send  directly to the recipient, just add a note to your order with their address.
