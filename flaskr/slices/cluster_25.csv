The trend of adding a special 'aurora borealis finish' to vintage crystal and beaded jewelry was spearheaded and made popular by well-known designer Christian Dior and Manfred Swarovski.

            Vélo d'enfant de couleur vert menthe pastel.
Il a été fabriqué en France dans les années 50 par la marque Arc en ciel, aujourd'hui disparue.
Il est vraiment superbe et rare de par sa couleur et sa petite selle en simili marron.
Il manque les gardes boue, la selle sera à fixer si vous souhaitez que votre enfant s'en serve ce qui est possible. Les pneus sont blancs et en relativement bon état pour l'âge du vélo. J'ai rajouté par la suite une petite pompe à vélo qui est purement décorative.
Il a un charme fou et donnera la touche vintage et unique à la chambre de votre enfant.
Dimensions: 96 cm (37,44 inch) de long, 43cm (16,77 inch) de large et 64 cm (24,96 cm) de haut.
La selle est à 45 cm (17,55 inch) de haut
Pour certain pays européens, je peux faire partir les objets par transporteur et non par la poste ce qui pourrait s'avérer moins cher, n'hésitez pas à me demander un devis. Pour le reste du monde on peut envisager des envois par la Poste mais sans suivi ce qui serait moins cher aussi, n'hésitez pas à me demander.
Cependant, si vous faites le choix du transporteur, sachez qu’il s’agit de Mondial Relay qui propose des prix attractif mais dont les services sont peu fiables, vous devez donc savoir que je ne ferai aucun remboursement en cas d’avarie ou de perte du colis. Pour la Grande Bretagne, je déconseille franchement ce mode de livraison.

3091,Camp Blanket - Cotton/Wool Blend - Powder Blue and Camel Tan Against Cream - Soft Camp Blanket - Reversible - Arts and Crafts - Rolled Hem,"
            What great colors (love the soft powder blue) for a camp blanket and even a better pattern in reversible weave.  This blanket has a 5½"" band of geometric abstract flowers across each end and checked colors in the center.  It measures 56"" by 66"".  It has a rolled hem at the top and bottom with fraying in places.  Its faded, but still quite thick with a nice weight.  It did wash up nicely and I think smaller than normal because I think its a wood and cotton blend.   The good news is someone used this blanket and, alternately, the bad news its rough on the edges and has two holes (see photo 5) at one end.  Mix and match with other blankets.
I'm happy to ship outside the United States;  please convo for a mailing cost.

3681,"men's Sport coat, men's blazer, men's sports jacket, size 38 Reg.   # 74","
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Men's fabrique' Au Sport coat ~~~~~~
A sports coat has the ability to make a casual look sleek and pulled together,
 while transforming into a more formal outfit by adding a tie, slacks, and pocket square.
Throw on a sports coat over a polo and chinos, and you’re now dressed casual enough
 to run errands around town, or stop by your favorite restaurant for dinner.
A fitted blazer is a great fill-in for when suits are too formal and sport coats are too casual. If your profession does not require you to wear a suit, then consider a blazer as a nod to professionalism while not exceeding the office protocol.
For example, a friend of mine – a traveling salesman – keeps his blazer on its hanger in his car. When the occasion calls for formality such as meeting potential clients, he puts on his blazer. 
A blazer can be matched with paisley, striped, checked, or solid ties. For those men who can wear with confidence, a blazer with a bow tie makes for a manly impression that is often dismissed as old fashioned.
The possibilities, while not endless, give a man options that a suit cannot.
Remember that you let your clothing reflect your personality. Sometimes you will see men who have replaced the plain  buttons, with custom-made buttons with, for example, etched or stamped insignia, monograms, etc. This customizing is an often overlooked method of putting your personality into your clothing
There is a reason why the blazer has remained in style for near 100 years: it is versatile, functional, and looks great.
Great for transitional seasons and smart casual combinations.
With a little bit of creativity and an understanding of the classics, you-the young gentleman-can impress your peers, your superiors, and the ladies with a well-tailored blazer.

~~~~~Size:------------ 38 reg. (Label)  Do not rely on the size tag as your only source of reference as to whether a garment will fit. Sizing varies greatly by manufacturer and different decades were measured differently from today's sizing standards. I recommend comparing the measurements of the vintage item to an item of clothing you already own.
~~~~~Fabrics:-------- 55% polyester - 45% Laine wool
~~~~~Lining---------- 100 % Acetate
~~~~~What to wear with a sport coat
 Trousers. Blue jeans work very well with a sports jacket, especially if they are dark and fit well. This pairing is an equal balance of stylish and casual. To dress up a sports jacket, wear any odd trouser that doesn’t too closely resemble the jacket’s fabric. Also ensure the trouser’s fabric doesn’t compete for attention (such as having a pattern if the sport jacket does), and is of a similar weight. This last one is tricky, as many men try to match heavyweight tweeds with lightweight dress slacks; this rarely works as well as a solid-colored flannel or corduroy trouser.

            The hat box is very bright and has the original insert. There is creasing to one end (see pics) it still displays very well. The fedora is in good vintage condition, with a fair amount of wear staining to the inside. Overall a nice set in good vintage condition. No size label but it fits my husband so we believe it to be a 7. Not 100% sure though. 
Great storage, lovely hat, nice display. It would also make a great prop for a movie / photoshoot or theatrical production.

11610,"The Garden Coop Walk-In Chicken Coop Plan eBook (PDF), Instant Download, Imperial Units (Feet/Inches)","
            The Garden Coop walk-in chicken coop plans give you the foundation — and the freedom — to build the perfect chicken coop for your backyard flock. Whether you're new to chickens or to building, these plans get you closer to raising your own farm-fresh eggs, without turning your backyard into a barnyard. 
Some key features of The Garden Coop design:
» Houses up to 8 hens, or customize it for more
» Walk in through the full-sized door
» Spread your wings in the spacious run
» Know your flock is safe with a 360° protection against rodents and predators
» Easily modify the design to suit your flock, climate, and needs
» Offers ample ventilation and light with a unique ""open"" roof design
» Secure, integrated run with open floor, nice roosts, and grazing area
» Simple cuts, easy-to-find materials, and straightforward coop assembly
» Hardware quick kit available (see our other listings)
About the chicken coop plan itself:
» Written for beginners. This 45-page e-book includes a detailed tools and materials list, measurements, photos, diagrams, and step-by-step instructions to show you how to build a coop that you (and your chickens. . . and neighbors) will love.
» Includes extra details, photos, and construction tips based on years of customer feedback
» Compatible with iPad and other PDF-friendly tablets, phones, and readers
» Password protected for security. You will receive your password after checkout. (Visit your Etsy Purchases page and click the Download button next to the order.)
» Comes with email support, directly from the designer.
The Garden Coop is an original, proven design that's been built by backyard chicken keepers around the world since 2008. So when you set out with these plans, you not only get responsive, email support from the designer, but you also enjoy the benefit of the collective knowledge, ideas, and examples from The Garden Coop community of builders. 
More specs and details:
SIZE: The outer dimensions of The Garden Coop measure about 10'w x 6'd x 8'h. (You also want to leave about 2-3 feet of working space on all sides.) Inside, the run offers about 50 square feet of space. The henhouse offers 15 square feet, including room for a couple roosts and a double nest box, the instructions for which are included in the plan. You can build exterior nest boxes with our free online plans, the link to which you'll find in your eBook. 
MATERIALS: The coop is made primarily of lumber, hardware cloth, polycarbonate roofing, the siding of your choice, and the hardware to bring it all together. Purchased new, these materials should run you roughly 750-850 USD, pre-tax. A complete materials list is in the plan. Also, see our other listings for a pre-packaged hardware quick kit.
TIME TO BUILD: About 2-3 weekends, if you're working mostly alone. But it's even more fun to build with a partner and/or kids!
TOOLS: This plan is written for beginners. The cuts are all straightforward (no tricky angles to measure), and the tools are pretty standard ones that you likely either have or can easily borrow or buy. Here's the tool list from the plan:
» Tape measure
» Pencil
» Circular saw
» Jig saw (optional, for special curves, e.g., windows)
» Handsaw
» Pair of sawhorses
» Hammer
» Cordless power drill/driver, with various bits
» Level
» Wire snips
» Leather work gloves
» Shovel
» Ladder
» Combination square or speed square for marking crosscuts
» An extra pair of hands, on occasion (best if attached to a strong body)
CLIMATE: You'll find The Garden Coop at home just about everywhere — from sunny Florida, Australia, and Texas to chilly Wisconsin, Alaska, Germany, and even the Rockies (at an altitude of 7,000 feet!). That's because what chickens need most of all is proper ventilation and fresh air. In the winter, the henhouse section of The Garden Coop offers refuge from the bitterest cold, and it's designed so that you can easily add insulation, windows, electric heat, or whatever your climate demands.

Accepted File Formats
- Adobe Illustrator CC (or earlier)

- Photoshop files should be 100-120dpi at full output size.
- Do not embed color profiles.
- Provide a layered file.
- When using stock photography images, be sure to purchase the highest resolution version that your budget will allow.
- We use CMYK printers to create these graphics. 100% reproduction of defined colors is not possible. Differences between colors in the printed and original file can occur at many different stages. Variations in color or shading are often a result of viewing on un-calibrated equipment (monitors, printers, etc). Colors will often appear different when viewed on two different monitors or output devices. Without accurate color information, we have no way of ensuring that expected colors will be achieved.
- The use of multiple banner displays to create a single mural effect is NOT recommended. We do not guarantee matched vertical or horizontal placement between banners. There may also be slight curling after time on banner edges. Please see our full line of mural displays designed for mural purposes.
