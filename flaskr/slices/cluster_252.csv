About our soaps..
ðŸ›€ Each bar we make contains over ONE FULL OUNCE of pure goat's milk from our own sweet dairy goats!! We do not dilute with any water because we want your soap to be as rich as possible and to provide you with the all the goodness that Goat's Milk offers....a full spectrum of minerals and unique lipids that are beneficial as well as naturally occurring alpha-hydroxy acids that exfoliate and soften your skin as you wash.
ðŸ›€ Our soaps have a creamy, luxurious texture, plenty of lather and are formulated to help your skin remain moisturized, calm and happy!  Bars now contain over 10% shea butter for it's creamy/fluffy/moisturizing lather and to increase the life of you soap.
ðŸ›€The ingredients we use are very straightforward and our products contain no preservatives, parabens, phthalates or petroleum products.  Only Fresh Goats Milk, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Palm Oil, Palm Kernel Oil, Shea Butter, Castor Oil, Sodium Lactate, Glycerin, Color, Fragrance, Honey & Vitamin E. 
ðŸ’¦We use a moderate amount of fragrance in our soaps, so that there is enough scent for you to enjoy as you wash with it, but at a level that will not be overpowering.
More on the curing rack are soon to be added!  Please see our shop announcements section for a list of upcoming varieties!  Link-

9628,Animal Crossing Music Box,"
            Enjoy a music box rendition of your favourite video game tunes!
A sturdy (~9cm) wooden box hand-painted, varnished and fitted with a musical component that plays songs arranged on strips. These are fed through the box by turning a crank handle on the side.
Each music strip has a custom design printed in high quality on sturdy satin paper. Songs are hand-punched into the strip and tested for good sound quality. Choose from the available songs or suggest your own! Additional song strips can be purchased from my shop.
Swing by https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpAKER-SUhJ4rMghX93FZVQ for videos of songs already available.
***********
This listing is for an Animal Crossing-themed music box, with one song strip included.
Choose one of these songs for free:
- New Leaf theme
- Wild World/City Folk theme
- ...or suggest your own! New themes and songs will be added over time, but get in touch if there's a particular tune you'd like, and I'll arrange it for you. Check my other listings for individual songs.
You can also choose from these three strip designs (see photos):
- sky
- grass

15061,Deer Head Papercraft PDF Pack,"
            This model is a geometric recreation of the most common and classic taxidermy head: the deer head. The final model is approximately 22-23 inches from the bottom of the head to the top of the antler. Consider this is a more animal friendly version of taxidermy! This model requires some experience, as the antlers can be tricky to put together. Be sure you have plenty of patience and time before starting!
This PDF Pack contains all the necessary digital files needed to make a 3D, life size deer head papercraft. Within this pack, you will receive:
-A4 Sized Deer Head Papercraft Template (26 pages)
-Letter Sized Deer Head Papercraft Template (26 pages)
-General Instructions Guide (1 Page)
-THE PDFs HAVE NO COLORS OR TEXTURES. TO MAKE A COLORED MODEL, PRINT ON COLORED PAPER-
To create this model with the same coloration as the images shown above, print the following parts/pages on these colored papers:
Pages 1-17 (Base / Head / Ears): Brown Paper
Page 18-26 (Antlers): White/Ivory Paper
To make this model, print the PDFs on high quality cardstock (preferably 65lb or 176g/m^2 weight).To create this model with a different color for the antlers, be aware that the last 9 pages in the PDF are for the antlers, and can be printed on a different color cardstock.
This deer model is a fantastic piece of art, which can match any style of room, from a hunter's den to a minimalistic office. The final model can be hung anywhere, and can could be for yourself or a gift!
The templates feature Edge ID numbers for matching edges to flaps, which makes the assembly process much easier. Based on a previous review, I made sure to increase the size of the Edge ID font for easier readability. In addition, the templates contain part identification headers to help keep you organized and aware of what part of the model each piece belongs to. Visit it if you ever need help, or feel free to contact me! The final model looks fantastic, and is fantastic wall decor. These files are great for anyone who enjoys papercraft, or someone who would like to begin.
