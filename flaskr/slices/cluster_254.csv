8836,100% Natural Ayurvedic eyelash serum oil eyebrow  growth conditioner 11 ml - thicker longer healthier lashes rosemary essential oil Ayurveda,"
            Eyelash eyebrow serum - 100% Natural- 100% chemical and preservative free.
INGREDIENTS:  Cold pressed, extra virgin Organic Castor oil (Hexane free),amla oil,Bringaraj,	Brahmi,Amla, Vitamin E oil,jojoba oil,almond oil,lavender Essential oil	Rosemary essential oil,Litsea cubeba essential oil.	
Castor oil is one of the best kept secrets in the world of natural beauty.  Taken from the bean of the Castor plant, this oil is rich in ricinoleic acid (omega-9 fatty acid), which exerts powerful therapeutic effects. It will help your eyelashes to grow thick and long, and can keep them from breaking. It can also help you grow new eyebrow hair in bare areas that might have been over-tweezed. This unique blend of carefully chosen oils will nourish and condition eyelashes and brows making it longer healthier and stronger.
DIRECTIONS:With just a swipe or two on your eyelashes every night before bedtime and again each morning. The same directions apply for your eyebrows as well.This serum is safe to use up to 3 times a day if desired and won't irritate your eyes
MY PERSONAL REVIEW:
 "" 100% Natural Lubricant for the eyes""
Excellent eye make up remover & its 100% Natural. At bedtime, I apply the ""roll on tube"" ( I use kajal  eye liner heavily)and wipe off the kajal, now I apply a second coat to stimulate hair growth.
As a toddler I didn't have much of eyebrow hair and my aunt & mom used to apply castor oil on my eyebrows and till now it grows crazy, I need to thread them every 20 days :-(, I'm a believer "" Castor oil helps hair grow :-)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOMER REVIEWS:
------------------------------
I enjoy this and appreciated the free sample that was included! I have been wearing it the past couple of days as an alternative to mascara as it makes lashes dark (be sure to curl them first to get the full mascara-esque experience!). It had leaked a little bit but nothing major. :-) the sample of the shampoo bar was awesome as well, doesn't dry hair like most shampoo bars I have tried. Very nice and can't wait til that sandalwood oil is re-stocked! :-)
************************************************************************************
I don't even use this daily and my eye lashes still look amazing. I'm barely losing lashes and they look healthier and longer :)
