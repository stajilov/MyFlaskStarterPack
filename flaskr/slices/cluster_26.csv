~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dream Pets are collectable miniature stuffed animals, made of velveteen and filled with Willow sawdust, manufactured in Japan beginning in 1957 by Japanese toy designers Tochigi Mongi and Tomy for R. Dakin & Co. The manufacturer surprised Dakin by using these little toys as packing material for a shipment of battery operated toy trains which Dakin had ordered. That same day the president of Dakin, Roger Dakin, placed an order by cable to Japan for 25 dozen of the little velveteen toys, by the end of the day he changed his order to 300 dozen.
By 1961 Dream Pets were being designed by Dakin's senior toy designer Virginia Kemp in the United States. The toys became popular, and by the end of 1979 there were over 2000 different characters. In 1995 Dakin merged with The Applause Toy Co. Applause Toys re-issued copies of 24 of the vintage Dream Pets in 2004.
In late 2005, Dakin ceased to operate as an independent company. The names Dakin and Dream Pets were purchased by retail chain Big Lots, as of July 2011 Big lots had not produced any further Dream pets.        ",20.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1960s

366,Antique Ride On Toy St. Bernard Wheeled Toy Dog Ride On Toy England C1908 1912,"
            Adorable wheeled ride on toy made by L. Bros, LTD England.  I believe this is made out of a hard type of plastic on steel frame and original wheels. The dogs eyes look to be glass and over all good condition. There is some condition issues with paint ware on dogs mouth.  Orange handles has some paint ware but does not take away any of its charm.  This toy is still sturdy and tires in good condition, front left tire is a little loose but not going anywhere.
Last photo=(SnowFlake, real dog not included:)
Measures Aprox: 19"" long by 10"" wide / 16"" to top of dogs head and 24"" to top of handle bar.
Childs fun toys are becoming musuem curios and this one is rare.
Shipping includes insurance and tracking.  Estimate may be high and is calculated from coast to coast. I will adjust according to your zip code.
Please remember that my items are mostly Victorian and always used, never new or in new condition. They have sat on many tables, held by many loving hands and lived an eventful life. They may have flaws which is part of the character of each individual Victorian or Vintage item. I try to list as accurately as possible but to get a close look up view of each item just expand the pictures. By doing this you will never be disappointed and will know exactly what to expect.

            Great set of two (2) vintage pink velvet throw pillows from the 1960's.  Pillows are square and done in a soft pink velvet.  The center is stuffed, and the exterior ruffle is loose.  Pillows measure 15"" square including ruffle.  Overall, good vintage condition.  One pillow is a slightly different shade (see photo 1), most likely the result of sun fading.  There are a few areas of wear to the velvet, but no odors or tears.  A fun set for your mid century decor!

1857,1943 Vintage Map of France with Inspirational Travel Quote by Anita Desai,"
            WHO 
needs this wanderlust-ness on her/his wall? Who is almost ready to explore the World, but just needs a little push? Your friend, a loved one or maybe – you?
The travel allure of this vintage map of France is amplified with the inspiring quote by Anita Desai. Decades that passed gave this map a certain patina - the look, smell & feel of the adventure, of the unexplored. Combined with the inspirational quote it will be just the catalyst needed to push it's owner ""to roam the roads of lands remote"".
MAP 
was printed in 1943, as part of German Pocket Atlas ""Justus Perthes' Taschenatlas Der Ganzen Welt"". This is a map of France (1:7 500 000). 
This is vintage original, not a scan, modern reproduction or color print. Please use the zoom feature to see more details. Due to it's age it is expected for it to show some signs of use. 
DIMENSIONS 
6.6 x 7.6 in / 16.7 x 19.4 cm 
QUOTE 
on a black embossing tape by Anita Desai: 
Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow. 
YOU WILL RECEIVE 
this original vintage map and a quote on a black embossing tape. The embossing tape is self adhesive but it won't be glued to the map, you will glue it yourself. The embossing tape will be cut as the text layout on the photos. The frame is not included. 
SHIPPING
your map and embossing tape will be carefully packaged in a separate clear plastic sleeves/foil for protection and will be sent in an original Croatian Post high-quality corrugated cardboard envelope/trapeze shape box. It will be shipped as a Priority Registered mail within three working days after receiving full payment.
OPTIONS
- you may ask for a different text layout of this quote (if you have some other frame dimensions or if you have some other idea how it would look better)
- if you think that some quote from another map would be better you may ask for it. Take your time and check out all the MapsToGo : )
- if you would like to have some quote that you found somewhere else or some other text you may ask for it.

1876,Vintage Globe Perpetual Calendar // World Map // Map Decor // Vintage Calendar // Vintage Globe // Vintage Map // Asian Language,"
            This great vintage globe perpetual calendar is such a fun accent! The months and days of the week are written in an Asian language, which is a pretty neat touch!
In good vintage condition. The numbers change when flipping the globe, but sometimes it needs a little jingle to slide the number down. The wheel holding the months and days of the week is bowed a bit in the center...look closely at the photos.

Above the other front pocket it has ""CUB SCOUTS B.S.A."" in yellow/gold letters.

Krizia indigo knit dress features incredible design and tailoring. Fascinating ""sleeveless"" pattern at right arm.

The left sleeve has 17 functioning plum buttons extending from the top of the mock neck down to the wrist. There is an unusual demi-slit at the right side of the neckline which is part of this magnificent and unique creation. 
Two deep hidden hip pockets, high waist styling, and raglan sleeve design. This Krizia dress an exceptional treasure from the 1980's, and a priceless model for avant garde patternmaking.

4458,Vintage Samsonite Carry-On Bag - Samsonite Silhouette Messenger Bag - Choice of Strawberry Red or Tangerine Orange - Vegan Friendly,"
            Love bags and suitcases? DollFood has more at:
http://www.etsy.com/shop/DollFood/search?search_query=SUITCASE
In excellent vintage condition, this listing is for one (1) gorgeous messenger style bag, likely from the 70s, labeled Samsonite Silhouette, with four handy storage compartments.  You get to choose whether you prefer the strawberry red or tangerine orange shade - both bright and beautiful so you're sure to be a winner either way!  If you decide you can't live without them both, we wouldn't blame you: just convo us and we can get you a combined shipping quote, no worries.
There is one main large zippered compartment with a small zippered pocket inside, one front zippered pocket, and one back open pocket.  Perfect for all your carry on, overnight travel, or commuting needs, this sturdy and attractive bag is larger than most of the high quality bags Samsonite manufactured in the 70s, and can serve you in a variety of fabulous ways.
The fabulous faux leather of this bag is complemented by the matching vinyl piping found on all the edges that helps to protect the bag.  The pinky red bag has a pleather look to it (faux leather) with a hint of light pink mixed in with the strawberry red shade, and the orange bag features more of a snakeskin texture with a bit of yellow throughout.  LOVE the mottled depth and texture on both exteriors - so rich!  
Tons of real stitching throughout the exterior will keep your bag in good shape for a long time to come, and, incredibly enough - despite being 40 years old - there is not a stitch missing anywhere!  The quality of this bag is demonstrated further by the reinforced straps and additional stitching found on the smaller sides of the bag.  
There is very little sign of wear on this super useful and cool retro vegan friendly bag.  There are a few scuffs on the vinyl exterior, including a few signs of age beginning on the metal hardware, although most parts positively shine with the bright silver chrome accents that are like ""jewelry"" for the bag!  The interior does show wear and has a bit of ""old suitcase"" smell, including wrinkles, light stains, and a few minor places where the vinyl is coming away or splitting, but nothing that should affect function much, if at all.  This bag has a ton of life in it yet and can't wait to accompany you on your next travel adventure!
It can be difficult to find one of these fantastic quality Samsonite Silhouette carry on bags from the 70s in such fabulous shades as these are.  What a cool, retro messenger bag for you to carry your laptop or iPad in!  Given as a gift, we have no doubt that your recipient, if they truly appreciate vintage and love bags, would be absolutely delighted and ever grateful for your amazing taste and incredible thoughtfulness.
All hardware is working smoothly, fully functional (minus the key for the zipper lock), done in an attractive and eye-catching silver chrome tone.  Love the chrome Samsonite badging on one side of the bag -- so very retro and eye-catching!  All compartments are lined with a practical vinyl like material, and the very bottom inside of the bag features adorable tone-on-tone matching polka dots!  The bag is nicely stabilized upright when you set it down with a very sturdy bottom that has four shiny chrome feet on the very bottom of the bag.  The bag features double straps attached with metal hardware, and includes extra strap length and reinforcement down to the bottom of each side of the bag to stabilize your heavier loads.  We think this also offers a bit of extra special style!  (So, can you tell that the more I study this bag to describe it to you, the more I want to keep it?!)

            Late 19th C Victorian Man's Vest with Shawl Collar in Velvet 
Great looking man's shawl collar vest in a simply fabulous printed velvet of the period.

The front is done in a wonderful black velvet printed with tan leaves outlined in lavender mixed with tiny dots of red  berries on a brown vine.

4651,Vernon A. Begaye Bolo Tie Navajo Inlaid,"
            This classic bolo tie is marked Sterling and VAB for the award-winning Navajo silversmith Vernon A. Begaye, whose parents were both Native American jewelers also. He combines a knowledge of traditional Southwestern motifs with a familiarity with clean, simple, modern design, and those contrasting inspirations show in this striking piece with its meticulously-inlaid strips of stone and shell. This piece is in very good condition with no damage, which includes the center, the leather tie, and the handmade silver tips.
The centerpiece of this bolo measures 2 1/4 inches tall by 1 1/2 inches at its widest point, and the leather tie is 30 inches long, not including the tips, which are each 2 inches long. This striking and unique piece of Navajo jewelry would delight any collector of bolo ties, whether they are male or female.

            ***46 YEARS OLD and COUNTING..................................................
1970's Retro Chic
Volupte was known for their stylish accessory cases, but was most famous for their perfect palm-sized compacts. Our solid brass Volupte compacts feature a fun and funky green and bronze design and a beveled mirror. Each compact’s design is slightly different, making them highly unique. 
The compacts have been untouched for nearly 50 years and are in excellent condition. These vintage pieces were made to be shown off: use one as a pill case or for a quick makeup touchup. 
***I have not cleaned or altered their original condition, each still has its original foam packing used to protect the mirror- which it dried out after 47 years ***

4881,Antique Penny Dreadful Valentine,"
            Antique Penny Dreadful or ""Vinegar"" Valentine
Wonderful early Vinegar Valentine or insult card from the late 19th C. 
Penny dreadfuls were usually decorated with a caricature and (below it) an insulting verse.  They were produced in America as early as 1850.  Some were produced by such prestigious publishing houses like McLoughlin, Tuck, etc.  This one is signed "" Made in US Amer""
The subjects were, more often than not, of people with animals being a bit more scarce.
This one of a cat is quite well done and wonderful.  Measuring 10 by 7 1/2 inches, it is in very good condition with fold lines attendant with age and use.  
I've always loved this one for its ""charming"" cat and verse (however, being a cat lover , I can honestly say I've not met too many a cat to fit that description).  But the best thing about this one is the inscription on the back :
              ""To Miss Hess
                                from Lawrence Healy""
Probably Lawrence, a student, gave this to his teacher, Miss Hess on Valentine's Day.  Would you have loved to have been a fly on the wall in that classroom when she read it?        ",135.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1800s

            These are Apple wood STICKS cut to 8 1/4 inch length approximately.
The thickness is from around 1/4 inch to a bit more than 1/2 inch. They are borderline chinchilla ( a bit thick ) and borderline bunny rabbit ( a bit thin ).
Photo 2 shows what 1 pound of Sticks amounts to.
They are fresh though. I cut them January, 2017. Someone wanted very thin STEMS and someone else wanted TWIGS. These are the left over pieces - a bit too thick to be thin stems and definitely not twigs.
I bet though that somewhere there is a chinchilla, degu or bunny that would buy these if they read about them and saw the photo.

7579,"Attar of Roses Bath Oil,  4oz fragrant bath oil of roses and sandalwood, inspired by ancient India with skin loving organic grapeseed oil","
            Character: Sensual, aphrodisiac, youthful
Notes: Victorian Rose, Sandalwood
Skin Benefits: A combination of four skin-loving oils leave your skin moisturized and nourished.
Originating in 16th century India, this classic fragrance was first devised at the wedding feast of a famous Mogul Emperor. As the young newlyweds took a celebratory boat ride in a moat filled with rose petals, the bride noticed a fragrant oil had formed on the surface of the water. To capture the essence of this fateful day, the Emperor ordered the oil bottled in a base of sandalwood oil, a combination that became a staple in Indian households for centuries. True to its origins, this oil fuses the ancient fragrances of rose and sandalwood.
With a light fragrance concentration, like an eau de toilette, this bath oil will leave you with a subtle fragrance, perceivable by those that are close enough to brush against the skin. A truly relaxing and luxurious pleasure. The oil base includes:
Sweet Almond Oil- Rich in Vitamins E,A, and D, Sweet Almond Oil traps moisture in the skin, leaving it glowing all day.
Rice Bran Oil- A super antioxidant oil, with Vitamins E and B, which help increase elasticity and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Jojoba Oil- Similar to the natural oil produced by the human body, Jojoba gently heals wounds and helps fade scars over time.
Grapeseed Oil- Light, non-greasy Grapeseed Oil is packed with skin-brightening Vitamin C.

            Listing includes 4 bath truffles, made with a beautiful rose fragrance, moisturizing cocoa butter, and real honey and milk powder.  
You can really have the best of both worlds with these truffles...a luxurious bubble bath and moisturizing, skin loving ingredients combined! 
**Hold** one truffle under warm running water until dissolved for soft  bubbles, (it doesn't take long and trust me it's worth it). You can also hang an organza or muslin bag and let the water run through.  Or you can simply place one in the tub for a soft melty foam.  Either way, the cocoa butter, milk and honey in these truffles will leave your skin soft and nourished.
Melt your worries away and take care of your skin with these moisture-rich bath truffles. 
*Please use caution in the tub as this may leave it a little slippery.

9353,Morrissey dancing string puppet - The Smiths,"
            At Last! Manchester's Mayor of Melancholy lovingly rendered in puppet form!
Yes, from The Smiths to his many solo hits and his books, Morrissey has enthralled a rain-soaked, cobbled-street, heavy-overcoat-wearing nation. And also South America apparently.
Hang this charming puppet from a mantlepiece, patio door or above your desk and with just a pull of a string he comes to life in an approximation of 'that' famous Top Of The Pops appearance.
Somewhat amateur footage of the puppet in action can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/9_UKHehd8fw
A perfect gift for a Morrissey or The Smiths fan. A rotten gift for someone who can't stand him.
Would also make a SUPERB Valentine gift for an unrequited love.
Painstakingly cut by hand from high quality, durable mountboard, with metal eyelets and paper fasteners...and string.
It's about 19cm tall not counting the strings and stuff.
NOTE: NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN - SMALL METAL PARTS.

            We made this gorgeous laptop sleeve of rich, durable vegetable tanned leather and soft suede lining. The sleeve is perfect for 13 inch laptops and provides secure protection due to thick soft padding and extremely durable leather. 
We'd love to personalize the sleeve for you with gold, silver or blind embossed initials. Please follow the personalization instructions below.
The laptop sleeve closes effortlessly with a flap on two round magnetic locks. It's a snug fit for your computer, but it will never scratch it thanks to gentle suede lining and no metal hardware. The sleeve has a card holder in front for credit or business cards, a full size slip-in back pocket on a hidden magnetic lock for a notebook or documents, and an open cut on the side for the charger (perfect fit for a 13"" macbook).
This sleek minimalist laptop sleeve is ideal for daily office or meeting use and will make an amazing gift for a busy professional.

***** SHIPPING & RETURNS *****

We accept returns without asking questions, just contact us within 3 days of the product delivery. Please note that customized products are not eligible for returns. 
*****OUR MATERIALS*****
We use premium full grain vegetable tanned leather to make our laptop sleeves, which is the leather that is tanned using non-toxic organic barks and leaves over a period of 30 to 40 days (unlike fast-made low-cost chrome tanned leathers that are harmful to health and environment). We source our leather from a reputable US based tannery that focuses on sustainable leather production. Vegetable tanned leather has natural color and earthy sweet smell, and develops a gorgeous patina with time preserving the story of its owner and making each piece truly unique. This means no two laptop sleeves made by us will be exactly the same!
Vegetable tanned leather, w​ith the right feeding & care,​ ​also has the ability to heal ​scratches (unlike chrome tanned leathers, which, once scratched, cannot be repaired without re-tanning). This ability makes veg tanned leather products much more durable than any chemically tanned leather goods, and keeps them presentable and rich looking for years.
***** ABOUT US *****
We nourish simplicity and elegance in our designs. Mix stunning textures, subtle geometry of shapes, warm loving craftsmanship infused with patience and attention to detail – and that is how our bags are born. Every bag is carefully cut and made by hand in our little art studio, surrounded by Californian sunlight, music, smell of coffee and refreshing greens of our ficus tree. 
Each product is gift wrapped with love and care and shipped promptly around the world. We are available at any time (apart from sleeping!) to answer your questions and help you make the right choice.

14924,PDF Needle Tatting Pattern - Star Flower Motif,"
            This listing is for the PDF PATTERN ONLY, not the finished item or a printed pattern.
This is a needle tatting pattern I designed and compiled in PDF format. It has written instructions in English, and  step by step photographs, but not a diagram. This is just one pattern that may be made into a pendant, earrings or stand alone motif ornament. It may also be made with the shuttle, but the instructions are needle specific and I can not advise regarding shuttle.
Techniques used are rings, chains, lock stitch chains, and weaving rings. It includes instructions for making the piece with 10 thread and a size 5 needle as pictured though other thread sizes may also be used for a different finished size.
The file size is 2.7MB and is a PDF document. You need to have Adobe Reader on your computer in order to open this file.
You may give away or sell the items you have made using this pattern offline. You may not distribute or sell the pattern itself.        ",3.25,4.9836,"Handmade Supply

   GREAT for Beginner Lampworkers!<<<
Lampwork EBook Tutorial
by Christina Catherine of CCGlassArt
Includes:
**Over 60 color photos*
**33 easy-to-read pages**
**Detailed murrini instructions**
**A Torch-Side Reference Guide**
**Troubleshooting tips**
...and SO much more!!
I am often asked if my other two tutorials (Making Beautiful Murrini, and Making Beautiful Encased Murrini Beads) are suitable for beginner lampworkers.
While a beginner can certainly work up to that level eventually, there may be a degree of frustration producing pleasing results right off the bat for those who are new to lampworking.
That's why I came up with this quick and easy, fail-proof method to make adorably whimsical Daisy Flower Murrini that does not require any extensive lampwork experience. 
Even better, it does not require any special lampworking tools (such as a pricey Optic Mold)!
My Daisy Murrini can be easily made with basic tools any beginner lampworker should already have readily available.
Even if you are a more experienced lampworker, sometimes you just want to whip up a no-fuss murrini to add to a bead design that still looks cute and impressive - am I right? 
This simple Daisy Murrini design is perfect for that!
When you are ready to take your murrini making - and encased murrini bead - skills to the next level be sure to check out my first two tutorials:

This information from another website:
""Swank is one of the most well known and famous makers of cufflinks and tie accessories, and has been for many years. 
The company that started Swank has actually been around since 1897, and Swank has been making jewelry and accessories since their earliest days, under different names. In 1908, they expanded their line of women’s jewelry, offering men’s jewelry and so began their reputation for cufflinks and tie related jewelry.  
While the company has been making jewelry since the early 1900’s, the name Swank was not used until the late 1920’s and most jewelry you find these days that is clearly marked as Swank will be from the 50’s or 60’s. Most Swank jewelry is made of goldtone metal, and not of precious metals, but the quality in design and build is well known"".        ",81.93,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1950s

18653,Mystic Topaz Vintage Filigree Antique 925 Fine S0LID Sterling Silver Men's / Unisex CUFFLINKS k284,"
            Concept: The cufflinks are casted out of Solid Fine sterling silver (Nickel Free). Great care was taken to hand layer the filigree vintage pattern enclosing each stone. The flexible posts are casted out of silver as well. Antique polish was applied to the entire outer layer to preserve and showcase its vintage texture.  
As an introductory launch into Men's line of Jewelry, I have marked these cufflinks to the bare minimum cost (includes anti tarnish case) to allow my clients to enjoy a whole new paradigm of sleek cuff links with versatile appeal for a lesser value. 
Craftsmanship: I wanted to do something bit more creative than what was done / is being already offered regarding men's cufflinks. To start at the very beginning, I decided to buy rough rocks straight from local mines/ suppliers by the lbs to procure the cabs in the exact shape and size necessary to begin my journey. Next step, was to use variety of vintage, contemporary and unique patterns to totally enclose the stone with silver (avoid the latch/prong setting) which gives the cufflinks  more depth and durability. 
Price & Affordability: Considering the large varieties of gemstones used in the cufflinks, I wanted to keep the price barrier at a lower point. One way to accomplish this is to cut the cabs from the rough rocks directly, which eliminates the need for a middleman. Secondly this gives me larger control/flexibility over the quality and pattern of cabs that can be extracted.
 ►Why buy my cufflinks over the ones available in the market? 
■ The answer to that is quite simple. I concentrate my effort on gemstones primarily, which allows me to offer my customers with a product that is authentic and high end from the Get-go. Even if you were to go buy cabs of this quality, it is going to cost you quite a bit. Lots of time and effort is spent on the craftsmanship of each of these cufflinks. Unlink most cufflinks available, these are ""not"" DIY project where you stick a pre-made plastic or metal frame to a post. It is a prolonged procedure from start to finish.

            The ideal set to complete that special outfit. Formal with a bit of a twist and lots of intense color. I have handcrafted this set by fusing together a black base glass and squares of rich emerald green dichroic glass. In the kiln the liquid glass forms round cabochons - the perfect shape for this set. The depth of color is fabulous and the slightly textured glass is incredibly tactile!
The set comprises of a set of 925 Sterling Silver chain and toggle cufflinks. These are roundish with an approximate diameter of 18mm (6/8"") and five 925 sterling silver shirt/tuxedo studs which are also round and have an approximate diameter of 8mm (5/16"").
They will be sent inside a leatherette cufflink box. If these are intended as a gift please let me know at checkout and I will include a gift card in the package.

            I designed the fabrics used for all of the clothes in my store. (YES!)
From my cosy home studio, I draw, paint and take photographs to my heart's content. These stunning creations are then printed on beautiful fabrics to create boutique clothes that will make your body sing! They cannot be bought from any other designer. 
The smooth lines flatter the figure, and the joyous designs convey a sense of fun.
You can pair this skirt with a simple top and shoes to create an amazing outfit with minimum effort.

THE DETAILS:
-Your skirt is made from ultra-stretch fabric that won’t lose its shape or fade after washing
-The texture feels like a beautiful bikini-style material
-It would look great sitting on the beach (or at a cafe, or anywhere!)
-(88% polyester 12% spandex)
-Easy care: machine wash cold. Tumble dry on regular or hang to dry.

SIZES:
Please see the size chart in the last photo.

LENGTH:
All skirts are approximately 20 inches (50cm) long.

THE BORING STUFF:
I have sold these clothes all over the world. ( You can read the 100% positive reviews at 
TheCateEscape.etsy.com
 !)
The design will be positioned slightly differently on each garment. 
These skirts are ""made to order"" and so I cannot offer refunds if you choose the wrong size or have a ""change of mind"" . I am an artist and I design these amazing fabrics . I do not own any large machinery, so I get the my designs printed elsewhere. They usually require a week to be made, and then they are sewn up and posted to you. They can take a while to arrive at your door, but these stunning clothes are worth the wait!  Thank you for your patience. Your body thanks you too :)        ",53.72,4.9286,"Handmade item

            Ready for your next crochet project? Snuggle up with your favorite yarn and crochet this quick and cozy cardigan. The Airport Cardigan features drop sleeves, a long roomy bodice, and a squishy textured design paired with traditional ribbing. 
THIS IS NOT A FINISHED CARDIGAN. THIS IS AN INSTANT DOWNLOAD PATTERN AFTER PURCHASE. You will not be receiving a cardigan in the mail. Failure to read item descriptions indicating that this is a pattern will not result in refunds. 
You may not reproduce or claim this or any variations of this pattern as your own. However, you MAY sell any finished products created as a result of following this pattern. Please credit this shop (Calou Shop) as the pattern creator when selling your finished items. See pattern download for full rights. 
NOTES BEFORE BUYING:
I consider this an intermediate pattern. Crocheters with general knowledge of building knit garments should find this to be a straightforward pattern that is easy to adjust and customize.  
There are no stitch tutorials within the pattern for the following stitches: 
- single crochet, 
- half double crochet/crocheting in back loops of hdc,  
- slip stitch, 
- chaining, and 
- yarning over. 
Stitches and techniques that are covered with tutorials within the pattern are: 
- glover stitch/glover cluster and 
- joining ribbing to a garment as you create the ribbing. 
Please reference the last listing photo for sizing and measurements. I size this cardigan as a roomy medium, traditional large and slim extra large. I also offer in-pattern guidance on where and how to adjust the cardigan to your needs. 
Pattern and sizing is written in US terms and calls for approximately 2000 yards of a silky medium weight yarn, (i.e. Caron Simply Soft, Bernat Satin, Red Heart Soft).
PATTERN FEATURES INCLUDE:
- clear and conversational pattern instructions, minimal jargon and abbreviations. 
- full color, photo tutorials regarding complicated stitching and techniques.
- alteration points so you can adjust the pattern to fit your body perfectly.
- shop support while working through pattern, if needed!        ",6.00,5.0,"Handmade item
