2426,Natural Morenci Turquoise Cabochon 27.5 Carat Cab Stone Untreated Gemstone Gems Jewelry Findings MC09,"
            27.59 carat Morenci Turquoise Cab from the Morenci Mine in Arizona. It measures 32.2mm x 25.7mm X  3.6mm.
I guarantee it's authenticity and that it is 100% NATURAL and free of treatments of any kind.
The stone has a slight layer of backing.
About the Morenci Mine:
The Morenci turquoise mine produced a turquoise that is light to bright blue in hue. This stone has an unusual matrix of irregular quartz and pyrite that, when polished, often resembles silver. Also, a small amount of Morenci turquoise had some brownish matrix called “Morenci red matrix”. One of the first American turquoises to come to the market, Morenci is highly valued and difficult to obtain.
 It is located in southeastern Arizona in the Shannon Mountain and is the by-product of a large copper producing open-pit mine. The first records of this area were those of Henry Clifton and an army scout by the name of Robert Metcalf in 1864. William “Lucky” Brown and J.W. Edgar were mining turquoise at the Carico Lake Mine in Nevada when they received a letter that offered them the turquoise mining rights at Morenci. They partnered in Morenci for seven months until J.W. went back to Nevada. Mr. Brown leased and marketed this turquoise concession (1956-1984), and the Brown family has continued his work for generations. The Morenci mine is now closed and buried under tons of rock. The land was leeched with chemicals that would destroy any trace of turquoise, which means that there is never a chance to re-open this mine. The former miners of Morenci still have quite a stash of rough stone, enough to release a small amount every year to keep it available.
 
I will be listing a variety of colors and grades from this mine over time. 
Morenci turquoise is still available in limited quantities.

The small percent of available natural Morenci turquoise as well as it's history makes it valuable addition to any collection. There are times when the prices of turquoise will drop, but it is rare. My experience is that they consistently rise, due to supply and demand. The supply of good American turquoise continues to decrease.
Natural American turquoise is only a small percentage of the American turquoise sold on the world market today. Much of the current supply has been stabilized or enhanced due to the very limited quantity of good natural stone.
100% natural stones are the best investment choice a collector can make. 
Guarantee:
If the stone/stones do not completely fulfill your expectations, simply repackage them in the package I sent them to you in, put a new address label on the front and return to me for a refund of your purchase.
One More Note:
I have done my best to get the most accurate representation of the stone/stones. I have noticed that the photos look slightly different on different computers, and with different lighting, etc. I take the photos under natural light with a quality camera or iPhone and with no alterations. Other than cropping, you will find no color, clarity, or photo enhancements of any kind. I can assure you that the photographs do not do any stone true justice in my mind.
I am selling these from my personal collection. I have been a collector for most of my adult life. I have Native American jewelry, arts, crafts and a collection of turquoise stones from a variety of U.S. Mines.
Check my other items frequently. I will be adding to the inventory regularly.
Thank You!        ",137.50,4.972,"Vintage Supply

5083,Vintage porcelain figurine Home decor Chinese porcelain statuette Hand painted porcelain Asian figurines Asian decor Three Star Gods,"

Here is a tale of three Wise man or Star Gods:
According to various feng shui sources, the three feng shui god of wealth, or three immortals, have a variety of legends about them. One of the most popular one is based on the belief that the three Wise Men, also sometimes called the three Star Gods, were representation of specific celestials energies that are available for the benefit of humans. Let's look at the energies of each Wise Man - Fuk, Luk and Sau - individually.
The Chinese character Fuk means blessings of good luck, health and happiness. This is the wise man that is often depicted holding either a scroll, or a child. There is a popular belief that Fuk is the personification of planet Jupiter, with all its associated energy of good luck and auspiciousness. The child is there to symbolize the transmission of this good luck to future generations, and the scroll can be perceived as the importance of knowledge/learning.
The meaning of Luk character in imperial China was official's salary. It goes without saying that the energy of it is stability, fame and success, as well as financial abundance. Luk is often depicted holding either a ru yi, symbol of power and authority, or a golden ingot, a popular wealth symbol.
Sau means longevity. This is the wise old man that is usually depicted with a very high forehead and a warm smile on his face. He is holding a staff, as he is very old (thus the symbol of longevity). He is also holding a peach (considered a symbol of immortality).
The three wise men, or Fuk Luk Sau, are usually placed in an area with high visibility and good energy, such as a high table in the living room, for example, or on a high shelf in the office. It is thought to be disrespectful and bad feng shui to place Fuk Luk Sau on low surfaces, or in areas such as kitchen, bathroom or bedroom.
Fuk Luk Sau are always placed in a row in a specific order. To the left is always Fuk, with all the blessings and good luck energy. Luk is always in the center, with the promise of success and financial stability. Sau is to the right, smiling and offering the gifts of longevity and peaceful life.
Even though often called gods, the Fuk Luk Sau are not prayed to specifically, but they are always treated with enormous respect. You can see Fuk Luk Sau in most Chinese gift shops (look for the altar which is often in the back of the store), as well as restaurants, offices and homes. Daily incense burning, candles and fresh or artificial flowers are usually offered to these three wise men in hope of them bestowing their gifts on humans.
If you like this specific feng shui symbol, and especially if you are of Chinese origin and know all about it, then sure go for it! The symbol of these three gods can create beautiful and powerful energy in one's place, just be sure to buy this cure made of high quality materials.

            This is beautiful French antique fashion engraving from the Paris-based magazine 'La Mode Illustrée'. This particular engraving appeared in 1866 and is titled 'Toilettes de Mme Bréant-Castel'.  The beautiful fabric, beads and lace embellishments were added much later, probably the 50s/60s. 
There are signs of age, including a small tear on the engraving, mostly hidden by the pink dress, some dust spots and the frame has some tiny scuffs.  The backing paper is a little torn and I have added new masking tape to secure it.

6460,Police Baby Girl - Police Baby Shower - Police Officer Baby - Police Baby - Daddy Is My Hero - Cop Baby - Blue Line - Baby Bib Set -Baby Bib,"
            Need the perfect gift to a police officer's baby shower? This bib set will be adorable on the little future officer! Just imagine how cute feedings and meals will be for the parents with their new baby all decked out like Dad or Mom. Pair these with some bottles or bowls and spoons to make the ideal gift basket for any parent-to-be!
Whether just for catching drool or as they learn to eat those first soft foods, these bibs are as sturdy as they are adorable. Machine embroidered, they promise to stand up to many washings the way vinyl just can't. The bibs themselves are a soft knit, closing with Velcro for ultimate safety. 
A little about my process... 
A pre-washed knit bib is ironed, measured out and centered before being machine embroidered with quality thread. I use a cutaway backing which is a sturdy but soft stabilizer to keep the words from distorting, even after many washes. Once the embroidering is complete, I iron again to set the stitching. 
This bib is machine embroidered so it is completely washing machine, dryer and iron safe. Cause who has time to hang dry? 😉 
To order, just select which bib you'd like, or choose the set, and check out. Be sure to check the bib section of my shop for other officer designs!
Don't see what you need? Want one of these on a bodysuit instead? Send me a message and we can create it. 
Pair these bibs with the Police Officer Hooded Towel for the perfect baby shower gift! Find it here:

            MAXIMUM DELIVERY CHARGE IS 3.00 IN THE UK.  SEE BELOW FOR FULL LIST OF SCENTS AND OUR 'FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS'
 This listing is for a 'Olde Books' scented Roll-on Perfume 10ml.
Imagine leather books, stacked neatly on a dark-wooden book shelf. You open one and smell the leathery yet slightly fresh muskiness that comes from an old book. You wonder about the history of the book you hold, how many bookshelves has it sat on? How many hands have leafed through these pages? How many people have been inspired by the words contained within it? How many times has it been passed on through a family? Or found in a thrift shop, abandoned among other literary treasures, only to be brought home and loved all over again by someone new?
From a 'scent stand-point', old books are fascinating. They pick up all kinds of scents from the homes they have been in. This particular olde book has been around the block a few times! Battered and bruised, dog-eared and coffee stained. You will find notes of cedarwood, smokey vetiver, leather, coffee, black tea, green tea, earl grey (teas have been infused), capped off with a musky aroma.
A completely unisex fragrance.  Comes ready to gift.
To use: Shake well to disperse fragrance and roll on skin. 
Ingredients: fractionated coconut oil, essential oils, fragrance oils, jojoba oil, apricot kernel oil, avocado oil, vitamin e oil.
Our roll-on perfume is contained in 10ml glass bottles which have a roller-ball top, allowing for easy and convenient use. The great thing about roll-on perfume, is that you can use it anywhere, such as in the office or on the train, without annoying other people who might not want a blast of your perfume/spray in their face! You get to smell amazing without the dirty looks! 
Our perfume is made from only the purest ingredients and will last for an age if kept cool and out of direct sunlight.
Always perform a skin patch test.

            Label: Columbia ‎– CS 9482 
Format: Vinyl, LP, Album, Stereo 
Country: US 
Released: 1967 
Genre: Pop, Stage & Screen 
Style: Vocal 
-------- Near Mint
Mint [M]: Absolutely perfect in every way - certainly never played, possibly even still sealed. (More on still sealed below). Should be used sparingly as a grade, if at all. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Near Mint [NM or M-]: A nearly perfect record. Many dealers won't give a grade higher than this implying (perhaps correctly) that no record is ever truly perfect. The record shows no obvious sign of wear. A 45 rpm sleeve has no more than the most minor defects, such as almost invisible ring wear or other signs of slight handling. An LP jacket has no creases, folds, seam splits or any other noticeable similar defect. No cut-out holes, either. And of course, the same is true of any other inserts, such as posters, lyric sleeves, and the like. Basically, Near Mint looks as if you just got it home from a new record store and removed the shrink wrap. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Very Good Plus [VG]: Shows some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Record surfaces may show some slight signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don't affect one's listening experience. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are OK. The label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but is should be barely noticeable. The center hole is not misshapen by repeated play. Picture sleeves and LP inner sleeves will have some slight wear, lightly turn-up corners, or a slight seam-split. An LP jacket my have slight signs of wear also and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation or corner indicating it was taken out of print and sold at a discount. In general, if not for a couple of minor things wrong with it, this would be Near Mint. All but the most mint-crazy collectors will find a Very Good Plus record highly acceptable. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Very Good [VG]: Many of the defects found in a VG record are more pronounced in a VG disc. Surface noise is evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during the song's intro and fade, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as will light scratches deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound. Labels may be marred by writing, or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached. The same will be true of picture sleeves or LP covers. However, it will not have all of these problems at the same time, only two or three of them. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Good [G], Good Plus [G]: Good does not mean bad! A record in Good or Good Plus condition can be put onto a turntable and will play through without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise and scratches and visible groove wear. A jacket or sleeve has seam splits, especially at the bottom or on the spine. Tape, writing, ring wear or other defects will start to overwhelm the object. If it's a common item, you'll probably find another copy in better shape eventually. Pass it up. But if it's something you have been seeking for years, and the price is right, get it. 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Poor [P], Fair [F]: The record is cracked, badly warped, and won't play through without skipping or repeating. The picture sleeve is water damaged, split on all three seams and heavily marred by wear and/or writing. The LP jacket barely keeps the LP inside it. Inner sleeves are fully seam split, and written upon. Except for impossibly rare records otherwise unattainable, records in this condition should be bought or sold for no more than a        ",25.00,3.6667,"Vintage item from the 1960s

12466,"Bentwood ring, padouk wood ring with crushed malachite stone inlay","
            Hello,
This listing is for a ring made from padouk  wood and crushed malachite stone inlay.
The ring shown here is 6 mm wide but you can choose another width from the menu. It is coated with multiple layers of a high quality membrane glossy finish and a final Renaissance wax polish, witch makes it water proof, however I recommend avoiding excessive water contact (ex. when taking a shower /bath/dish washing) for a long lasting finish.
I believe that you are familiar with the bentwood rings and their advantages, and I promise you that the rings that i make are of good quality in terms of their resistance and aesthetics. This being said, if you like this ring, be confident that the one you order it will be made with good care and rigorously so the final result will satisfy your expectations. 
------------------------
Please read the Shipping & Policies informations before making a purchase. Also, if you want the ring/rings before a certain date, please contact me before so that we can decide if it will be possible to receive them in time.        ",88.83,5.0,"Handmade item

This is an original, exquisite ear cuffs.
Ear Cuff with czech glass beads, polymer rose and moonstone.
Beautiful decoration for your ear.
Cuff made of silver-plated wire jewelry with antioxidant coating. Wire does not darken.
Good fit for any ear. Ear Cuff is easy to put on and comfortable to wear. 
Decoration is made by hand from high-quality materials.
Ear cuffs are an ideal choice whether you have pierced ears or not. Begin by slipping the cuff around the top of your ear and slide it down to sit on the narrow portion of cartilage. You can mold them to fit your ear by gently squeezing or stretching the main section. They are so comfortable, you'll forget you're wearing them! Can be worn with or without your other earrings.
Wonderful option if you don't have pierced ears or your ears are sensitive. MUCH more comfortable than standard clip ons!
Please note that each piece is truly handmade and your piece may slightly differ from the one in the photo.
Real colors may slightly differ from one monitor to another, as it depends on specific monitor settings.
