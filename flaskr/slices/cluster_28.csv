12,"VOGUE Ginny Doll head moves, eyes open and close Walking Ginny Doll Brown hair Ginny Blue eye Ginny Doll Vintage Ginny","
            Here is a precious Vogue Ginny Doll!! She has long brown hair and blue eyes she stands approx. 7 inches tall. As you move her legs to walk her head turns from side to side, she does have the eyes that open and close, although they do not open and close on their own. I think at one time they probably did, but now you manually have to close them when you lay her down. The back of her head is stamped Vogue. On her back she is stamped with Ginny Vogue dolls Inc. Pat. No. and Made in U.S.A. She is in great used condition for her age, she does come with a dress, little matching jacket and scarf, these items appear to be handmade.  
Although we are not going to require it insurance is HIGHLY recommended for this doll!!

819,Vintage Cameo Pendant Mythological Three Graces Carved Lucite Necklace Reproduction,"
            This is just so incredible.  Lovely Mythological Three Graces Carved Lucite Cameo Pendant.
The lucite center is from the 1970's.  The setting itself is newer.  The Three graces named Euphrosyne, Aglaea and Thalia were daughters of the Greek God Zues.  
They represent beauty, charm and joy and presided over banquets and gatherings primarily to entertain the guests and other Gods.  
This lovely pendant includes a simple 18""  Gold plated chain.  
Please Note: Lace Edge Settings are becoming hard to come by. It is possible your setting may be substituted for a equally beautiful setting.
Measures approx. 1 3/4"" tall x 1 1/4"" wide 
Will be wrapped in a gift box with ribbon.

            Vintage 1960s pair of khaki tan riding pants (or jodhpurs), made by Exclusive Riding Apparel for Christenfeld. 
There is no content label, but the fabric feels like cotton with some elastane (spandex). These equestrian pants have a side zipper, and a high waist band. There are slash pockets at the front waist and no back pockets. There are large matching patches at the inner knees that reinforce the area.
They flare at the ankles, and inside there are buttoned-in elastic straps that create stirrups. These make it easy to slip in and out of riding boots without your pants scrunching up! The fit is flattering and comfortable.
They fit like an extra small or small - please compare the measurements below to a garment that fits you well in order to ensure a perfect fit.

    Amber (Lith. gintaras), found on the Baltic Sea shores, was and is highly treasured and is the national gem of Lithuania. It is a fossil resin  which came from the sap of  several varieties of pines.
    Baltic amber is usually of a yellow, honey-like color, but may occur in many shades from pale yellow to dark brown. White pieces with a yellowish or bony tint are rare, and reddish, bluish and greenish tinted pieces are very rare. Some pieces of Baltic amber are transparent and clear, and others are cloudy and opaque.
    Pain relief is one of the main reasons people use Baltic amber. Though the resin itself isn't a painkiller, its succinic acid is believed to have analgesic properties that take the edge off of pain. Baltic amber has been used to alleviate all types of pain, from mild to severe. People have used Baltic amber to ease carpal tunnel syndrome, lessen back pain, alleviate menstrual cramps, ease arthritis, soothe migraine headaches, and help alleviate a baby's teething pains. Baltic amber may even restore energy, strengthen the immune system and promote general wellness. The salt of succinic acid may play an active role in cellular respiration and intercellular creation of energy.

They don’t get as much use as when I lived in Vermont but they are my go to pants for winter outdoor activities. (Okay, I’m bragging, but they still fit!)

- The cinched in waist accentuates an hour glass figure. 
- Has a draping neckline that is so sophisticated. This dress reminds me of something Grace Kelly would have worn.

            Old brown leather bag from the 1900s
Its shape is reminiscent of the old doctor bags but the inside of the bag is designed to receive useful utensils for travel.
The stainless steel clasps are in good condition and function. Note: the key supplied does not close the bag but goes into the lock.
The frame is painted and patina of origin.
The handle is in the state of wear of the time (see for yourself on the pictures! Other pictures are available if you wish)
The inside of the bag is totally in light brown leather in very good condition.
Very good general condition given its age!
This travel accessory of old perfectly harmonizes with today's decoration.

            DISCOUNT!!!  BUY YOUR OWN SHADE AND SAVE!!  Buy your own shade and save 7.75 off the regular price! You also save 2.00 off the shipping because it fits in a smaller box!
                                             SHADE NOT INCLUDED!!!
This handmade lamp features a lovely genuine vintage blue mason jar in the quart size.  I have added a double bulb fixture .  One bulb lights the inside of the vintage jar, and the other the shade.  Each light works independently of the other, so you can use both, or light the jar alone.  The bulb inside the jar makes for a nice subtle light, or night light.  The last photo shows the lamp with only the jar bulb lit.  The lamp turns on and off with a switch on the cord and a toggle switch for the top bulb.  The lamp measures 15"" tall with a 5 foot long cord.  All components are UL approved, light bulbs are included.

8320,Sea Turtle in Shell,"
            We saw a nest {aka: clutch} of sea turtle eggs at the beach last night. They're protected by law so you can't touch them so I thought it would be fun to make crocheted baby turtles that kids can play with.
These cute baby sea turtles are great to decorate with or give as gifts. I make three options:
1) Turtle  Hatched Egg COMBO - Baby Turtle is hatching from his egg! This combo is one baby sea turtle and one hatched egg. Your kids will have a blast putting the turtle in and out of the egg! 
2) Baby Sea Turtle - This little guy melted my 9 year old brother's heart and my 5 & 7 year old sisters always want to play with him. My baby brother likes to hold him, too. I can make the turtles to order in a variety of colors- see the photo for some yarn color options..
3) Unhatched Egg - This egg is crocheted as a whole egg and stuffed with polyfill. Buy one or several to show a turtle's nest. Sea turtles lay an average of 110 eggs in a clutch... you can pick how many you'd like in your collection.
**Please note: The ""Unhatched Egg"" option does not come with a baby turtle.**        ",6.00,4.8462,"Handmade item

8960,Straight Razor Cut Throat Razor Krusius Brothers German 6/8,"
            Here is a fine German razor from the Krusius Brothers. Razor aficionados love blades made by these guys because of the wonderful steel's ability to hold an edge for a long time. This razor has been keeping its edge long before I was born and is still sharp. Meanwhile, I'm already losing my edge. 
 Ladies, competitive swimmers, and whoever else, don't rule this razor out for your legs and wherever else hair grows. It will give you the closest shave possible.
The blade has a straight cutting edge, and is free of chips, or cracks. There is minor surface staining on the steel, but I would not classify it as pitting. The only thing I did to clean this razor was hand rubbing with Simichrome polish. The scales (handle) are in wonderful unbroken condition. This razor appears to only need some light sharpening to be ready to mow your face, legs, or wherever hair removal is needed. If you plan on shaving with this check out http://straightrazorplace.com/ for everything you need to know about shaving with a razor like this.
The cutting edge is 2 7/8 inches long and the blade is 3/4 inches wide with a square (spike) point.        ",62.00,4.8571,"Vintage item

9177,"SPINos tray, spin station, a spinning tray for you spin tops!","
            This is about the spinning tray of SPINos.
You can use it as a spinning station for all your spinning tops.
*************
It is common that Spinning Top lovers will use a magnifying mirror as a Spinning station for their spins, we have come to a conclusion that our Stainless steel disk tray is better than the mirror or glass, because of the steeper concave curve. This leads the Top to take stable  position faster than the glass and thus resulting in longer spin times!!!
So go ahead and give it a try after all it is a bargain!!!
*************
SPINos is a unique spin top toy that works in combination with a wine cork.
It can be a fun conversation piece at your dinner table as it can provide endless pleasure and excitement! The stainless steel spinning tray of SPINos can also be utilized as a vessel to place your cork while wine-tasting.
SPINos is made out of solid brass, a metal that ages beautifully, as wine does. Over time, the metal will develop a unique patina. If you wish, you may polish the brass to restore the original shine. 
Please note that small nicks in the surface of the spin top are a part of the normal use and wear—these are markers of a spin top used well and often, not a defect in the product.
The name SPINos derives from the combination of the two words: Spin and Oinos (wine in Greek)

11020,A Court of Thorns and Roses Decal,"
            This decal is based on the ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" book series. Made out of 651 or 751 Oracal vinyl, this decal will last for years, is easy to apply and comes in a variety of colors. This design is made to order and if you'd like it in a color or size not listed, just request a custom order and I will do everything possible to meet your specifications. 
Both vinyls are glossy and rated for indoor and outdoor use. Here are some basic differences to help you decide which one is right for you:
Oracal 651
-can be used outdoors up to 6 years
-recommended for indoor use or customizing phones, laptops, or etc...
Oracal 751
-outdoor use for 8 years- black and white, 7 years- all other colors
-thinner than Oracal 651
-easier to apply to curved or uneven surfaces
-can be used on glassware/tumblers, just make sure to hand wash

11254,Stunning vintage men's 9ct gold Claddagh ring,"
            A stunning vintage 9ct yellow gold men's Claddagh ring in excellent condition 
Fully hallmarked and professionally cleaned and polished this looks superb 
Written on the back of the band are the words .....
'With my two hands I give you my heart and crown it with my love'
Usage and symbolism
The Claddagh's distinctive design features two hands clasping a heart and usually surmounted by a crown. These elements symbolize the qualities of love (the heart), friendship (the hands), and loyalty (the crown). A ""Fenian"" Claddagh ring, without a crown, is a slightly different take on the design but has not achieved the level of popularity of the crowned version. Claddagh rings are relatively popular among the Irish and those of Irish heritage, such as Irish Americans, as cultural symbols and as friendship, engagement and wedding rings.

PRODUCT - Unless stated 'MADE AND READY TO SHIP' all of our items are made to order. Occasionally there are some flowers that are no longer available from our suppliers or there are small variations in colours. The result is that there may be slight variations in our re-designs.

16999,14Kt Gold and Diamond Ring Guard ring enhancer Wedding Band size 5.25,"
            A vintage 14kt yellow gold ring guard/enhancer with 2 sparkling diamonds.
Perfect for wearing with a diamond or other gemstone solitaire ring, it has two 3 mm diamonds each set with four prongs with a curved 5 mm space in between them. It would go best with a solitaire no larger than 3/4 carat, depending on the setting.
It measures 3 1/6ths of an inch across the band at each diamond and the band is about 1.5 mm in the back.
Diamonds have been tested as genuine. I'm not a diamond grader, but except for needing a good cleaning, they're sparkling and bright with no eye-visible inclusions or defects. I had a local jeweler test the diamonds and he said he would retail the ring for 200 to 250. I got it for a good price at an estate sale, so you're getting a good deal too. :) 
Ring is marked PWJ 14K.
Weight is 1.4 dwt.
Shipping is USPS Priority shipping with insurance and delivery confirmation you will have to sign for and is to USA only.

------------------------------------
★ Please NOTE -- these are all completely hand forged from scratch and each one is made to order. Considerable loving care is given in each creation. We pride ourselves on the quality and the fact that we start with raw sheet metal and transform them into art. Each letter is individually hand engraved; each hammer stroke is struck by hand. It gets very loud in our studio but we love it! They are works of heart! From our heart to yours! Made in our sweet studio in the USA by women who love what we do.
★SIZING DETAILS★
------------------------------------
We offer two sizes. Standard, which fits most wrists, at a 6.5"" circumference . Large at a circumference of 7"". These are CUFFS, not bangles. There is an opening in the back of 1"". Cuffs are meant to bend and pinch down to suit the size of your wrist and they are meant to fit snugly.
★METAL DETAILS★
------------------------------------
We use the following metals in our custom cuffs: German Silver, Nu Gold and Copper. Do read about the metal content in our products please see our policies section for a breakdown of what's in all of our metals.
★FINISH DETAILS★
------------------------------------
★POLISHED will come straight out of the tumbler and not be sprayed. It will be bright and sparkly but will age (or tarnish) more readily. If you want them to stay bright and sparkly, you might consider purchasing a polish cloth: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/113672883/beautiful-and-safe-polishing-cloth-to
★BRUSHED will still be tumbled for hours but will receive a final brushing before being sent off to you. The brushed look is more subdued than polished and gives the typical clean brush lines. It will be beautifully brushed but it will age (or tarnish) more readily. If you want them to stay just like they are when they arrive you might consider a polish cloth: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/113672883/beautiful-and-safe-polishing-cloth-to
★SATIN CLEAR GUARD will still be tumbled for hours but will receive a coating of our Eco-friendly clear guard SATIN spray. This low VOC, environmentally friendly spray helps to guard against sun, salts, heat, water and tarnish. Though it won't last forever, it will still give a beautiful SATIN (bright and blingy) coating and help to stave off the aging effect if you are not partial to that.
★MATTE CLEAR GUARD will still be tumbled for hours but will receive a coating of our Eco-friendly clear guard MATTE spray. This low VOC, environmentally friendly spray helps to guard against sun, salts, heat, water and tarnish. Though it won't last forever, it will still give a beautiful matte coating and help to stave off the aging effect if you are not partial to that.
These beautiful cuffs come ready to gift on a handmade card with descriptive text on the piece and a hand-written note of inspiration in a beautiful chocolate brown organza bag.

MATERIALS
GOLD-FILLED JEWELRY:
- Under normal wearing conditions and with proper care, your gold filled jewelry should last at least 10 years.
- 14kt Gold-Filled jewelry is made by bonding a solid layer of 14kt gold on top of another metal, but this layer is 1000 - 10,000 times thicker than gold plating, resulting in a durable, long-lasting product that looks gorgeous like solid gold.
- Gold-Filled jewelry can also be worn by people with sensitive skin.
STERLING SILVER:
- We use .925 Sterling Silver, which requires polishing from time to time from oxidation. You can easily restore silver back to shine with a polishing cloth or use a polishing lotion for that extra shine.
---------------------------------
GIFT PURPOSES
- If this is a gift, we can also send the jewelry piece to the recipient. Please simply put down the recipient's address as the shipping address when you checkout.
- We can also include a little card with a message for you inside- Let us know in the ""Note to Seller"" section when you check out.

18717,Custom Back to the future 2 Air Mag illumination Boot Strap EL Panels.,"
            Kit consists of: 2 x Custom made 24mm x 44mm EL panels with Nike Logo Imprinted directly onto the EL Panel.
These panels are to be used as a conversion for the Nike Air Mag V2 replica boot.
This conversion will require some crafting skill as the original boot strap will need to be parted using a Hairdryer or Heat Gun and the original Nike panel cut out using a Craft knife so the EL panel can be glued in its place.
There is a good tutorial on You Tube about Nike Air Mag V2 Conversions, search JediFyfe, he specialises in such conversions.
We supply the EL panels only, the power source for the EL panels can be wired from the Lithium battery in the sole of the Nike Air Mag V2 as described by JediFyfe on You tube or powered externally by plugging in a micro power pack such as a CR2032 Coin Cell Inverter.
Any questions about crafting the conversion or selecting power source please email me and i will help you out, i have done this conversion a few times so am pretty good at it.        ",17.91,4.6923,"Handmade item

Slippers are made of natural sheep wool. Soft, cozy and original. 
The sole is rubber or latex - non-slip.
All items are 100% handmade, made with love! I use only water and soap, all work is done by hand.
All slippers are made according to foot measurements so they all are individual. All you need is take your foot dimensions. When ordering, specify the foot size of the baby. The measurement results if necessary ,add 1 cm (margin for growth legs).
Please note that computer monitor can shift colors - real colors may slightly differ from their appearance on your display.
Care
Slippers can be washed by hand in warm soapy water up to 30°C or 86 F. Gentle rub the surface and wrap in a towel, dry gently pressing and reshape with hands or on your feet.
Slippers are made to order, it takes about 3-5 days, from the date of order plus delivery period /- 3 weeks.
