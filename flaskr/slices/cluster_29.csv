            THis sketch Mickey is one of our all time best sellers AND we finally found MINNIE!!  
Also note that we are using the Disney Font on these instead of the sketch font.
**ORDERING**
Please include in the comments section upon checkout, specifics for EACH shirt
Shirt color-
Shirt size-
Name-
Mickey or Minnie (flower, red bow, pink bow)-
***SIZING**
Please see our sizing chart in the 4th picture - we are unfortunately NO HELP in sizing since we have a 5'8"" 15yo girl and 3'1"" 14 yo boy (with dwarfism).  With 5 kids with dwarfism I just no longer have there reference for ""normal"" sizing and went to great lengths to make sure you had the measurements you needed to make the decision on size easier.
Our mens and youth shirts run pretty true to size.
The LADIES shirt does run about 1 size small - please see measurements in the 4th picture.
Our shirts are a buttery soft fabric that will NOT shrink. 
These are our performance shirts - they are lightweight, breathable, moisture wicking and have antimicrobial features.  The white tends to be a little more see through.
We offer these in GREY and WHITE
(these white shirts are a little thin and see through so we do recommend grey)
We can ONLY get onesie's and toddler in WHITE  If you order one of these we will make and send the white.
**HOWEVER, if you need a 3T or larger there is a minimal difference (like 1/2 inch) in size between the 3T and the XS which does come in grey**
In addition, we use a vapor and heat process which adds our design directly to the fibers of the shirt.  This prevents our designs from fading AND there is no weird feeling to the shirt where our design is located.  Our sensory kids love these shirts and are NOT constantly distracted like they are with vinyl or embroidered shirts.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We try our best to print and have your shirt out in the mail immediately (as in next day)!  PLEASE include the date you need your shirt by in the comments along with your child's name and any other special information!
PLEASE NOTE ~ computer screens differ from person to person.  We try to provide the most accurate colors in our listing but they may appear slightly different in person.  Our process DOES make for a colorful and vibrant shirt when printed on a WHITE shirt - and what we recommend for most of our t-shirts.  We know that white isn't everyone's favorite but we looked long and hard for a shirt that would stand up to kid's wear.  We do OFFER a grey t-shirt BUT it will show through the design as our process actually embed's INTO the fiber and doesn't sit on top!  Our t-shirt's are a performance tee that feels like cotton.  Although we strive for 100% satisfaction - we will not give refund's for any of the above normal variation's.        ",14.99,4.8182,"Handmade item

Perfect for any special occasion. 
""The meaning of moonstone is closely tied to the moon. Just like the moon influences the earth and its inhabitants so does the moonstone. It has been used as a stone of protection for travelers all over the world.
It is mostly know as a stone for lovers however, it is said that if you give your lover a moonstone or a piece of moonstone jewelry that the passion you share will be eternal.
Moonstone meaning
The powers of the moonstone are deeply linked to the moon itself, focusing on love, fertility, good fortune and protection during dark times.
This ancient gemstone has been in use for thousands of years all over the world. From Ancient Rome, India and China to Middle Age Europe, it has always held an important position.
As it is a stone of love and fertility it was often used as a wedding gift or as a token of eternal love. In some traditional communities in India and the Middle-East it is still very common to present newly-weds with a moonstone.
The use as a stone of protection of travelers was also widespread, though it is hardly used for this purpose today. Which is a shame, because the reason it was used by travelers is that it would protect them not just during dark nights, but dark times in general.
With the advent of electric lighting dark nights were a thing of the past, but as we all know, dark times unfortunately are not. So if you want or need a bit of extra protection in tough times a moonstone is a good option.
To get the most out of your moonstone it should be used during an almost full or full moon. This will energize your moonstone and enhance its powers.
Moonstone is a traditional birthstone of June, alongside pearls.
Moonstone Meaning: Legends and Myths
Most of the legends and myths surrounding the moonstone focus on its connection to the moon. In particular its connection to moon goddesses like Selene, Diana and Nyx.
In many myths moonstones are either pieces of the moon itself or frozen tears that fell after a moon goddess had a lovers quarrel. Another reason why moonstones are thought to help people reconcile after they have had a fight.

A stone for “new beginnings”, Moonstone is a stone of inner growth and strength. It soothes emotional instability and stress, and stabilizes the emotions, providing calmness. Moonstone enhances intuition, promotes inspiration, success and good fortune in love and business matters.
Moonstone aids the digestive system, assimilates nutrients, eliminates toxins and fluid retention, and alleviates degenerative conditions of skin, hair, eyes, and fleshy organs such as the liver and pancreas. It stimulates the pineal gland and balances hormonal cycles, being excellent for PMS, conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and breast-feeding. Moonstone is also beneficial to men in opening the emotional self.

3186,1940s Singer Buttonholer Attachment 121795 in Original Box,"
            1940s Singer Buttonholer Attachment 121795 in Original Box
Aficionados of vintage Singer products are likely already familiar with Singer's patented all-in-one 'Buttonholers' from the 50s/60s with their modern plastic cases and visually appealing hardware. But before all that, buttonholing was less about marketing and more about functionality. Which is why this early-edition buttonholer from the late 1930's/early 40's somehow appears nude. Yet it performs the same duties; one still had to affix this piece to an appropriate Singer sewing machine just like any other. While this early model isn't the prettiest attachment, its advent certainly revolutionized buttonholing. 
Buttonholer comes with its original green & white box. Side of box reads, ""Sold by Singer Sewing Machine Company"" while the end reads, ""Made in U.S.A. Singer Buttonhole Attachment No. 121795. For Singer Lock Stitch Family Sewing Machines"". On the buttonholer itself is engraved ""SINGER U.S.A. 121795 COMPLETE"".
NOTES: Feed cover plate (and clamping screw) IS included. Original 1940s instruction booklet is NOT included, but we threw in a newer-model instruction booklet instead.
CONDITION: Box exhibits appropriate signs of age (fading, wear, etc) but otherwise intact and holding up well. There's a sticker/tape attached to the box top which we didn't try to remove. The stainless steel buttonholer hardware has no rust/pitting or oxidation (like new) and all four wingnuts are still present.        ",19.00,4.8571,"Vintage item from the 1940s

            I purchased this lovely antique slip at an estate sale of a 90 year old woman. I'm not sure if it belonged to her or her children but could date anywhere from the 20's through the 40's.
The slip is handmade in lightweight cream colored cotton. There is a bit of trim at the neckline and hem. It features floral embroidery on the chest. There are two buttons at the back. 
The slip is currently hemmed about 1 1/2- 2 inches but could easily be let down. 
The dress is in very good and very wearable condition considering the age, but there are several rust colored spots. 
There are no size tags, so please verify measurements to ensure a proper fit.

            Vintage Gucci bag, Made in Italy
A classic leather and vinyl Gucci bag with an adjustable strap, easily transforming this from a shoulder to a crossbody bag, goes with pretty much everything
Bag has one big compartment, 1 interior zipped pocket, 1 front zipped pocket. 
WIDTH (Across): 10, 5 inches
HEIGHT : 6,5 inches
Strap drop - goes up to 21,5 inches
CONDITION: This is a preowned item, has been worn a lot and has multiple signs of wear:
     - Bag has visible wear on the corners (zoom in 2nd photo)
     - Spots on the leather ( mostly on the leather strap and the bottom of the bag)
     - the leather tag with the Gucci logo inside has separated on the back
     - Inside is peeling off (typical for some vintage Gucci bags as the fabric the bags were lined back then had some sort of waterproof layer that tends to peel off with age). Might need professional cleaning to get that problem fixed!!! Zoom in 3rd photo
Most of those issues though only add to that cool distressed vintage look, there's still plenty of life in it. Zippers work perfectly, gucci tag on the zipper is still there, no holes or tears on the leather! Overall good vintage condition        ",82.00,4.8485,"Vintage item

7813,Weighted Blanket 10-15 lbs,"
            This blanket is 40"" x 60"" and is available in weights from 10 lbs to 15 lbs and the following colors: Royal Blue, Silver Grey, Crimson Red, Turquoise, Aqua and Lilac. Other colors are available upon request.
We use a National Courier Broker to get the best shipping costs and Etsy's Mailing System to provide the best mailing costs for our customers. We do not charge a handling fee or add any additional charges. Please include your phone number when placing your order as we must provide it to the courier when making a shipment.
Our Windsor, Ontario company is proud of the excellent products which we offer at affordable prices. All of our products consist of FOUR LAYERS of top quality poly cotton fabric for durability and we use a UNIQUE REINFORCING STITCH on the majority of  seams for longevity. We use only VIRGIN food-grade hypo-allergenic poly pellets with smooth edges.  We never use recycled pellets.  The weight of the poly pellets is evenly distributed throughout the pockets. All of our products are machine washable using a gentle cycle and a low to medium heat setting for drying.
Poly/cotton blended products combine the softness of cotton with the durability of polyester. The combination of cotton and polyester results in a dense weave that tends to keep its shape and color. It is not prone to wrinkling, and does not shrink. The cotton component makes it more comfortable than products made solely of polyester. Blended products generally cost less and last longer than 100% cotton. That enables us to pass these savings on to our customers.
The recommended weight formula for a weighted blanket is 10% of an individual’s weight plus 1 lb. For example, a 60 lb person would use a 7 lb blanket. We are not qualified to advise anyone about the weight they should have other than the recommended weight that is standard in the industry. There are OT specialists who assess individuals with sensory disorders to determine their ideal weight. There are OT Associations throughout North America. In Canada, you could contact The Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists for assistance: www.caot.ca
Weighted blankets are therapeutically beneficial. They have helped individuals with a multitude of neurological disorders such as:
Autism Spectrum Disorder 
Sensory processing disorder (SPD)
Restless legs syndrome (RLS)
Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD, PDD-NOS)
Anxiety disorders
Bi-polar
Schizophrenia
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Fibromyalgia
Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI)
Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
Insomnia and other sleeping disorders
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
Dr. Temple Grandin was diagnosed with autism in 1950. She graduated from university and to this day, she is a prominent author and world-renowned autism spokesperson. 
While she was looking into ways to treat her own anxiety, she discovered the benefits of pressure as a way to calm her overstimulated nervous system.  She created a squeeze machine for herself, which gave her relief due to the deep pressure stimulation.  Researchers and clinicians have adapted the idea into weighted blankets.  Research has found that deep pressure stimulation releases seratonin, a neurotransmitter that creates the feeling of calm and converts to melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep. There are no negative effects of leaving a weighted blanket on for long periods of time.
CARE INSTRUCTIONS:
Machine wash separately in warm or cold water using a gentle cycle.
Machine dry using a low to medium heat setting.
Commercial or extra capacity machines are recommended for blankets weighing more than 15 lbs.
Do not iron. 
NEVER put weighted blankets in the microwave or oven. 
Do not dry clean. 
WARNING: Weighted blankets should never be used on infants or people who do not have the ability or strength to remove the blanket from their face or head.
Please DO NOT allow your weighted blanket to be available to your pets as chewing and clawing can cause the blanket to tear and expose the pellets.
WARRANTY:
It is not possible to have an accurate color match when the reproduction is done electronically, and/or when different dye lots are used. Therefore, we are not responsible if the actual fabric color is different from the picture(s) shown. 
We stand behind the quality and workmanship of our products. Please remember that the seller is not responsible for abuse or misuse of these items.
Our weighted products are custom made so refunds are not normally possible, unless the order is incorrect because of size, weight, fabric or color errors. 
We will replace any item which is damaged during transit, providing you ship the damaged item complete with its damaged packaging back to us within 3 days of receiving it.

I’ve been wearing this for a year now (as of March 2016) and I haven’t had it leave marks on any of my clothes.
During the summer months, this may melt if kept in a hot place. Please be aware of when your mail arrives.
This is not an antiperspirant. If your body is used to store bought brands that do contain aluminum, your body may take awhile to get used to the aluminum free recipe. You may need to reapply on hot days and days with higher activity. 
If any irritation occurs, stop use. You may need to test in a small area first.
If your deodorant turns a brown color, it does not mean it has gone bad, it is a reaction to the vanilla properties of the fragrance. It will still work just fine and has not gone bad.

❤❤❤❤❤And see all the cards I've made so far: http://www.stephanieparcus.com/cards/
HOW DOES THIS WORK? 
I'll make the card in 5-10 days and send you the digital files, so you can check and see if you like the results. If there will be anything to change, I do all the revisions for free until it's perfect. 
Color: White, Blue, Black, Red, Green, Gold
Mana Cost: How many for each color and how many colorless?
Supertype: Legendary, Basic, Snow, World, Ongoing

Subtype: Anything you want to describe what it is! ie unicorn, goblin, troll, cleric, etc

Flavor: It's the sentence in Italic that says something interesting, epic, meaningful or simply funny, about the character.
Power/Toughness (attack and defense values): example 2/2, 1/4, 3/3 are medium values, but you can get crazy with 10/10 if you want!
♪♪ HOW IS THE CARD BUILT ♪♪
The front of the card is printed on a thin special paper called high resolution paper. It will be inserted together with a real card inside a transparent card sleeve. See the video linked above to verify the final results!
♪♪ ILLUSTRATION REQUIREMENTS: ♪♪
You can choose the pose and the background, send me a private message to tell me your preferences and don't forget to send some pictures!
I am currently in Italy and will create the digital files here, but for speeding up the shipping time a friend of mine will print and assemble the letter in Colorado! He prints EVERY SUNDAY and it can take from 2-8 days to arrive to your house, depending where you are in the States!
Orders to Europe will be mailed by myself, from Italy!

9573,Batman Emergency Batarangs Wallmount Display,"
            Just what any Batman fan needs; an emergency set of Batarangs! Perfect for any injustice you might come into contact within your home or office! 
These 3 Batarangs come in a shadow box display. The display's face opens with a hinge and with a magnet keeping it closed, so it can easily open without taking it off the wall. The box itself measures about 12"" x 10"" x 2"". The display case can be hung on the wall or displayed on a desk or bookcase (it has a stand).
The three batarangs are made of Stainless Steel with a black oxide surface process. They each measure about 6 inches wide and about 2 inches high.
*WARNING: The batarangs are sharp. The purpose of this 'Batman Emergency Batarangs Wallmount"" is purely for display and not crime fighting, leave that to the professionals (like Batman). This is just a fun novelty to show your love for Batman and justice. As far as throwing them against a tree or something, I'm sure they would dull and tarnish with time making them not as much fun to display.*
The batarangs will come packed in a nylon bag.
This is the perfect gift for any Batman fan! And the perfect addition to any Man Cave (or Bat Cave)!

FILL INFORMATION
Corn:
Corn is perishable. Store in a cool, dry area and away from insects and rodents. Allow bags to thoroughly dry if they get wet/damp. Corn dust is an awesome and truly genuine part of game play! It is formed as corn breaks down so over time the bags may begin to feel less full. We also offer plastic pellet fill as an alternative to the original corn fill.
All Weather:
Perfect for playing by the pool, the river, and at the beach! Also, a must have for camping trips unless you enjoy feeding the critters! Our plastic pellet fill does not break down the way corn does so your bags will have a longer life span. We go to great lengths to ensure our fill is as close to the size and weight ratio of corn as we can get it.        ",31.98,4.9467,"Handmade item

11609,Worldwide – Antiquarian Tarot Guidebook,"
            GUIDEBOOK ONLY. 
This listing is for INTERNATIONAL BUYERS of the Antiquarian Tarot Companion Guidebook only.  Please be sure to read the Shipping Note below!
If you are in the USA and want the book, please see the listing in the shop with the tarot deck for USA ORDERS. Thanks!
ABOUT THE BOOK
The Antiquarian Companion Guidebook has 396 pages with a wonderfully tactile silk laminate cover. If you are a tarot novice, it will be a great introductory primer. If you are a seasoned reader, the book offers information about the cards that you may be interested in. It includes images and details about all of the cards. You can see the Table of Contents here: http://www.divinemuses.net/divinemusings/update-antiquarian-tarot-companion-guidebook  
The initial inspiration for the Antiquarian Tarot deck was the Albano-Waite Tarot.  The principles of the Antiquarian Tarot are based on the Waite-Smith deck combined with Paul Foster Case's work, which form the foundation of the Albano-Waite deck. 
Much of the modern occult wisdom was passed down through the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which scores of decks & books have drawn from. My knowledge pulls from this, as well as Hindu philosophy. Paul Foster Case also studied Hindu philosophy and that may be why I was so drawn to his work. My guidebook is largely based on the sacred tarot and occult mysticism, with some Hindu philosophy sprinkled throughout. My work leans more toward the English style of tarot and mysticism, as opposed to the French style of reading the cards.  
BOOK SIZE: 4.25"" x 7"" x 1"" (108mm x 178mm x 25mm), 396 pages, silk laminate cover.
To see more photos of this guidebook please see the Gallery on divineMuses.net.
SHIPPING NOTE:
INTERNATIONAL ORDERS: (If your country is not listed here, please contact me for a shipping quote. Thanks.) 
ONE BOOK ONLY: Shipped via USPS First Class International Package Service. Books will be shrink-wrapped (or bubble-wrapped) and mailed in a padded envelope. Please note: if you are also ordering the tarot deck, it will be shipped separately. 
Unfortunately, I CANNOT COMBINE SHIPPING costs of the book and tarot deck. These will have two shipping costs because they are being shipped from two different locations. (The tarot deck is printed on demand and shipped by a professional playing card company.)
It is very expensive to ship this book overseas! USPS is charging 23 to the UK, EU & Australia and 16 to Canada. I had no idea how expensive it would be to ship! This is because the book is 1"" (22mm) thick and weighs 13 ounces. Basically, if a padded envelope is thicker than 3/4"" (19mm) USPS considers it a ""package"" and charges as such. I apologize for this obscene shipping cost, but it is what the United States Postal Service charges. I almost did not offer this book worldwide, but due to some interest, I'm offering it for the time being on Etsy. Please know that I am not overcharging shipping. It is just what it costs to ship this overseas. 
If you want more than one book, please contact me and I will be happy to arrange a shipping price quote for you. 
Please be aware of your import laws & how long it takes for packages to clear customs in your country. Orders shipped internationally may be subject to customs and/or VAT fees and are the responsibility of the buyer. 
Thank you!

Shipping Policy:
Your book will be well taken care of after the transaction is complete. I first seal the book in a plastic bag to protect it from dust and water, then do this neat packaging that will leave you a little nostalgic. The last step is to seal the book in a bubble wrapped package. I treat each book with the most love possible. 
Return Policy:
If you're not happy with the book, please contact me on Etsy or my email (TheDeadTreeSociety@gmail.com) and we'll get the return process started.

This stunning braided pearl cuff is photographed here in ivory and light gold pearl (also available in white and gray and silver).

This bracelet features a sterling silver adjustable clasp, but if you would like to have it gold tone, no problem, just put it in the notes to seller in your purchase! 
This bracelet also has a matching necklace available for purchase at this listing:

OTHER IMPORTANT INFO
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
The original labels definitely look best removed and it’s pretty simple to do!  A very thorough set of instructions are included with each order.  When choosing wine for your fab new labels, be sure to choose bottles that are perfectly symmetrical for the length of the label. Cabernet shaped bottles are best because they are typically long, symmetrical Bordeaux bottles. Merlot, Pinot Grigio, etc. are also good choices. Many Riesling bottles, for instance, are curvy and tricky to apply.
Please read shop “Policies” for more information.
Sadly wine is not included. This listing is for custom labels only.
A gift not soon forgotten! Happy Wedding Planning!

            This Murano glass dip pen is a wonderful gift for writers. Beautiful and easy to use, the pen writes with a smooth, consistent line. The glass tip holds a surprising amount of ink---enough for a short paragraph with each dip. No more dipping several times per sentence!
Each pen is approximately 7 inches long and fits comfortably in the hand. Three styles are available: (1) Red and yellow marbled pen with round grip and spiral-twisted tip, (2) Blue / gold stripe with square grip and straight tip, and (3) Black and gold twist with spiral-twisted tip. This listing is for ONE pen in the style of your choice.
Each one is shipped in a padded box, safe and secure. Use it with any type of ink designed for dip pens, including the inks listed in our shop (https://www.etsy.com/shop/ArteOfTheBooke?ref=hdr_shop_menu&section_id=12644893 ). Ink and inkwell are available separately.
Of course, because the pen is glass and therefore breakable, we do not recommend this for young children.        ",19.00,4.9429,"Craft type: Calligraphy, Card making & stationery, Drawing & drafting

Geopathic stress and shungite
         Shungite  appears to be a perfect solution when it comes to coping with geopathic stress. Geopathic stress is a distorted or disrupted electromagnetic field of the Earth (Schumann Resonance / Waves - 7.83Hz ). Many things like underground streams, sewers, water pipes, electricity networks, tunnels and underground railways, mineral formations and geological faults distort the natural resonance of the Earth and lead to creation of geopathic stress (GS). People sleeping or spending a lot of time in geopathic stress zones are very vulnerable and are ill effected on their health, performance and wellbeing.
         How can we define whether geopathic stress affects us?
1) never waking up feeling refreshed or actually only feeling worse
2) having a feeling that there is something wrong with your home – it doesn’t feel right at home and wish to stay away
 3) Someone in your home has a serious illness such as cancer, M.E., multiple sclerosis, etc
 4) your house has a history serious illnesses
         If you think you may be affected do not postpone bringing in an easy solution to the problem and get shungite items to your house
Interesting fact you need to know!
Do you know that most of shungite healing properties are due to the presence of fullerenes - carbon atoms bound in the form of a ball - in the stone? ⚫️ Fullerenes were named after the famous architect, Buckminster Fuller because they follow the same architectural pattern as the geodesic domes he created. Fullerenes are primarily noted for antioxidant properties which suppress the processes of peroxidation and free-radical oxidation, hence the shungite antioxidant properties. ✨  
Shungite is the only natural source of fullerene on Earth. The higher content of the carbon in shungite is, the more fullerenes the stone comprises. That is why elite shungite is so much popular for detoxification! Remember the difference between regular and elite shungite stones
Shungite is one of 4 known crystalline modifications of carbon being also most powerful and most long acting antioxidant in a human body fighting free radicals which often cause damage of healthy cells.        ",3.99,4.891,"Craft type: Gardening, Mosaic making, Terrariums

16353,"25 pieces of silk fabric scraps, silk offcuts, Silk Remnants, Sari Silk","
            Sari silks are great for fabric art, egg dyeing, nuno felting, patchwork or other textile projects.
These bags are a dream for textile artists. Great for art projects, these bags are filled with goodies for creative people.
You will receive a mixed parcel with silk fabric ""off cuts"". 
There are about 25 pieces of 7-8 inches squares in each parcel, so you've got plenty to play and experiment with. Most of them are square pieces, but some can have irregular shapes.
The pictures are stock photo's, and do not represent the exact items that you receive,every set is a different ""surprise bag"" of mixed silk. 
The silk is recycled vintage silk, cut from sari's, and can therefore have small holes, spots or other signs of wear.
Some silk is printed and some silk is hand dyed.
The colors may run when washed, so take care in mixing different colors in one project.
If you are after larger pieces of silk, check these ones out:

Stainless Steel Jewelry
***************************** 
- Stainless steel is hypo-allergenic: consider this material if you have allergies or sensitive skin. 
- It is strong, durable and scratch resistant: it is an excellent choice for jewelry that will undergo a lot of use (bracelets and rings). 
- It has a high resistance to rust and corrosion: consider this option if you live in a high-humidity area. 
- It requires little or no maintenance and will not tarnish like silver

            Vintage 1980s Yves Saint Lauren satin pumps with a beautiful gold trim bow, and huge rhinestone design on the vamps shoes and gold color insoles.
Yves Saint Laurent made and still makes high-end shoes, and these shoes are no exception.
Inside the shoe is stamped Yves Saint Laurent Paris, made in Italy the bottom of the shoes are stamped 8 ½.
Please see actual measurements below to ensure correct fit.
Inside sole heel to Toe: 9 ½ inches
Inside balls of feet: 3 inches 
Heel: 3 ½ inches
In our opinion these shoes would best fit a US size 7 ½, 8 and 8 ½.
The shoes are in great condition with a few marks as seen in the photos, we have not tried to remove these, overall this minor issue does not detract from wearing this stylish pair of designer shoes. SOLD AS IS, ALL SALES ARE FINAL.

            These lace up baby boots are perfect for the newest member of the construction crew, the tiniest of hikers, or the newest army recruit.  
The laces allow you to cinch up the boot to avoid the dreaded disappearing baby bootie phenomenon. 
In the listing, you can select Dark Brown with light brown sole, Light Brown with dark brown sole, Black with gray sole, or a custom combination.  Colors can be fully customized at no extra charge.  Just send me a message with your desired color combination of two colors (sole and main boot).
Boots are machine washable; I would advise removing the laces prior to washing and then relacing when dry.
The Sole length from heel to toe is as follows for the available sizes.
0-3 months - 4 inches or 10 centimeters
3-6 months - 4.5 inches or 11.5 centimeters
6-12 months - 5 inches or 12.75 centimeters
