26,"Vintage A. C. Gilbert Erector Set, No. 1 Dandy Beginner's Set","
            A REASONABLE OFFER WILL BE CONSIDERED.
Instruction manual is marked 1929.  Please see photos for what is included.  If you need me to count pieces or need further photos of the manual, I will try to help.  I know nothing about these sets, so this is being sold ""as is.""  
I do know that some of the paint has flaked and is flaking away.  I've put the pieces in plastic bags, and there are little flakes of paint in the bags.  Lots and lots of nuts and bolts.
Thank you for looking.        ",64.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1920s

105,"Antique OOAK folk art child's scooter, original paint, handmade, circa early 1900s","
            What a wonderful example of a one-of-a-kind toy handmade for a special young man in the early 1900's. I know that because it was purchased from the estate of the original owner & comes with a photograph of him out for a ride in his Sunday finest. The charming little three wheeled scooter is hand made from pine & still retains much of the original green paint.
The condition is remarkably good given that it is 90 years old. The collar on the front steering column is cracked and been repaired over the years, as evidenced by the presence of square nails & signs of old glue. We have chosen to leave the old repair, as is, as a reminder that this was a well loved toy. 
Built for a toddler, the scooter measures 17"" long x 16.5"" high at the handle. The rear wheelbase is 9"" wide. The frame with the picture of the original owner is 13"" x 10.5"", 
This is a fun example of early American folk art that is looking for a new home.
Shipping to the US is 30.

130,Vintage Horse and Wagon Coin Operated Kiddie Ride,"
            Please be sure to read shipping information at the end of this description.
This is an early coin operated kiddie ride. It is a horse with a wagon behind it. I sort of think originally it was a fire hose wagon. It was most likely made by Bally and has a wooden base.
It utilizes an early timer set-up in the original coin box. It works well and is working off the coin mechanism. It takes one quarter for a ride. There is a set of new locking swivel casters mounted underneath the base for easy movement.
The base has some wear to the wood and has been repainted. There are some chips, rubs and wear to the body throughout. It measures approximately 67"" long, 28 1/2"" wide and 44 1/2"" tall.
I'd be happy to send additional pictures (Etsy only allows 5) -- just contact me and give me an e-mail address.
Due to size this item cannot be shipped through normal channels. Delivery is possible, as we are legal for-hire haulers. Please contact us for rates. We'd also be happy to work with the shipper of your choice.        ",850.00,4.6667,"Vintage item

I create those drawings from a need to recenter. Drawing has this power to put the soul at ease and I love to share some of the outcomes with you. 
As the idealistic artist I am, I feel an urge to share the silence that we all need to put ourselves at rest in this extremely loud world we live in. Writing can help with that and so the drawingnotebook receipe was born. It's also an ode to all the writers out there: you are so valuable and life-changing!
I remember reading Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist and Henry and June (Anaïs Nin) for the first time and it totally changed my perspective on how we live our lives. Reading both books and a bunch of blogs allows me to connect with people in other worlds and other times to explore so many experiences together.

581,Personalized Fireman Firetruck Knitted Baby Button Up Sweater Cardigan 6 months and 12 months,"
            ***I ALSO KNIT SPORTS TEAMS & UNIVERSITY BABY SWEATERS***
If you do not see your team or school in my shop, please contact me and I will place it into my Etsy shop for you to purchase.  Examples can be seen in my reviews.
What is great about ordering this Fireman Sweater, is after your little one has outgrown the sweater, you can place the sweater on a teddy bear and place it in your child's room as a decoration.
PERSONALIZATION of the sweater with either a initial on the front or a name on the back is done at no extra cost.  Please let me know when ordering if you wish to have this added to the sweater.  Please visit my etsy shop to get an idea of how this looks on my other sweaters.
If this sweater is for a girl, I am able to add a knitted bow to the side of the hat, with a bit of bling on it, to the side of the hat to give it more of a girly feel.
Greeting Cards are created on 5x7 card stock paper and come with an envelope.   I am able to place your sentiment on the inside of the card.  The card that matches the sweaters theme. (Card is an example of what it would look like...I am currently working on a fireman card)  Photo of card is shown in photos above.
Please read the options I offer carefully when ordering.

827,Vintage 1920s/1930s Miriam Haskell Style Sapphire Glass Bead Brass Bells Necklace,"
            This vintage 1920s/1930s necklace features 37 bells each with two round sapphire glass beads dangling from an oval patterned chain in a brass setting.  The original clasp was missing and I added a vintage barrel clasp that works well.  It most likely had a spring ring clasp without the ""thumb-thing.""  The necklace is not marked; however, it is similar to early Miriam Haskell jewelry in material and design.  It measures approximately 14 1/2"" in length by 3/4"" in width, the bells are 12mm x 15mm, and the beads are 4mm and 7mm.
There is tarnish of the brass.  This piece is a wonderful treasure to add to any collection.

967,Antique Long Paste Georgian Earrings,"
            These spectacular long silver / gold earrings are steeped in history.
These look spectacular when worn, the Old Cut Paste stones glisten and sparkle continuously.
When you look at these lovely Georgian earrings, they take you on a journey
over 200 years old, probably from an old lavaliere originally and they have been broken
up to make earrings, the 18ct yellow gold wires have been added over the years.
Paste is a heavy, very transparent flint glass that stimulates the fire and brilliance of gemstones
because it has relatively high indices of refraction and strong dispersion
The Romans in particular were very skilful in the production of coloured - glass pastes
Perfect for a wedding
Set with a closed backed silver gallery and 18ct gold wires
Excellent condition all round.
They weigh 16.8 grams
We can provide a written Valuation on completion of sale.

CONDITION: Very good for their age. Some enamel missing, and they are tarnished.  As stated above one earring has four of the dangles and one has only two.  This isn't noticeable when wearing as the dangles, well, dangle around!  I don't have the backs for these.

1001,18th Century Portuguese Iberian Lazo Earrings with Foiled Amethyst,"
            Dramatic and romantic Iberian earrings, circa 1790-1810.  Each earring is separated into four sections, each designed to move separately, so that the deep purple amethysts and all the diamonds will  twinkle and glisten as they catch the light.  These earrings were so exquisitely made.  
A little background:  ""Iberian"" is the term used for 18th Century (Georgian era)  jewelry from Spain or Portugal.  When Spain and Portugal had colonized South America, incredible gems from Brazil and emeralds from the famous Muzo mines in Columbia found their way into earrings, rings, etc.  which were designed with such expert craftsmanship that they often remain in excellent, wearable condition even today, despite their age.  ""Lazo"" refers to the bow motif from the Spanish for ""bow"".  
These are chock full of diamonds, a mixture of rose cuts and old mine cuts, along with foiled amethysts in gold, closed back settings.  The diamonds are set in silver.  They are quite substantial and heavy, but not uncomfortably so.  
The earrings have posts, which were added in modern times.  They are a little over 2 inches in length.  The larger old mine cuts may be replacements, but if so, they were replaced in antiquity.  There are early Portuguese marks to the back.        ","3,200.00",5.0,"Vintage item from the 1700s

1022,Glamorous Signed Miriam Haskell Earrings Chandelier Earrings Amethyst Stones Baroque Pearls Vintage Jewelry,"
            This is by far one of the most dazzling pair of Miriam Haskell Earrings we have ever acquired!  The intoxicating combination of swaying strands of amethyst beads, rimmed with rhinestones rondelles and lustrous faux baroque pearls, all suspended from a dazzling gilt filigree adorned with clear crystal sparkling rose montees, are absolutely mesmerizing! Adding to the glamorous aura are the single amethyst bead and single baroque pearl coupling in the center of the chandelier earrings, which swing freely, giving these pieces a stunningly dramatic look! This piece is the clip on style with screwbacks for adjustment. These earrings measure approximately 3 inches in length and are hallmarked twice, as seen in the photos, with the Miriam Haskell signature. This is undoubtedly quintessential Miriam Haskell!

1212,Antique Ring solid 18K Gold 23ct natural Blue Sapphire Size 4.75 US/ 9.6,"
            Luxurious Antique Ring in Renaissance style with huge cabochon of  natural Light - Blue Sapphire measuring  16,69 mm x 12.2 mm x  10.7 mm deep /ca 23ct .
Beautifully cut and polished stone,untreated,with numerous inclusions,one of a kind. Fine shank is made of solid 18K Gold .
No hallmarks,likely European, ca. XVIII - XIX centuries.
I got this ring with the stone sitting tightly in its bezel and after examination I became curious about true size,the nature of its color and if it was foiled under or not.
Actually it was backed with some darkened tissue,likely organic,now almost disintegrated to ashes.
Removing the stone without any harm turned out to be easy.
Sapphire has drop shaped body,symmetrically cut, neatly and smoothly polished to high gloss on both sides.
The rays and layers of Blue of different intensity magically dissolved and frozen in its hard body.
Numerous inclusions add more charm to this fine gem.Miniature Universe for Your finger only !  :)
Measurements :  29 mm x 28 mm at axes ; bezel is 18.5 mm x 14.5 mm ;
Size : Ø 4.75 US / 15.53  mm. Sizing is possible for additional payment .
Weight:  9.6  grams
Condition: Used  Fine condition,looks Great for age :) 
The Stone was removed for examination,measuring and demonstration purposes and will be secured in its bezel before you will get it.

1217,Antique Gold Ring ~ Amethyst Stone: Size 8.5,"
            The faceted  stone in this ring is a beautiful mid purple with flashes of lilac. It is a natural stone, inclusions are visible when held to the light. Foliate design covers the shoulders of the ring. 
The metal tests as a thick 14k gold shell over what seems to be a lower karat (9k?) gold/silver alloy (white gold). The back of the ring has the remains of a mark but it has worn so cannot be deciphered. 
Size is 8.5. Circa 1900. Weight is 2.5 grams. The stone measures about 1/4 of an inch across. 
Minor surface wear on the stone. The yellow gold shell has worn through to the white gold underneath, on the back of the ring and on some of the raised areas of the foliate design, visible only on close inspection. The back of the band is slightly out of round. Please see photos.        ",225.00,5.0,"Vintage item from 1900 - 1909

            A beautiful Art Deco aquamarine ring. A single octagonal aquamarine in a simple millegrain-edge platinum set 18ct gold ring. The setting has some classic chenier tube detail and is particularly Art Deco in style. A fabulous statement ring!
Gemstones: - The main stone is an octagonal step-cut aquamarine of a sea-green/blue colour. It measures approximately 12.3mm x 10.6mm.
Hallmarks: - There is an '18CT' stamp inside the ring. There is also a maker's mark - 'F.T.' The white metal on top of the setting is platinum, which is typical for the period. We would date this ring to circa 1920.
Finger Size: -
The finger size is a UK size O 1/2, or a US size 7 1/4, but we can size it to whatever size you need. Just let us know what size you require when you place the order and allow an additional 10 days for delivery.

Condition: -
This is an antique ring, and as such may have wear typical for a ring of its age. Apart from some minor wear to the top facet edges of the aquamarine and superficial wear to the setting edges, the ring is in good condition.

1253,"Antique Ring - 22k Gold French Napoleon III Empire Natural Pearl Victorian Ring, Antique Jewelry Victorian Jewelry Statement size 7","
            Antique Pearl Ring | Victorian Ring | French Empire Ring
A rare and incredible 19th century French antique ring, of solid 22K gold casted in the form of double openwork laurel wreaths encircling deftly suspended natural pearls, and connecting to a ring shank with shoulders chased in the 'branche de laurier' pattern. Weighing an unusual 5.9 grams, this is a substantial and gorgeous piece-- the incredible richness of the 22k gold pairs well with the luminous translucency of the sea-harvested natural pearls (i.e. not farm cultivated from an artificial nucleus).
Though crafted between 1860-80 during the ""Second French Empire"" period, this ring is stylistically rooted in the 1810s neoclassicism of Napoleon Bonaparte's First French Empire. This ""Empire Style"", as it is commonly called today, provided a kind of visual & aesthetic vocabulary for Napoleon's consolidation of power. Archeological motifs from ancient Rome, such as the gold laurel wreaths seen on this ring, were adapted to evoke the elegance and stoic virtues of Republican Rome, while finesse of craftsmanship and adoption of bold, ostentatious colors (such as gold, red, and black) lent Empire style decorative arts a sense of grandeur and authority. Indeed, this ring is all at once reserved, elegant, and glamorously chic. Art and designs from the First French Empire proved to be so enduring that European monarchies adapted its look throughout the 19th century, even after the fall of Napoleon I. The Empire style experienced a particularly strong revival in France during the monarchical restorations of Louis Philippe I and Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (later Emperor Napoléon III).

1375,French Loto Game/Vintage French Loto/Loto Game Cards/Vintage Bingo Box Cards Numbers/Lottery Cards and Numbers/Loteria Vintage Box Game,"
            An old French Loto game in a beautifully labelled wooden box with a wonderful french Image and Graphics on the lid. 
Loto (or Lotto) is a popular family board game in France and is basically Bingo. This set is complete with cards and 66 wooden ""pions"" or counters ( there would have been 90 originally) It is still in its original wooden box. I estimate this set dates to the 1930s.
The previous owner has written their name in beautiful handwriting on the inside lid of the box. People don't write like that anymore!
Would be a great nostalgic display decoration.
It is in well worn vintage condition, this game has clearly been used and enjoyed for many years. The box is a little worn and  the catch is broken although the lid closes perfectly.  The cards are all in good condition but some of them are a little faded.
The box simply looks wonderful on a book table. Great for storing other things in also. I have included some other French vintage language cards which came in the box. Great for learning French Words with pictures!
Dimensions: 22cm long 15.5 cm depth. 10.5 cm high.

1513,"Duck call, Vintage  ""Scotch"" game call, duck feeding call, shaker call","
            In 1955 a man name Max Harley applied for a patent for a new duck call that you squeeze or shake, such a basic idea and simple to use This call is a model 1401 and is made up of two pieces, a traditional looking 4 1/4"" wooden duck call and a an 11"" black rubber tube that attatches to the wooden call. When shaken it sounds very much like a duck feeding call.  
This call is in very good condition, and works very well. It comes in the original box which is in one piece but the condition is lower than the call itself. Please see all pictures for details and convo me with any questions.        ",55.00,4.8952,"Vintage item from the 1960s

ABOUT USED FURNITURE: Please keep in mind that this piece is an antique or later period piece and is sold in 'as-is' condition. Buyers of antiques know that the character of old furniture is often exhibited in the unique way it shows its age. We try to fully describe each piece in an attempt to let you know exactly what you will be receiving. To further clarify each item, we include detailed and close-up photos that frequently exaggerate wear and tear in a way that is not representative of how the item will appear under typical casual observation in your home or office. Close-up photos often cause the finish color to appear lighter or surface imperfections to appear larger or more severe than when the item is viewed directly. The primary image is most often the best representation of color and overall appearance. We carefully select each item for quality and value with our customer in mind.

1690,BEAUTIFUL VANITY Order Your Own Antique Painted Vanity The Shabby Chic Furniture Custom Painted Furniture Vanity Dressing Table,"
            Custom Order your own ANTIQUE VANITY and mirror to be sourced, refinished and painted in any color. We only offer shabby chic furniture that will exude romance and old-world charm! 
YES! WE SHIP FURNITURE NATIONWIDE. 14 YEARS.
How it works: Add this order to your cart and let us know which style you love from the examples shown above. We'll locate your perfect antique vanity and send pre-work photos for your review. Once you approve the vanity, we will restore, enhance and refinish it in our fabulous shabby chic style. The custom order process takes roughly 10 weeks. We keep you up-to-date on the vanity's progress every step of the way.  500 down to get started, another 500 when the piece you love is found, balance due when vanity is finished, approved and ready to ship. At Check Out please mark payment as OTHER. This allows you to complete without paying in full. An invoice for the down will follow later. PayPal or credit card accepted.
Vanities are not in stock. We do not build them. They are from the 1920's era and are very well constructed from strong, old growth wood and with century-long durability unlike today's new furnishings. We restore to last another 100 years.
Our refinishing is always hand painted by brush, using only USA made water-based, no VOC, lead-free paints. We take our time and properly apply multiple coats of paint with a smooth silky feel, {chic} oh yes! We can add a touch, or a lot, of {shabby} with our unique weathered age distressed finesse. Named stock colors are our own custom blends (see color choices in the dropdown). We will also paint in your custom 1 color for an additional 50. Please inquire if you want metallic or multiple tone paint.
Mirrors typically will have age spots or ghosting but clear enough to apply makeup. The wood inside the drawers will have signs of use but get rejuvenated for a rich look. All drawers will open and close properly. Vanities have antique metal pulls and knobs with old patinas. The old wheels shown are not included, however, new hard wood replica wheels are available to buy. 
Most Economical Shipping: To your nearest Greyhound PackageXpress office for pick up. Insurance and extreme quality packing are included. Picking up from GPX is easy. Many GPX stations offer station-to-home delivery for a little more money if needed. Mirror will ship by FedEx. For additional  FedEx Ground shipping the base may be possible. Please contact us for rates to Hawaii, Alaska and Canada. No shipping charge if picking up at our shop in Oklahoma City.
WE ARE RED BARN ESTATES: We specialize in furniture for Paris Apartment, Shabby Chic Cottage, Beach House and Vacation homes. Our antique and vintage furniture is carefully restored. Most pieces have carved wood backsplashes we design. The old wood will have dents, nicks and dings here and there that add to the weathered, worn and distressed charm of the piece.

1757,Black Forest Cuckoo Clock Vintage Deer Hunter Hunting Rifles Ammunition Bag Horn Animals Rabbit Pheasant Musical Carousel Dancers Thorens,"
            An amazing vintage hand carved Black Forest cuckoo clock.  Clock has The deer head for the finial with the carved rifles to complete the crown.  Animated musical carousel dancers. Hand carved Rabbit and Pheasant along the sides.  The carved horn encircles the face of the clock.  Below you will see the ammunition bag.
 Cuckoo comes out on the hour, as well as the half hour.  The dancers come out on the hour, as well as the half hour. 
Particulars: This is a one day, three weight clock, which means it should run for 30 hours, but most people call them one day movements, as to remember to pull the chains up each day, in order to keep it running.  Back is stamped Made in Germany.  The side has a sticker reading Thorens Movement Frohliche Wanderer Holzhackerbub'n Made in Switzerland.  Thorens is the manufacturer of the musical movement for the dancers.  Inside is marked Hones Titiser-Neustadt West Germany on the clock works.
Measurements: Clock measures 23"" from the top of the antlers to the bottom of the pendulum.
Also, all my clocks have been cleaned and  are in running order. If you are not familiar with setting up a clock you may want to find someone local who deals or works with antique clocks, as they have to be level and properly set up in order to run correctly.
Will be professionally wrapped, tracked, insured and signature confirmation through UPS.

1831,Pair of Gothic shaped Brass Mirrors/ Brass Gothic Mirrors/ Patina glass gothic mirrors/ Brass church mirrors/ Arched vintage mirrors.,"
            Stunning Pair of unusual Gothic shaped Mirrors. 
Brass frame and small detailing on the sides and 2 little round feet, they have a perfect amount of patina on the glass. 
They are great light reflector mirrors to add interest and light into a corner of a room or displayed on either side of a mantelpiece.
They have red leather backing and one of the mirrors has a wire hanger, although it is safer to attach new hangers to the back if you wanted to hand them on a wall.
Until then, displayed on a bookcase or either side of a mantelpiece will show them off nicely.
What makes these little beauties so interesting is the Gothic arch shape, the detailing on the sides and the perfect amount of patina on the glass. 
They are simply wonderful!
You get 2 Mirrors with this one purchase ( Pair)

1870,"Vintage French School Map Rossignol - Paris school geography map, Vintage map Paris, France, 50s, Wall decoration Old School Map - Map Paris","
            
Vintage Rossignol school map representing Paris and its region. The map is printed on both sides.
These Rossignol maps were in every french school in the 50s and 60s. All french pupils studied geography with them! Today, they are subjects of nostalgia and so many memories!
We find them also very poetic. Looking at them makes one want to travel, or moved to recognize familiar places!
The historical perspective is also fascinating : so many geopolitical changes occurred in the world between the 50s and today. The challenge is to find all of them and use them to date these maps!
This vintage school map is 90 cm long and 75 cm wide (35.4 x 29.5 inches).
This map presents traces of use : some humidity brown marks and two small tears on two edges (see pictures).

1879,Encyclopedia Britannica Black 12 Inch Globe by Replogle,"
            Striking black 12 inch Replogle globe that was a premium given to customers who purchased an entire set of encyclopedias.  The globe is mounted on a chrome base.  Dual axis. There a few minor blemishes: a couple of drips of paint (see picture), a small pin hole and a few scrapes but overall it is in very good vintage condition. I do not know the exact date of the globe.  It does show USSR, Korea and Romania spelled Rumania. Whether the globe dates from the 60s, 70s or 80s it would make a fantastic statement piece for any modern, midcentury or industrial home.

1986,Large vintage wooden finial,"
            Finials are used extensively as a decorative feature, architectural detail, for furniture, clocks, cabinets, mirrors, balustrades, fence posts, bed posts, curtains, flag poles, any restoration or repairing vintage of antique or even new objects in general
Stunning architectural piece!
Timeless craftsmanship, gorgeous piece of architectural salvage.
Handturned, carved from a single piece of wood. 
Heavy due to it being of solid wood.
Can stand on its own as decorative element.
Shows vintage use as you can observe in the pictures!
My husband and his dad used loads of them as replacement parts on old clock cases or as ornaments for new cases. His dad was always on the look out for some vintage ones, to fulfill his clock repair or as a woodworker for any decoration needs!
Whether it’s the industry or used for individual design finishing, refurbishing your woodworking project, is done with finials.

            Boy, do I wish I'd seen the original piece this vintage yellow metal divided drawer came from! Luckily, I've had 3 of these drawers for a few years to enjoy myself. This metal cubby organizer would be great for craft storage, or a unique display for collections. 
Originally an industrial storage drawer, this metal cubby organizer can be used flat, or standing up. It measures 15-1/4"" wide x 13"" (14 when you include the lip) x 3-5/8"" high. This particular drawer has a whopping 12 sections; each section measures 3-7/8"" x 4-1/8"" x 3-5/8"".
I also have a 4-section one:

And a 6-section one:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/464537335/vintage-yellow-metal-divided-drawer
This drawer is HEAVY—nearly 10 pounds—and sturdy. And, hello! YELLOW! It does show wear (scratches and discoloration). I ran each through the dishwasher and scrubbed, so the discoloration is not dirt.
I will always combine shipping when possible, and refund any shipping overcharges over 1. Because of its weight, the cheapest way to ship this is UPS. But, I've added USPS as an upgrade option for an additional 6.        ",42.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1940s

2205,Vintage Weiss-like Thermo Plastic Rhinestone Clamper Bracelet (E17),"
            Here we have a 1950's black, unsigned Weiss-type clamper bangle that has large white and very clean rhinestones.  It is so dazzling you may need sunglasses to view it.  It measures 2"" from side to side and therefore you need to have a very small wrist to wear it.  It's in excellent condition but it doesn't meet exactly at the two sides.  There is a small overlap.  When you have it on, you cannot see this, but it is there and needed to be shown (see photos).  The hinge is nice and snappy and perfectly tight.

2210,Michaela Frey Floral  Enamel Bangle,"
            Michaela Frey Floral  Enamel Bangle
This is a pretty Michaela Frey bangle with plum, lavender and rose enamel.  The bracelet measures 2 5/8 in diameter and 3/8 of an inch wide.   It would fit a medium hand I think.    My hand measures about 8 inches around the middle of my palm and it is very snug to get it on and off.
The hallmark on the inside is 'Michaela Frey Team'.  The enamel is in good  condition with some flea bites to the edges normal for vintage enamel.  Please enlarge all of the pictures and ask me any questions that you may have.        ",55.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1970s

2322,Vintage Dominique Aurientis Paris Pate de Verre Stones Foliage Cuff,"
            Type: Cuff; slip-on.
Color: Yellow, red, brown, and gold.
Width of cuff: 6.5cm/ 2.625 inches.
Width of opening: 6cm/ 2.375 inches.
Weight: Very heavy.
Origin: France.
Must know: There is glue residue at the edges of the largest round amber stone; otherwise in excellent condition.
This is one of the most amazing cuffs we have ever come across during our jewelry-hunting season! It features three (3) large ornate gold leaves. There are many round pate de verre stones in brown, yellow, and red in different sizes scattered throughout the fronds, along with round yellow and brown rhinestones. This cuff is very special because the ends are different; one is tapered while the other flares out in a curve, so the ends stick out a little when it is worn. A very dimensional piece that is very runway-worthy! Signed ""Dominique Aurientis PARIS"" on the underside.

            Black cameo brooch is quite unique. This glass cameo brooch has a gold tone bezel setting. It has a rear setting with a spin clasp. Quite the striking piece of cameo jewelry.
The cameo is very well done the artist took the time to carve the first woman hair piece so that it is made of the brighter Black of the shell. 
Good vintage condition. It will become a great addition to your collection and a wonderful gift to your friend or girl.

2393,Antique Chinese Kingfisher Feather Butterfly Coin Silver Gilt Brooch Pin,"
            This antique 1890-1910 Chinese figural butterfly brooch features Kingfisher bird feathers in a  vermeil coin silver setting.  There are small round red metallic-like eyes, and I am not sure whether or not they are original to this piece.  It has a C-type clasp that works well.  The brooch is not marked and measures approximately 1 3/4"" in length by 1 1/4"" in width.

            Use these nostalgic vintage postage stamps to mail your cards or those invitations for a party.
OR
Use these unused unmarked stamps for your very special aceo, collage, jewelry or other creative creation.
S T O R Y
The first Love stamp, issued in 1973, proved so popular that a second stamp was issued in 1982 and then again in 1984 and 1985. Although the Love stamp was usually issued in time for use on Valentine's Day mail, it was intended to enhance cards and letters on many other special occasions throughout the year such as weddings, birthdays, and anniversaries. 
THIS LOT: all fine MINT UNused United States postage valid for current use as postage.
5 LOVE Pink Rose 1988 issue 25 cent stamps
5 Pink Flowers 1981 issue 18 cent stamps (4 unique designs)
5 Public reads 1943 issue 4cent stamps 
5 Lafayette 1957 issue 3cent stampms
Enough to post 5 - 1oz letters at .50 each. 
NOTE: one or more of the stamps used in your custom design are part of a setenant set of stamps. These stamps were issued and are sold, collected and traded as sets. You will receive an equal number of each stamp in the set.
Enjoy!
Postage Tip:  If you need more than the standard 49cents for your mailing you can use vintage postage alongside of current USPS stamps.  So you could use a current USPS stamp (you can see what they have to offer at the USPS website) and then add ??cents worth of vintage postage to complete the arrangement.  This can be a cost and space effective way to add that vintage touch.  Something old and something new!        ",8.25,5.0,"Vintage Supply

            These exceptionally lovely vintage metal components links feature a unique, engraved floral design on the square links.  These are gorgeous metal links have been separated from a European nurses belt.  These links are a bit smaller than those usually found in these vintage belts, and the design is more intricate and finely executed.  These are really lovely, unique links.  The metal is sturdy and is well polished.  There are no markings as to the type of metal, but I believe them to be EPNS, due to the age and origin of the belt links.  These links are beautiful when incorporated into jewelry pieces.  I use them for bracelets and for necklaces.  The vintage elegance elevates any jewelry piece I use them in.  
These beauties are from the UK.  I believe they were made pre 1930's.

13 years furniture shipping nationwide and Canada.

Antique converted vanities are trending! They are showpieces for 1800 and early 1900 Victorian farmhouse and brown stone renovations ~ powder rooms, guest baths and master baths. Put them in all your bathrooms! They look fab with marble stone or granite, old fashioned faucets and vessel or inset sinks! We provide the cabinet ready for your plumbing. 500 down to get started, another 500 when we find the piece you love, balance due when vanity is finished, approved and ready to ship.
Here's what one Etsy customer said about her custom dresser to vanity conversion: ""Loved my custom vanity. Not only was it exactly what I envisioned, working with these artists was a pleasure.

Sizes vary so let us know size range needed. We may de-construct the piece to make size modifications. 
The pieces we sell are from about the 1920's era. We select pieces with excellent craftsmanship, constructed from strong, old growth wood and life-long durability. 
Interior modifications, depending on the piece's drawer/cabinet placement, include:
1) creating a clear area for plumbing with faux drawer fronts
2) cabinet storage space with doors made from the original drawer fronts
4) removing back and making it installation ready
3) reinforcing frame to hold stone, marble or granite tops. The original wood top will be taken out. Sink vessel, faucets, plumbing and top  are NOT included. Your contractor can better provide those for perfect fits with exact size templates that come with your new hardware.
How our custom order works.... Start now by placing your order. Advise your style preference and size needs. We'll then go to work to find the piece and send photos in its original condition for your approval. Once you approve the piece, we restore, convert, enhance and refinish it in our old fashioned shabby chic style. 
Click on the green button ADD TO CART. At checkout mark payment form as OTHER. This allows order completion without paying in full. A PayPal invoice for the 500 down payment will be sent afterwards or we can take your cc by phone. A 500 down payment is required. If we don't find a piece you love in a reasonable time the down payment will be refunded. 
The process is about 8 to 10 weeks. Finding time is allocated within this timeframe. Status updates and photos are sent throughout the refinishing process. It is a fun process creating your vanity working with Camille! Share your ideas and we'll do our best to fill your dream.
All antique furniture will have characteristic dents and dings here & there. We ensure there are no major faults. We use antique metal pulls and knobs, some with old patinas.
Painting is done by hand and by brush. It takes time and we properly apply multiple coats of paint. No spray paint.  Stock colors are our own blends (see color choices in the dropdown). We will also use your custom 1 color for an additional 50, selected from your local hardware store. Metallic colors and 2-tones are extra, please ask.
PACKING AND SHIPPING: We ship nationwide to your nearest Greyhound PackageXpress station for pick up as the most economical way. Insurance and extreme quality packing always included. Picking up from GPX is fast and easy. Many GPX stations offer station-to-home delivery for a little more money. For additional money FedEx Ground shipping may be available.

            This is an adorable golden yellow cotton coverlet or bedspread featuring two maidens frolicking with a basket in a field of pretty white flowers. The maiden scene is repeated throughout the piece.  The coverlet is a cheery color of yellow like a soft daffodil. Any discoloration in the photos is photos only - the coverlet has even fabric weave and coloring, no fading. In photo #2 you will see both sides of the coverlet, one is brighter than the other. I put the lemon in a photo for reference and have it displayed on a bed (however my decor is not quite the right style)... would look lovely with crisp cotton or lace pillows. The coverlet is in excellent condition with no fading or tears but there is a 1/2"" flaw about 3/4 of the way down left of center (photo # 5).  Looks big in the photo but on a bed is barely noticeable.

3382,vintage 80s Izod Lacoste Little Boys Striped Blue Yellow & White Preppy Polo Shirt with Green Crocodile Size 5 6,"
            Ah, to be young again, when life's biggest decisions were whether or not to pop one's collar.
*sigh*
Circa 1980s Izod Lacoste polo shirt (maker label was cut out) for your little guy (or gal if you like) in navy blue, yellow and white with blue croc
50/50 dacron polyester, combed cotton, marked a size 8, but honestly I don't see how this will fit a little boy's 8 when it doesn't fit my son, who wears a 6/7- please look at measurements
Short sleeves, fold down collar, iconic blue croc, two button closure at neck
Measurements: 24"" chest, 16"" long, 12"" shoulder seam to seam (taken flat and not doubled)
Condition: gently worn and loved, lots of life left- this one comes directly from my own kidlets' vintage stash
Size estimation: I'm guessing this will fit somewhere around a little boys 5-7

3656,Mens Vintage Blazer 36R 100% Wool Black White Pinstripe Sports Coat Suit Jacket Free US Shipping,"
            This is a great vintage men's blazer from the 1980s that was made in the USA.  The material is 100% pure wool, and it is black with white pinstripes.  The blazer is fully lined, and it has a single vent in the back.  The blazer has three inside pockets, two lower outside pockets and a single breast pocket.  It closes with two buttons, and there are matching buttons on the ends of the sleeves.
 SIZING
The blazer does not have a size tag, but it measures like a size 36R.  The actual measurements are as follows:
Chest: 19.5 inches across, underarm to underarm (39 inches around)
Shoulders: 16.5 inches across, seam to seam
Sleeves: 24.75 inches from the shoulder seam to the end of the sleeve
Length: 29.5 inches down the center of the back, starting from the base of the collar
Note: These are the actual measurements of the garment, so please leave yourself room for comfort of movement. All measurements were taken with the item laying flat. The flat measurements were doubled to give an approximate measurement around. 
CONDITION
This blazer is in very good vintage condition.  I did notice a tiny bit of wear to lining along the edge of one inside pocket (see last picture), but this is a minor flaw that is not visible when the blazer is worn.
Please feel free to ask any questions about this item before making your purchase.  I have MANY items in my store, so shop around a bit. I offer free US shipping on all my items! :-)

3716,Rare early 1970s vintage Quorum Ossie Clark/Alice Pollock sculptural midi dress,"
            Stunning, almost sculptural midi dress from the legendary London boutique Quorum. Quorum was started by Alice Pollock and was also the home of Ossie Clark. Designs by both Pollock and Clark were also sold with just the Quorum label inside, and I believe that this may well be a rare example of Ossie's more tailored work for Quorum. I absolutely adore the plunge front, fastened with a zip up to the waist but then only with a hook and eye at the bust. And the sides are completely open, giving a sexy flash of ribcage. It's like a sexy Safari outfit!
Measurements:
Bust fairly free due to style. I would guess around 36""-38"" - Waist 28"" - Hips 38"" - Length 47""
Fabric:
Feels like a sort of gabardine. Polycotton mix.
Condition:
One small mark on the front, possibly from a brooch being fastened there. A smudgy mark on one end of the tie belt. Sold as vintage.        ",258.69,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1970s

3720,Antique Lace Edwardian Wedding Dress 1910 Brussels Lace Gown Bohemian Bridal Gown Unique Belle Epoque Ethereal Wedding Dress,"
            Seeing is believing and this ultra feminine slip of a dress (so much lace!) really does need to be seen and held to appreciate just how delicately beautiful and soft it is. 
 The majority of the dress has been expertly hand sewn from intricate Brussels Pointe de Gaze lace in a pale cream with a darker cream flounce to the bottom of the dotted Swiss lace front panel. 
More cotton lace adorns the back and across the shoulders. The sleeves are particularly pretty having a scallop lace trim. 
I think this dress would look amazing with a vintage floor length gauze embroidered veil (I'll be listing one very soon!)
The dress is shown under a blush pink vintage silk slip and this is not included in the sale. I would recommend you wear a silk crepe slip underneath, custom made to the length and colour you require. 
As Edwardian dresses were often worn over longer underskirts, having your own under slip made would allow you to 'lengthen' the dress should it be too short as it is.
In excellent condition. There is a 0.5 inch fine repair to one of the sleeves and a few tiny breaks in the gauze although you need to look very closely to find them as there is so much lace. 
Apologies for the photos - trying to photograph dresses in the dull light of a cold British Winter isn't great :-( but should you need to see more then please just shout out.

3833,Above Average Vintage Mouton Fur Jacket Med/Large Daytons Sheared Dyed Lamb,"
            This is a beautiful dark chocolate fur jacket sold by Daytons, a department store in Minneapolis that was famous for quality.
The fur is smooth and clean, no odors. The satin lining is intact, no visible tears and very little signs of wear. Two hook closure. 
This  above average fur jacket has great detail, the side pockets and 5"" cuffs have braided cording. The cuffs also have a mother of pearl button on each side, intact and shiny.
I'm not sure when it was made. It has the wide cuffs, but not the big shoulder pads of the 40's. I'm thinking the early 1950's.
I think this is a size Med/Large. The inside arm hole to arm hole measures 21"" across. From nape of neck to bottom is 26"" long. The sleeve  measures 24"" from shoulder to bottom of cuff. (The sleeve can be shortened by adjusting the cuff). 
Excellent gently used condition.
Just a note. This mouton fur is thick and heavy, it weighs about 5 pounds. It is ideal for cold climates.        ",224.00,4.9355,"Vintage item from the 1950s

3851,"Guilloche enamel sterling silver powder compact, double sided white enamel compact with handpainted flowers, Art Deco 1920's powder compacts","
            Up for offer is this stunning vintage Art Deco compact done in double sided white enamel guilloche and sterling silver!  It is considered double sided since there is enamel on the lid and bottom of the compact, which makes this compact extra special.
The lid is done in white enamel over a detailed guilloche or engine turned pattern, and when the compact is turned in the light, the true beauty of the pattern and the translucent white enamel is revealed.  So pretty!  Under the clear coat of the enamel there are various tiny flowers handpainted in pretty shades of purple, pink, red, and yellow, and green leaves too.   
The sterling silver ring on the bottom of the compact that surrounds the lid when it is closed, has a beautiful engraved pattern.  The back of the compact is also done in transluscent like white enamel over a beautiful guilloche (engine turned) design.  
The inside has a mirror set in a metal retainer ring.  The mirror's glass is in very good condition with some tiny marks of age but has a lovely clear reflection, there is no foxing or loss of silver.  There is a very pretty powder sifter in the bottom of the compact, and it works well.  These are all marvelous details that make this circa 1920's compact very collectible!
The compact is in wonderful vintage condition.  I was not able to see any scratches in the enamel, even when it is held to the light.  There are no chips, damage, or repairs.  The enamel is just in trully lovely condition!  The clasp is in good working order, the compact closes nicely with a snap and it remains closed. 
The silver work on the compact is all in beautiful condition too!! 
What a lovely addition this would make to your vintage compacts collection!
It measures approximately 2-1/16 inches in diameter. (52 mm)
First Class International shipping price includes tracking.

3854,Antique Maxfield Parrish Print Circe's Palace Antique Art Print 1908 P F Collier and Sons Parrish Print Nathaniel Hawthorne Cover Blue,"
            This is a wonderful, antique, original, Maxfield Parrish print.  It is titled Circe's Palace.  Originally painted for Collier’s in 1908 and the image was also used for the cover of A Wonder Book and Tanglewood Tales by Nathaniel Hawthorne. In Greek mythology, the witch Circe was the daughter of the sun god Helios and the ocean nymph Perseis. According to legend, Circe lived on the island of Aeaea, where she built a palace and practiced spells that enabled her to turn men into animals. This is a fairly rare Maxfield Parrish image.  The condition is very good with bright colors and only a small crease in the corner which would be covered by a frame.  There is also some edge marks that would also be covered by a frame. The overall condition is very good. It does have P.F. Collier & Sons in the bottom left corner. The size is 9"" x 11"". This is a beautiful Maxfield Parrish print that would look great in any décor!

3908,Vintage Folding Light Green Hobby Land Camera Model 80 Retro Metal,"
            Vintage Polaroid Land Camera Model 80
This is a wonderful piece to add to a vintage camera collection.  It is a light green shade and dates from the 1950's.
 
It is 7-1/2"" long x 4-1/2"" wide and is 2-1/2 deep when closed.  It easily extends to 5-3/4"" when opened, and has a leather strap.  There is a crack near the view finder, I'm sure from being extensively used.  Not known if it is operational.
This is a great item to showcase on the shelf of one who is interested in the field of photography (such as a gift for a teen).

3926,VV Rare Ambrotype Photo WOMAN Civil War Cavalry Soldier,"
            Original circa 1863 ninth-plate (1/9) ruby ambrotype of a FEMALE Civil War Cavalry soldier. Nice, gold-hand coloring throughout, including a ""US"" on the belt buckle.
Yes, I truly believe this is a woman disguised as a man. 
Everything about this soldier seems feminine to me: Take a close look at the hair, the jawline, eyes and eyebrows, and mouth, thighs... all very feminine physical features. One or two, I might dismiss, but there are just too many non-masculine features here to overlook. 
In addition, her coat fit doesn't look quite right - it looks a bit ""stuffed"" to me... possibly to add the appearance of bulk and/or from binding?
Keep in mind women in the CW had to fool people, face to face, into believing that they were men..... you're just not going to find a female CW soldier looking more feminine than this one. If a documented photo of this woman ever comes up in the future, the value of this image would instantly increase many times over.
There were hundreds of female soldiers, on both sides, that disguised themselves as men, including a woman named Mary Owens Jenkins, a PA 9th Cavalry soldier. I'm not saying this is Mary - I could not find a photo of her online. Mary Owens supposedly joined the service to be with a man she loved, William Evans. She used the Alias John Evans. William Evans reportedly died and  Mary/John stays in Service. Abraham Jenkins, whom she did marry, was also in the 9th PA. 
I recommend searching on Google for Women Soldiers of the Civil War By DeAnne Blanton, which should take you to a fascinating website on the topic.
Condition - Very nice. All of the little white dots are just dust particles on my scanner or on the photo glass. The image is super nice, sharp and clear. A small spot by her face, as shown, otherwise absolutely no other issues of note.

3967,Vintage Guilloche Enamel Compact Dance Purse Minaudiere Necessaire w/ Chain FMCO,"
            This is an exquisite compact with everything m'lady would need for a night out on the town!  The guilloche enamel is bright and in perfect condition: white with pink and blue flowers and green leaves.  Inside is a compartment for powder with the original powder and puff.  Next to that is a compartment to hold rouge.  The original sticker is present with the address of Finberg Mfg CO to reorder a new blush for 50¢.  Love it!!  There is a little tab to pull the mirror down which reveals a secret compartment.  So sweet!  
There are a few scratches from wear and age on the back and some wear to the silver finish on one edge which you can see on the last photo. I don't know if that could be polished up bright or not.

The Great Exhibition of 1851 was the catalyst that fueled the Arts and Crafts Movement. The exhibits were described as badly made with excessive ornamentation. The Arts and Crafts Movement reaction to the disappointing exhibits was to encourage high quality 'crafts' of craftsmen and artisans. This movement was noted for simplified natural motifs. In many parts of Europe devotees of this movement had strong negative feelings about the use of machinery in the creation of accessories, furniture and works of art. Craftsmen should work with their hands and be free to express their creativity. These craftsmen would return to using primitive tools to produce high quality simplified pieces which often had the appearance of a pre-industrial age. Today Arts and Crafts pieces are highly collectible. There was no extravagant decoration and they are very beautiful.
This is an Arts & Crafts cigarette case made c. the late 1800s. The case is fully hallmarked 800 silver. This composition of 800 silver lends itself to the creation of dark patina which is particularly pleasing on pieces of this genre. This patina can only improve with age and what a beautiful example this antique silver case is. On the lid and base three Centaurea in bloom with a bud on the lower right hand side. The simplicity and balance of the design so charming which is why this movement has such a following. Push the thumb catch to activate a spring loaded catch. The gilded interior showing the repoussage in reverse. The original gold elastic strap still in place. All clasps and hinges work perfectly. So often Arts & Crafts pieces have the appearance of primitive / medieval items and this is certainly so with this antique silver case. The case is in very good condition.
This antique case measures 9 cm X 7.5 cm and weighs 68. grams.

4071,VTG Showa Era Art Sketch Bag Case Shoujo Manga Illustration Maki Miyako Japan,"
            For sale is this beautiful Showa era sketch bag. From Japan and probably dates to 1960's/1970's. I believe the artwork is by Maki Miyako (signature shown in photo 3, I found the same image identified as Maki Miyako's work on a Japanese website). Case measures approximately 15.5 x 11.75 x 1.25 inches. Back has a clip to attach paper and use the surface to sketch on. Inside is one pocket and a band.
Item is in noticeably used condition with some issues worth mentioning (please read carefully):
The plastic on the front is warped. There is an especially noticeable U-shaped warp where the handle was resting against the front for a long period of time and made an imprint.
 There are some dark marks and ""dirty"" marks all over, front, back and inside. It looks like something blue transferred in some places on the front (see photo 5). Inside there is a yellowish discoloration to the plastic that is not captured well in the photos.
 Metal parts have some rusting.
 The stretchy band inside is very brittle and will not stretch back into place. I think it will break apart if you continue to pull it.
 Normal wear and tear from use and age.
Please contact me if you have any additional questions or would like to see more photos.        ",24.99,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1960s

4091,"Art Deco Powder Compact, Zell Fifth Avenue, Silver with Gold Overlay, Clear Rhinestones, Removable Pressed Pat, Made in USA","
            An elegant memento from a gentler time.
This mid century Zell 5th Avenue powder compact has a lovely silver tone lid highlighted with an art deco style gold tone overlay and three faceted rhinestones. The base is finished in a continuous engine turned wave pattern and is signed USA in the center circle.
The compact opens to reveal a mirrored lid, a powder puff signed Zell Fifth Avenue, a sifter and a full pat of pressed powder.  
The powder pat is removed by inserting a bobby pin or pointed instrument into the groove on the right side of the golden rim and lifting. It is replaced by moving the golden lever under the mirror and inserting the new pat.
The well was also designed to hold loose powder.
CONDITION - Please zoom in on the images to examine.
- The mirror has some age spots near the top center. You can see them in images 3 & 4.
- The base has wear and scratches (Image 5)
- The lid has some black wear spots (Image 1)
Very good vintage condition otherwise.
Measurements:
Outer - 3.25 inches / 8.2 cm in diameter.
Inner powder well - 2.5 inches / 6.4 cm in diameter.
Zell Fifth Avenue
With many of it's former 5th Avenue counterparts [including Rex, Columbia and Dorset], Zell was a big name along 5th Avenue when it came to powder compacts. These companies with “Fifth Avenue” appended to their names were often called “the Fifth Avenues”

4092,Vintage Stratton Compact Mirror Scone Regal Corona Plaid Celluloid,"
            DESCRIPTION
Vintage Stratton compact mirror with black felt pochette.  Red and green plaid fabric under celluloid or plastic.  Gold tone.  3” round shape known as the Scone, Regal, or Corona.  The embossed edge leads me to believe that this is most likely a Scone.  For use with loose powder.  Original powder sifter.  Original package insert stating, “keep this Stratton compact in the pochette provided please”.  Stratton’s patented self opening inner lid with the Stratton compact in hand logo.  Mirror with frame marked, “Stratton made in England”.  Spiral base.  Likely dates to the 1950’s.  
An excellent addition to a vintage Stratton collection or vintage compact collection.  A nice holiday gift.
DIMENSIONS
This Stratton compact is approximately 3” in diameter by 5/16”.
CONDITION
Nice and clean with no powder residue.  Some small spots of tarnish.  The mirror is functional but does have a bit of a fog.  Please see photo four.  Sifter and puff are present and in good condition with no evidence of use.  The black felt pochette is in good condition with some loose threads.  The push button clasp and self opening mechanism both work well.

4112,Vintage Stratton Compact Boy Meets Girl Signed Foster Unusual Clam Shell Shape Original Puff Sifter Ideal Collectors Piece Use Display Gift!,"
            Lovely vintage Stratton face powder compact with early to mid-1970s retro feel! Boy meets girl in a floral meadow, lovely colours, now a hard-to-find design. Signed ""Foster"". See matching lipstick holder on the shop link below.
Unusual clam shell-shape and vibrantly coloured enamel lid. The condition of the enamel is good with faint background scratching at certain angles. The gold-tone metal is bright and shiny, the base having some shadowy dark areas in places. The base has the engine-turned stars pattern and Stratton name. The catch is strong.
Inside, the metal has a few minimal age-related pin-prick marks. The circular mirror has a ring opacity (foxing) (image 3) although an image can still be seen quite clearly. The powder tray has quite a large amount of partially-used solid face powder. The original puff is thin and well-used, being heavily powder-stained and the topper bearing the Stratton signature has become detached. The powder sifter is present and heavily powder-stained. The compact may also be used with loose powder.
Please see all images using the zoom.
SIZE:
Approx. 3ins at the widest point.

4113,Vintage Powder Compact - Art Deco Compact - Downton Abbey - Antique Compact - Guilloche Enamel - Gift For Her - English Rose Enamel Compact,"
            This sweet vintage powder compact in creamy beige enamel and floral guilloche will bring a 1930s vibe to your latest look. It boasts 2 pots, one for powder and one for rouge, and a shiny metal mirror. Some of the rouge and original puff remain along with the powder sifter and signed La Mode puff in this ladies compact.  I believe this Art Deco compact is gold plated and the inside is almost perfect. It was made by the Ripley & Gowen Company of Attleboro, MA.  Please take note of the beautiful metal work under the rouge pot which is the base of the intricate guilloche.  The tiny pink and green Attleboro Roses are exquisite and help to make this romantic enamel compact a wonderful gift for her for any occasion.
This petite beauty measures 2"" or 5cm square.  The damage to the guilloche is visible but, I think, just adds to the charm of this shabby chic vintage vanity. It is a highly collectible piece even in it's less than perfect condition.  The flaws also enable me to offer this antique compact treasure at a very affordable price.

4241,Vintage beautiful top opening handbag vintage leather chocolate brown - 50s Purse - Vintage 1950s Kelly Style Handbag,"
            A timeless classic, this lovely bag is in the Grace Kelly style of bags.
The exterior is chocolate brown with a strong spring clasp and twin handles.  
Inside is a luxury suede finish with a satin purse and a zipped pocket as well as an extra pocket.  Plenty of room for all those essentials.
This bag makes a statement it is generous in size, superbly proportioned and a stand out piece of craftsmanship.  The interior did have a makers label which unfortunately over time has gone.  I suspect it was very high end manufacturer.
This is a vintage bag and has had a life therefore there are a few scratches on it and some rubbing to the side edges, however these are hardly noticeable. 
This is simply a classy handbag for a very unique classy person.  The measurements are approximately 30cm in length, 22 cm in height (excluding the handles) and 8cm in depth.

This is a cool old ""pleather"" bag. I'm not sure what decade it is from, but it is definitely unique. Overall, nice and clean quality. The ""stitching"" on front is fake--just dotted lines. The macrame accent on the strap and around the body is a nice unique touch. Zipper on top works. No inside pockets at all.

4354,Vintage Samsonite Red Hard Shell Slim Briefcase Attache No Key - Rare Retro- VGC,"
            This is the first ""Red"" Samsonite Hard Shell Slim Attache this shop has had the pleasure to list. About seven months ago I acquired a baby blue hard shell slim Samsonite attache. Before then I had never seen these Samsonite in anything but grey, brown, and black. That acquisition got me started looking for more colorful Samsonite attaches. The baby blue case has sold but since then I have acquired other colors such as pink, red and misty green. It turns out these are very popular so it's unlikely this will last long. So far I haven't found any more of these to acquire but I am looking. In the meantime it may be a while before we can list another.
This is a very unique red textured hard shell slim Samsonite attache / briefcase with silver trim. It is very similar to the first briefcase I owned which was a gift from my Aunt when I graduated from law school in 1976. Mine was ( and Is- I still own it) a medium grey textured hard shell. I've seen plenty of these cases since I started practicing law but this is the first one I've seen in pink. Most are grey, brown or black. 
This case has silver trim with dual keyed latches. The latches have locks and will open and close but there is no key. The interior lining of this case is as unique as the exterior color. It appears to be a pattern of red sunflowers on a dark blue lining. That pattern might take this bag back to the 60's but I am unable to verify the exact age. There is a fan file inside along with a zippered pouch the same red color as the exterior. 
Dimensions:
Length: 17 inches
Height: 12 inches
Width: 2 3/4 inches
Condition:
This case is in very good condition. It has no rips, tears or holes and is structurally sound. This case is in much better condition than many of the Samsonite bright color cases we sold. However, there are some scuffs and scratches on either side that appear as a white color against the pink exterior. There are also a some marks and peeled  chrome trim. Please see photos for best depiction of the condition of this case.
Although, I recently sold this baby blue Samsonite

           depth  12.5 inches  (32cm)
           base  17 inches  x  9 inches  (43.25cm  x  23cm)
I come across only a few of these types of English Briefcase's/Doctors bag but I have never seen one in this colour ever. It is a pale caramel colour and very much a stand out piece in the hand with over sixty years patina dripping from every inch and a beautiful English made lock looking pristine which remarkably still has it's original key accompanying it! A real rarity. The mechanism works oh so smoothly.
In the past, we have sold some examples of this style of briefcase where people want to use them as part of a vintage display and there is nothing wrong with that but this case will provide good service for a long time to come if wanted for daily use. It has had all the products we use to enrich and nourish the leather and of course I am biased but when a shining example such as this shows up and I measure it against brand new similar types of the same value, there is no comparison and thank goodness for 'Etsy' for a platform to find an appreciative buyer who may feel the same?

4599,"Hermes scarves 1965 ""the keys""","
            Beautiful and enveloping HERMES scarves ""Les Cles or Les Clefs (keys)"" by Cathy Latham.
100% silk Made In France of 1965.
The design of this antique key from which reprises the name cravat, their layout is circular and around have a khaki edge with another banker brown colour, the background is white with gold and silver keys.
This is the scarf only non-signed by the artist.
What makes it unique and expensive? 5 REASONS WHY YOU ABSOLUTELY
1: Let's start from the fact that it was designed by Cathy Latham-Audibert in 1965 and is the only non-signed by the artist.
2: this model is one of the Top 10 best-selling Hermes scarves of all time.
3: only the first two projects have no signature (Cles and Vendanges). Afterwards, he signed his designs as "". Caty. "" For ten years before moving to the signature as ""Latham
4: his popularity was great and for this reason it has been reprinted numerous times.
5: the last factor that justifies the price is the preciousness of the article the fact that next to the name Hermes there is the ""C"" that was put later with reprints. In fact this is what came out first and it is obvious from the fact that the logo Hermes has colored background in the ""C"" but has the same white background.
This is a scarf that remains current with current trends and fashions can be easily matched with and an article that every woman would want in your closet to show class in choosing best accessories for your wardrobe.

Ray-Ban Changeables Sunglasses
While the rest of the sunglass world was stuck in constant density lens technology, a revolution in photochromatic lens technology was taking place at B&L Ray-Ban. The result would be Ray-Ban Changeables lenses in six different tint colors. All the Ray-Ban Changeables lenses self adjust to the brightness of sunlight, but they also darken an extra degree in colder temperatures. And your colder temperatures are typically found at higher altitudes where there is less atmosphere to block both visible and UV light which means that the brighter light of winter sports is taken into account and the lenses adjust accordingly.
Ray-Ban Changeables sunglasses incorporate these innovative Bausch & Lomb photochromatic lenses that react to the sun's brightness to protect your eyes in all light conditions. Regular Ray-Ban Changeables sunglasses darken to compensate for varying outdoor light conditions. Ray-Ban Super Changeables darken even more for stronger light conditions and more sensitive eyes, and both Changeables and Super Changeables filter out 100% of harmful UV rays that can harm your eyes. This change in lens density which results in the lightening and darkening is a lifetime feature of these B&L Ray-Ban lenses and will not disappear or weaken over time.
Ray-Ban Changeables sunglasses darken to 75% of their full capacity within the first minute of exposure to sunlight. Out of sunlight, they lighten half way within the first 10 minutes and about 75% within the first 90 minutes. When new, Ray-Ban Changeables sunglasses and lenses require a breaking in period of several complete darkening / lightening cycles to bring them up to their normal performance. Changeables lenses were also heat treated to make them very impact resistant, but they are not shatterproof or breakproof nor do they have the extreme scratch protection characteristic of Ray-Ban Diamond Hard lenses. B&L Ray-Ban Changeable photochromatic lenses were made to the same standards of optical excellence for which B&L was always known.
One of the rarest forms of original Bausch & Lomb Changeables lenses were the B&L Changeable Rose lenses. They automatically adjust both color and density for varying light levels, excellent for skiing, sailing, boating, and other sports that require sharp vision in all weather conditions. They appear light rose on overcast days to cut through haze and sharpen details. In brigh sunlight, they appear a warm dark gray with rose hues to give superior protection from glare and improve contrast. Changeable rose lenses provide excellent UV protection at all light levels with visible light transmittance of 65% in their lightest state to 17% in their darkest state. Changeable rose lenses were also produced in very small quantities with a full mirror coating applied to the front of the lenses which added even more glare blocking power to allow visible light absorption of 62% to 88% depending upon their photochromatic state.
Following the sale of the Ray-Ban brand to Luxottica in 1999, Bausch & Lomb ceased making Changeables lenses for Ray-Ban sunglasses and they ceased to be offered in the original form.
As an example, a vintage 1/10 12K GF indicates a frame with gold content of about 5% pure gold when you exclude the plastic parts, lenses, and screws. To be more exact, the frames are 5% pure gold, 2.5% copper for wear resistance to the gold finish, 2.5% silver to retain the yellow color of pure gold, and the balance magnetic steel in the core. The ""GF"" hallmark does in fact mean ""Gold Filled,"" but when you consider the relatively small percentage of gold the frames contain and the fact that the gold is on the surface of the frame rather than the core you can see that the GF marking is somewhat a misnomer. It should also be noted that the ""GF"" mark is equivalent to the ""G.O."" (Gold Overlay) mark and the ""RGP"" (Rolled Gold Plate) mark all used at different periods. Each of these marks implies a gold content of at least 5% by weight. In this type of plating, a layer of gold is attached to the core metal by a combination of pressure, heat, and chemicals. This is the origin of the ""Rolled"" in RGP, i.e. the gold is literally rolled or pressed onto the core metal. This method differs from electroplating in that the gold content in electroplating is less than 1% by weight. The idea behind RGP is to put enough gold on the core metal such that there will be no wear through at least 30 years of wear. Obviously the process is better than expected as we've never seen a vintage B&L Ray-Ban gold filled frame with wear through to the finish. The bottom line is that a GF finish will last indefinitely with no significant wear to the gold plating at all. Remember that a 12K gold alloy of 50% gold, 25% copper and 25% silver has a hardness rating of 160. That's pretty hard compared to pure gold which has a hardness rating of just 20.

A little background history:
1935-2005
The Arnold pen company was started  by Remmie Arnold in 1935. Remmie Arnold had worked for the Edison Pen Co and left to start his own company. He knew that their was a large market for low priced fountain pens and he built his pen company into one of the largest fountain pen companies in the world. His pens sold at dime stores and discount stores all of the country [and many other countries]. Most of his pens were priced from 19 cents to 89 cents. He did sell some pens with gold nibs, but they are very hard to find today [they sold for one dollar]. 
Most of the Arnold line were lever fillers. Pen pencil combos were probably their biggest seller. 
Although the Arnold pens were not high priced, they did come in some great colors and they were made fairly well. They have plated trim and most have gold plated nibs. The main interest in them today is for their varied colors. (Courtesy of pensandwatches.com)
After 75 years of faithful production the Arnold Pen Company shuttered the factory and closed it's doors after producing the companies final pens in February 2010.        ",4.99,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1960s

Rome was not built in a day. This famous adage, which highlights that ample time is required to accomplish great things, was brought to the English language by playwright John Heywood as a translation of the 12th century French proverb.
When in Rome… (do as the Romans do). Possibly one of the most popular idioms for travelers, and even more so when someone visits Rome, the expression originated from Saint Ambrose’s advice to Saint Augustine. Saint Augustine had just arrived to Milan to serve as a Professor of Rethoric and was shocked to discover that the clergy would not fast on Saturdays as was usual in Rome. When he asked Saint Ambrose, the Bishop of Milan, for explanation, and it was then that the Saint told him that one should follow the customs of the places one visits, adapting oneself to the people around him or her.
All roads lead to Rome. Also used widely in the Italian language (“tutte le strade portano a Roma”), this proverb dates back to the days of the Great Roman Empire, when Rome was the most important hub in the entire world. The Roman road system was so vast and efficient that one could truly say that any road would lead to Rome. Today, the expression suggests that different methods can all lead to the same outcome or solution.
To fiddle while Rome burns. Also dating back to ancient Rome, this expression recalls a legend about Emperor Nero, the gift for men, who was supposedly playing the violin (or fiddle) while a fire destroyed half of Rome in the 1st century AD. Some historians credit Nero as the initiator of the fire that he used a pretext to persecute the Christians, while others dismiss the story as a myth. In any case, the idiom is still used today to rebuke someone who is idle in the midst of an emergency.
Cross the Rubicon. The Rubicon was the river that separated Italy and the Cisalpine Gaul during the Great Roman Empire. When Julius Caesar crossed it with his army in 49 BC he started the civil war against the Senate. This is why today the expression refers to making an important and irrevocable decision, committing oneself to a particular course of action.
""Roma locuta est. Causa finita est"" - I am afraid I don't have a person to credit for this quote, though it is from imperial Rome. Simply put, it translates as ""Rome has spoken, the cause has finished"". Basically it means what the emperor says goes.
""Pecunia non olet"" - ""Money has no smell"", implying that regardless of how you get money, it all spends the same. The real value of ancient coins is that can we hold them in hand today thousands of years later , 
each coin is a small gift of history.
""Quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentes."". Virgil wrote this, meaning ""Whatever it is, I fear Greeks, even bearing gifts for men."" Really this is more of a quote, it has changed in time to ""beware strangers bearing gifts"".
You never think about roman coins anymore. It's your ancient history. But roman coins never be ancient history. The coins coming up and up! Many culture - vultures seem to be long on enthusiasm and short on taste. Some culture - vultures are throwing a wine and cheese party on behalf of some of the young dolts they have grubstaked.
Invest in your ancient history of the roman coins, these tunes are mints, all right?? take what I offer at face coin! The Ancient Past in the Ancient Present think about it - people in this time have also an history!
For ancient coins, three classes of coins exist, and these are their standard reference works: Greek coins. Historia Numorum (HN. 3. ) Roman coins of Rome.
I wish I have had  this gift of gab in the SEO-talking! You will give currency to those history in your hand. The ancient rulers cult was highly relevant to politics, society, and religion especially in the Hellenistic. World and the Roman Empire.

4904,"An authentic Judean Widow's Mite Mentioned by Jesus Christ, One of Those Pictured Here - Over 2000 Years Old!!!","
            Offered is a  very nice bronze Judean Widow's Mite coin, also called a Prutah in larger size and Lepton in smaller size; and mentioned by Jesus Christ.  The Widow's Mite is the most fascinating of the New Testament coins. The mite or was the smallest of the bronze coins in Jewish currency. This “Widow’s Mite” coin is a genuine bronze coin issued by King Alexander Jannaeus, the Great Grand Nephew of Judah Macabee and the Jewish leader of the Holy Land from 103-76 B.C. It is this type of coin that circulated in the Holy Land during Jesus’ life.
The two dominant symbols that are found on the coin are an anchor and a star with 8 rays. Occasionally Greek lettering is seen on these coins around the anchor illustrating the prevalence of Greek cultural influence that was evident during Jannaeus’ reign.
Judean coins were made by striking long, thin strips of blank metal between two dies. The first coin on the strip was then placed between the two striking dies and hit with a hammer. The strip was then quickly pulled until the next coin was in place and the process repeated. When the strip was completed the coins were cut apart.
The “Widow’s Mite” Biblical coin refers to the story of the poor widow whom Jesus Christ commended in the Temple for having given all she had, two “mites”.
""And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast In much. And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two Mites...and he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: for all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all she had.""
Mark 12: 41-44
THERE IS ALSO MENTION OF THE WIDOWS MITE IN LUKE 21: 1-4
There are 2 different Widows Mites.
Lepton Widow’s Mite 103-76 BC (Widow’s Mite “lepton” as mentioned in scriptures) minted under Alexander Jannaeus
Prutah Widow’s Mite 103-76 BC (Often currently referred to as the Widow’s Mite but was a larger coin with similar markings to the lepton( minted under Alexander Jannaeus.
These coins were minted by the Maccabees in Jerusalem and used in Jerusalem during the life of Jesus and the disciples. It was the penny of that time period and is famously mentioned in the New Testament.
There are no two coins of this kind alike! They were minted by hand over 2000 years ago and were in circulation for many years, causing many Prutah and Lepton coins that are found today to be in poor condition.  The coin you receive will be one of the coins pictured here.  Enjoy, what a great gift idea!.  Like all my ancients this will come with a Certificate of Authenticity and lifetime money back guarantee, so buy with confidence!        ",21.00,5.0,"Vintage item

4913,Irish Christmas Gift Stocking Stuffer Half Penny Halfpenny Ha'Penny Coin (2nd Bonus Coin FREE!),"
            'Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat. Please put a penny in the old man’s hat. If you haven’t a penny, a ha’ penny will do. If you haven’t got a ha’ penny, then God bless you.' 
Among many ‘country’ Irish, the ha’ penny is a traditional little Christmas gift and a gentle reminder of a lesson not to be forgotten: Be thankful for what you have for there is always someone with less. 
The half penny is also a potentially valuable little gift. The bronze ha’ penny was issued only 16 times between 1928 and 1967 and it is no longer in circulation. It is a rare coin and it will, most likely, continue to increase in value over time. 
After decades in circulation, all our ha’ pennies have the expected amount of scrapes, scratches and weather marks but none are bent or badly dinged. No coin has been cut, pierced, drilled, machined or altered in any way which might diminish its current or future value. 
At the same time, each coin has been gently hand cleaned and lightly hand polished. As a result, each coin has an ‘aged’ luster which nicely highlights the original 1928 Percy Metcalfe 'Sow and Piglets’ design on the reverse side of the coin and the iconic Celtic harp on the observe side. 
As a desk ornament, golf ball marker, necklace pendant, key chain fob, wrist bracelet charm or just as an every day lucky pocket piece, the halfpenny is a unique and memorable keepsake or gift, particularly for anyone with even a little bit of Irish ancestry or interest. 
OUR SPECIAL BONUS: We believe in the Irish Penny tradition. And so, we will send along a second 'thank you' halfpenny with your purchase. Your additional ha' penny may be from a different issue year and have a few more scrapes and weather marks but is FREE. So, God bless. 
NOTE: Your halfpennies will be delivered in a beautiful little velvet coin pouch. We can also provide an elegant gift box. (See photos.)
The little pouch is deep green velvet – not velour or velveteen. Each two-by-two-and-a-half inch pouch is large enough for a few coins and perhaps some other personal keepsake. Truth be, our little velvet pouch is a memorable keepsake itself. 
The ‘white swirl’ gift box has a 'soft' fiber bed and is about three-and-a-half inches square – large enough for the ha' pennies, velvet pouch and a personal note or card.  
(See PACKAGING OPTIONS for pricing.)
And just so you know, with every Irish halfpenny we also send along our best wishes and an everlasting bit of Irish luck… which certainly can’t hurt in these days and times.

            This Queen Anne Victorian Double Bay San Franciscan Row House Dollhouse is a collectible gem!  The house is wired 12 volt.  It was created by a local Wisconsin woodworking artist.  He modeled the dollhouse from a picture of a real house standing in the historical district of the city of San Francisco.  The original houses in this district are today sometimes referred to as ""Painted Ladies"".  Indeed it is pictured in the book called Painted Ladies.
The dollhouse is made of wood and has interior framing like a real house.  It is in mint condition.  Overall the height is 52 inches high by 24 inches wide by 18 inches deep.  The entire front façade opens on brass hinges that are on the left side as you face the dollhouse.  The two garage doors open as well as a door under the porch stairs and the two front house doors open.  The eleven windows are double hung with plexi glass inserts that look as though they open and close.  
No detail is spared on this dollhouse.  All the corbels, Victorian gingerbread trim, tapered front door columns, scalloped fish  scale tower shingles, lightning rod on top of the asphalt roof shingles, under eaves trim,  inverted green shell trim above the front doors, transom 'leaded' window above 'leaded' front doors, eight pane each windows on the garage doors, handrails on porch steps as well as a horse head hitching post,  wood siding, porch wood plank floor, medallions, brass letter plate slot and brass doorknobs, and is painted in a soft gold historical color.
And, that's just the outside!
Oh, by the way the dollhouse can sit flat on a table ( it has small round rubber buttons on its bottom) or this very special dollhouse can be hung (hooks on the back) on a wall as you are seeing it in the pictures.
Now, as I said the entire front hinged façade swings open to reveal the interior.  There are four rooms, an attic and the interior of the garage.  The fourth room is of course, the foyer that the front doors open into.
The dollhouse is wired 12 volt via a transformer and a cord that comes out of the back of the house with a rocker switch to turn the lights off and on without plugging and unplugging the cord from your real house outlet.  So, the lights that come with the dollhouse are all the small bulbs that are ceiling mounted toward the front of the rooms and in the middle of the attic and garage ceilings.  The hanging front porch light is also included.  The two chandeliers are not included.
Please note that there are pictures, a gold wall mirror and porcelain hand painted plates, a cameo, a flower swag, a mounted butterfly collection...these items are glued on the walls and so they will come with the dollhouse.  
Two of the rooms are wallpapered and one is painted.  There is wood wainscoting in three of the rooms along with cornice and baseboard trim.  NOTE:  above I mentioned the dollhouse's overall measurements.  The interior rooms are 7 1/2 inches deep.  No furniture is included nor any accessory that might be in a picture but not expressly listed in the dollhouse description.  Please ask if you have questions.
ALSO,  I can email you additional pictures of the dollhouse inside and outside, close ups, etc.  Just ask.  Obviously the five pictures I am allotted for this listing do not show all that this dollhouse offers.
Too, as with my other shop listings I can work with you on purchase installments if you wish.  
ALSO,  the shipping charge will be determined when I find out where the dollhouse will be going.  So far, I figure I will be shipping it UPS insured and that I will have a UPS pack and ship center do the packing and boxing.
This is a one of a kind dollhouse that was not made from a kit but, was built from scratch by a skilled wood worker.  It is very unique, it is a collector's dollhouse meant to be an heirloom.        ","2,500.00",5.0,"Vintage item from the 1970s

5060,Vintage 1950's Napcoware Japan Lady Head Vase,"
            Made in the 1950's by the National Potteries Co. Cleveland,OH Made in Japan #C7313
In amazing condition for her age, no chips or cracks, age related coloring, and crazing, but still very vibrant.
When I bought her the previous owner had apparently had to re-glue the earrings on both ears---looked gross, but I just couldn't pass her up in spite of the flaw.
When I got her home, I took a chance and removed the earrings, and cleaned the area and re-glued them, one ear looks good, the other one does have some discoloring around the earring, the ear itself.  I think the old glue was on so long it stained the ceramic.  I do know that many of these head vases, over time the jewelry does present problems, missing or broken.  I feel because of her age and beauty, she is still worth being displayed by the collector, and you have to really look to see the earring issue.  The earrings themselves are fine.  
     
Please zoom in on all pictures, looks to have been only displayed, inside clean.  
She is a little over 4"" tall, and approx. 4"" wide, inside dimensions 2"" circumference at top of vase.
I love the way she looks, her dress is a deep teal blue, not navy as it may be showing on your screen, and it really brings out the color of her eyes. Her lips are beautiful, she looks so feminine.
She is not glossy, all matte finish.

            Antique Piano Scarf - Fringed Piano Shawl - Embroidered Black Shawl - Vintage Piano Scarf - 1930s Piano Shawl
Of all the vintage items that have passed through my hands over the years, this is one of the most beautiful!
This stunning piece has been lovingly packed away for decades, hence is in immaculate condition.  Made in the 1930s in either Italy or Spain this piece has breathtaking embroidery in vibrant shades of pink and green against the black silk backdrop.  Piano scarfs like this would lay over the top of a grand piano on Downton Abbey as well as being draped around a fashionable woman back in the day.  The body of this scarf measures 49"" x 49"" and the fringe is 18"" long all around!  It actually has some weight to it.  It is in nearly new condition because of the amazing care the owner took of it.  This is a rare and unique piece.

5199,"Antique Tambour Lace Parasol Cover, 39"" x 35"" Oval, Victorian Lace for Home Decor, Costume Use,  Textile Lace Study or Cutter Piece","
            This is a lovely Ecru Tambour Lace Parasol Cover from a Victorian era lady's parasol.  It has been, rather mercilessly, run through the washer and dryer, just to see if it was up to the challenge ... and it is.  There is a center hole that would have slipped over the point of the parasol, held in place by the umbrella's finial.  The lady's maid would have tacked it down with discreet stitches so it was held in place.  It would have been used as a fancy upgrade to an existing parasol for special occasions.  As ladies no longer carry parasols, ahem, it is ready for use in your creative project.  It could be used to make a stunning neckline ruffle for an off-the-shoulder bridal, evening, or historical reenactment costume dress.
This parasol cover is decorated with an exuberant collection of leafy, vining scrolls, swoops, and curlicues which continues out in concentric 'circles' to the slightly scalloped edge.  Being an antique piece, it has some stains, four areas repaired by darning, and some breaks in the tambour netting; all of these are in line with its age.  As to be expected, the most damage is at the very center of the piece, where it would have been handled the most.  It is oval in shape, rather than circular.
This item will ship out in a rigid cardboard 9x12 mailing envelope, sent via USPS First Class Package Services.  It is possible to send multiple lace listings in the same envelope, so please convo me prior to purchase if you wish to do so.        ",55.00,5.0,"Vintage Supply from the 1800s

This means that you can use the images for most web applications (such as blogs, websites, newsletters, etc.), printing projects such as scrapbooks, digital transfers, greeting cards, invitations, tags, jewelry, photo accessories, and whatever else your imagination leads too. They are particularly well-suited for digital collage, decoupage, and digital scrapbooking.

A quality and totally gorgeous vintage print of your favorite classic car!
This print is 35 years old.
    * Up for sale is: 1981 print of a painting by William J. Sims: (following written at time of printing, 1981) ""1963 Studebaker Avanti. In the early 60s, Studebaker Packard Company president Sherwood Egbert knew his company was in serious trouble. The Avanti, a dramatic departure from the Studebakr's family sedans, was his attempt to avert the company's imminent demise. Limited production of the Avanti, along with its coke bottle profile, facilitated the use of fiberglass for the car's body. The interior, an innovative design, resembling aircraft flight decks, featured an array of instruments, control levers and overhead switches. The Avanti was chosen a Milestone Car for its innovation, engineering and performance, which was admirable: At Bonneville Salt Flats races, Avantis set 72 speed records. Although Studebaker Packard's financial problems caused production to cease in December 1963, the Avanti was so popular that a group bought that division of Studebaker and moved it to Canada..."" This description was taken verbatim from what was written when these prints were made. It appears sometimes they did not get all the facts correct. The following was sent to me via email: ""In your ad decription you stated that the Avanti division of Studebaker was purchased and moved to Canada. This is incorrect. It is true that Studebaker did move it's production facility to Canada but no Avantis were ever built in Canada. Nate Altman founded the Avanti Motor Corp. and continued to build the Avanti in South bend Indiana. The car had the same basic design as the Studebaker models, but the hand built ones beginning with the 1965 model had Chevy engines. The company was eventually sold and production moved to Youngstown, Ohio.""
    * Approximate overall size is 23.5"" x 13.5"". Nearly Two Feet wide! .
 
    * Signed: by the artist in the print. These were printed to go along with the calendar printed for 1981. v

5377,Antique Portrait Miniature Madame Recamier French Directoire Miniature Watercolor Miniature on Ivory Georgian Miniature Framed Paintings,"
            Beautiful, antique framed watercolor painting on ivory.  A Georgian miniature of Madame Recamier and it is signed.  This gorgeous watercolor is hand painted on ivory and is framed in its original wooden frame.   Although it depicts Madame Recamier from the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was probably painted sometime in the mid-nineteenth century.
The miniature measures 6 cm (2.25 inches) across and the frame measures  12 cm (4.75 inches) across.  The miniature is behind glass and was bought at auction in Paris.  The signature is small and faint and difficult to make out with any accuracy.    The frame is in dark wood with a brass detail around the painting.
A top quality miniature of the Madame Recamier, shows her wearing a white gauze gown with a  pink ribbon in her hair, reminiscent of the portrait done of her by David.  The miniature is in excellent condition.

Picked these up at an estate sale about 10 years ago in Mississippi, the original labels are still on the back of the cards from McRae's Dept. Store which was purchased by Saks I think in 1994. These barrettes are beautifully made, with lovely detail and are marked Made in France on the back. 
The pearl is of course a faux pearl, the gold detail on either side of the pearl is oak leaves and acorns, very cool. 
The barrette measures 2 1/2 inches wide by 1 inch tall at the widest point. 
Incredibly, there are no marks on the pearl at all, looks like it was never worn. 
Questions are welcome, thanks for looking, and I have one more listed that is a silver bow shape with a faux pearl.        ",17.00,4.974,"Vintage item

5611,1900's Tall Antique Tortoise Shell or Celluloid 'Peineta' Spanish Hair Comb-for 'Mantilla',"
            This is circa early 1900's antique tall hair comb usually associated with Spain. The description says 'tortoise shell or celluloid' but is either of the two. My description of tortoiseshell is due to the fact that the top part of the comb has been painstakingly carved by hand. The design has been meticulously carved to come up with this intricate design. However, it is also a time when celluloid was at its last stage of usage and soon after the use of celluloid would be replaced by the new plastic invention called Bakelite. This came as an antique piece that have come from England but is most likely a hair comb that was made in France (as per my readings from other sellers) and has been made to cater to Spanish customers. The scroll design very much reflect the intricate design of Spain. The center of the top piece of the comb also suggest the shape of a family crest.
This comb is called 'peineta' in Spanish (similar to the way it would be pronounced in English: pei as in pay (ex: payment); ne (as in Netherlands); ta (as in talcum). A 'peineta' cannot be understood without understanding the word: 'mantilla'. The Spanish alphabet consist the letter 'll' (double letter L) and is called 'elle' (pronounced as in: el, ye). The 'peineta' is thus a Spanish or Spanish-influenced decorative hair comb that traditionally is used to hold the 'mantilla' (pronounced as: man-ti-lya or nearest is man-til-ya) which is traditionally a veil or shawl made of lace or silk. An adaptation has occurred afterwards where the peineta is used on its own without the mantilla. The mantilla covers the comb or peineta giving a certain perceived height to the wearer although my analysis suggests that a mantilla over the head does not always need the use of a 'peineta' since a peineta cannot alone support the weight of a long veil and thus some adaptations has been used. We also have to remember that women centuries ago normally had very, very long hair which would help support the peineta and the mantilla. Growing the longest hair was a source of pride amongst those women.
There are dress codes as to the length of the mantilla which can be below the hips or up to floor length. This is more appreciated if one observes the traditional flamenco Spanish dance. There are also social, political and religious significance in the use of this 'peineta'. Further research points to the fact that the wear of 'peineta' and 'mantilla' started in the warmer regions of Spain in the late 16th century and became popular with women in the 17th and 18th centuries. Renaissance Spanish painter Diego Velasquez and 18th century painter Goya depicted the mantilla in their paintings. Queen Isabella II of Spain who reigned from 1833 to 1868 revived the use of mantillas.
Traditionally, the peineta and/or mantilla is a symbol of power, status and position in society. There are 'privilege' rules in Spain as to the use of the mantilla. The use of black or white mantilla was the privilege of the Spanish queens and the nobles. Black mantilla is used for the Holy Week or as an audience to the Pope. White mantilla is reserved for weddings. Black mantilla is for married women and white mantilla is for single women. Today in Spain, the peinetas and mantillas are still used for bullfights, Holy Week, weddings or for an audience to the Pope.
Spain was a country that was attributed to the spread of Christianity in many parts of the world. In many colonised countries of South America and in Asia particularly the Philippines (its population is predominantly Roman Catholic, Christianity was adopted in 1521 and the country is named after King Philip II of Spain), the tradition and influence on the use of 'peineta' and 'mantilla' are very much present. Although, high towering mantillas were not used over the heads of the women, the much smaller version of the mantilla which we would call the veil was used by women as they enter the Church. The use of the mantilla as a shawl is also featured in Spanish-influenced dances. It seem to show that the use of mantilla as a shawl was adapted to the native costume of the Filipino women. Tradition dictated that women cover their heads with a veil upon entering the church and while attending the Mass. The veil was folded as one exited the Church. This tradition was still very much in practice till the late 60's. The practice discontinued but recently I have noticed that women are starting to use veils again (in Australia) while attending Mass. 
The use of 'peineta' is a symbol of status in society in many colonised countries. Women who belonged to wealthy families and whose families would have influential connection to the Church would wear the 'peineta'. The Spanish Galleon Trade in Manila portrayed one of busiest ports in the world from the 1565 to 1815 and thus enabled the exchange of goods coming from the 'natives' (a term used  in the study of colonised countries referring to the indigenous people) of the Phillippine Archipelago, China, India and other parts of Asia. These goods were shipped via the galleon ships to Acapulco, Mexico which were then shipped to Spain. These goods eventually ended up in Europe and vice versa. The opening of the Suez Canal also enabled wealthy people to travel for the first time and thus helped in the exchange of goods between the West, the Far East and other Asian countries. 
Many of the heirlooms including peinetas that belonged to women of high status in Philippine society are still treasured today and kept within the family. Many of these antique peinetas are displayed in museums in different regions of the Philippines. Some antique peinetas are made of solid gold, tortoise shell, horn, pearls, ivory etc. Indeed, the 'peineta' (and the 'manitilla') have come a long way. If one searches the story of the 'peineta' in the South Americas, the story of the peineta and mantilla would be very similar. The peineta (and the mantilla) is one of Spain's legacy to the world.
This 'PEINETA':
This large 'peineta' is circa early 1900's. It could be made of tortoise shell if not celluloid. Whatever it is, this is an authentic piece belonging to that era. The colour is brown, not too dark, not too light. This antique piece bears some signs of slight use and wear commensurate to its age and thus should be appreciated more for it. The top of the comb has been carved painstakingly by hand. The result of this hand carving is therefore irregular which distinguishes it to other forms of peinetas that are more regular in pattern that suggest it is pressed rather than hand carved such as this.
The design suggests Spanish-influenced design which is probably Baroque or Rococo design. The middle part of the design suggest to me a blank shape for a family crest. There are very slight signs of minor and negligible scratches on the obverse and reverse side which confirms to us its use and age.This is a hard material although the comb portion has some form of flexibility. All intricate branches of the scrolls or the overall design are ALL intact. There are no broken parts.
This 'peineta' is a one-off piece in my collection and is in very good antique condition. It deserves to join your collection or possibly use it for your special occasion together with a 'mantilla'. Please take the time to examine the pictures shown.

A FEW WORDS ABOUT WEDDING HANKIES
Vintage white and ivory hankies that are popular today with wedding parties were produced primarily in the 1940s and ‘50s in places like Madeira, Switzerland, and the Far East.  Embroidery, applique, drawn work, application of lace, and hemming were usually done by hand, often by 2 or more women who would each apply her speciality to the piece.  Sold primarily in Europe and the United States, ladies would always have a clean white hankie at the ready to dab noses, catch tears, or clean a spot off Junior’s face.  It’s said that no lady would let her maid launder her hankies.  (I wouldn’t know, of course.  I’ve never had one - a maid that is.).  Each evening she would wash that day’s hankie in scented facial soap, then smooth it out on her mirror to dry where it would cling until morning.  Try it yourself.  It really works.  Or tell your maid.        ",23.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1970s

5955,Beautiful B Initial Monogram HAND MONOGRAMMED Handkerchief Hankie UNUSED Vintage Stock Bridal Wedding,"
            Made of crisp cotton and measuring 12” sq with hand rolled and stitched hems this beautiful vintage handkerchief features  a gorgeous B  monogram  (approximately 3”x3”) created using a variety of hand embroidery techniques;  Running and satin stitch as well as shadow work. (Shadow work is a term used to describe the effect created by placing decorative stitches on the reverse of the fabric, thus creating a ‘shadow “ on the fabric face.)
Dating to the early 1980's when beautiful handwork items of superior quality were still being produced in China.  In the past 30 years or so machine embroidery has become the standard and alas the artistry of hand embroidery is slowly fading into oblivion. It was acquired as part of a large stash of handwork  linens  I acquired from a warehouse in Hong Kong some years ago.  
The handkerchief has been specially folded, tied with white satin ribbon and placed within a protective crystal clear pouch. It is accompanied by a descriptive insert,  with the quote, “Sometimes the best things do come in small packages.” 
A limited quantity of these unused vintage stock heirloom hand embroidered handkerchiefs exist, and it is my pleasure and privilege to offer them for you for your collection or special occasion event.  They do make particularly lovely wedding gifts/favors!
Please check my other listings for additional monograms available.

            Thanks for looking at this CaseConcept2000 creation!!
All CaseConcepts wood comes from reclaimed barns, mills and farm houses around southern Michigan and northern Ohio and Indiana. Most of the structures wood we use dates back to the 1800’s. All the wood is cleaned, sanded and sealed but we leave the wonderful look of the wood by keeping the rough sawn marks, nail holes, nails and other imperfections that give this wood its great character and makes every piece we make one of a kind.
The wood being used is reclaimed barn wood that is sealed with 2 coats of poly to help protect the wood in case your dog is a sloppy drinker ;). 
The legs of this feeder are made with 1/2"" black industrial piping. All 1/2"" feeder pipe legs are prepared with 2 coats of primer. The legs are then coated with 2 applications of paint.

X-Large Option:
The bowls are 9"" stainless steel that hold 96oz (2721g) Easy to clean, dishwasher safe. Works with wet and dry food, water. Rustproof finish.

6101,"Custom made to order small animal cube (hamster, mouse)","
            This listing is for one custom order small animal cube. You can choose both the fabric and the fleece to produce something that fits your tastes. 
As the fabric I have to hand changes frequently, please message me to see your options. I can often make items from fabrics I already have within a few days. If I have to order the fabric in then it will take slightly longer. 
Please note I do not make items out of prints such as Disney characters etc. These are very expensive and therefore would not prove cost effective. 
This cube, which is ideal for hamsters and mice is approximately 5"" wide, and 5"" high. It comes fitted with hanging tabs, but can also stand freely if you do not have somewhere to hang it from. 
It is made with a fabric outer and fleece inner, with a hidden middle layer of polar fleece.
Most custom items shipped within a week, often quicker if I have the fabric in stock.
If you plan to order multiple items please contact me as I will make a custom listing to make sure the shipping is the lowest it can possibly be :)
I additionally make other cage items, and welcome custom orders.I can make a complete set for any cage you have (see pictures for a set up I created for the double critter nation) If there is something you would like but do not see please get in touch and I will be more than happy to create a custom listing for you.

6158,Dog Car Seat,"
            OVERVIEW: WHY CHOOSE SAFETYFUR'ST?
_______________________________________________________________________________________
1) The SafetyFur’st car seat was created specifically for small dogs. It is not merely a scaled down version of a generic pet product.  This car seat is designed to meet the unique needs of small and teacup breeds.  The car seat in this listing is recommended for dogs below 9 pounds.  For dogs weighing 10-15 pounds, a larger model is listed in my shop.  If your dog weighs more than 15 pounds, I would recommend the Pupsaver line of car seats which is available through Amazon.
2) In an accident or sudden stop, the high front panel of a SafetyFur'st car seat works like a catcher’s mitt preventing your dog from being thrown from the car seat. Most other dog car seats rely on a harness or collar to restrain the dog which concentrates the impact of the collision on the dog’s chest or neck making them inappropriate for the delicate bone structure of small dogs.
3) In the SafetyFur’st, the dog is restrained by the foam padding rather than a harness, so the impact is spread evenly across the dog’s body. The purpose of the harness tether in the SafetyFur'st is to prevent the dog from roaming. 
4) The SafetyFur’st car seat contains no hard parts to injure your dog in an accident. It is made from fabric and a mixture of foams.
5) The SafetyFur’st car seat requires no installation—simply wrap the seat belt around the car seat and close the Velcro tabs around the seat belt.  Then, attach the tether to your dog’s harness and you and your furry friend are ready to travel.
6) The SafetyFur’st car seat is designed to provide some protection even when used without a seatbelt. Most dog car seats work only when properly installed, which can lead to inconsistent use. When used without a seatbelt, the weight of the SafetyFur’st along with the nonslip bottom keeps it in place under ordinary driving conditions. In an accident or sudden stop, the car seat slides forward into the floorboard, allowing energy to dissipate. As the front panel contacts the dash, it folds over the car seat like a lid encompassing the dog in a foam cocoon and providing protection from flying debris.
7) The SafetyFur’st car seat can be used in the front seat or in the back seat.
8) When you arrive at your destination, the SafetyFur'st car seat can easily be removed from your car to serve as your dog's ""Away from Home Bed."" 
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
_______________________________________________________________________________________
The SafetyFur'st small dog car seat was designed by dog lovers for dog lovers. SafetyFur'st's goal is to make car travel safer and more comfortable for small dogs while providing ease of use for the owner to facilitate the consistent use of the car seat. 
The SafetyFur'st can be used in the front seat or the back seat. No installation is required. The seat belt wraps around the car seat much like a passenger and the tether attaches to your dog’s harness. Vecro tabs on either side of the car seat can be wrapped around the seatbelt for additional security. The bone shaped handle makes moving the car seat between the front seat and the back seat a breeze.
The SafetyFur’st car seat contains no hard parts to injure your dog in an accident. It is made from a mixture of foams with a fabric cover. The sides and the back are constructed from 1-inch high density foam. The high front panel contains 3 layers of foam strategically arranged to both cushion and restrain. On the inside, 3-inch memory foam panels surround the interior space. The base of the car seat is made from a dense 4-inch furniture-grade foam for structure and strength.
In the event of a collision or sudden stop, the high front panel works like a catcher’s mitt, preventing your dog from being ejected from the car seat. The dog is restrained by the foam sides of the car seat which spreads the impact across the dog’s body. Most dog car seats rely on a harness or collar to stop the forward momentum of the dog in a crash which concentrates the impact on the dog’s chest and/or neck making them inappropriate for the delicate bone structure of a small dog.
The SafetyFur’st car seat works most effectively when used with a seatbelt and the harness tether attached; however, it still provides significant protection when used without the seat belt or harness. When used without a seat belt, the weight of the car seat and the nonslip bottom keep it in place under ordinary driving conditions. In an accident or sudden stop, the car seat slides forward into the floorboard, allowing energy to dissipate. As the front panel contacts the dash, it folds over the car seat like a lid encompassing the dog in a foam cocoon and providing protection from flying debris. *When the car seat is used without a seatbelt, it is important to move the front seat of your car far enough forward to ensure that the car seat will contact the dash and fold over before sliding to the floor.
When not in use, the SafetyFur'st can be stored in the backseat or on the floorboard. The foam-construction contains no hard parts, so in the event of an accident, the car seat won't become a dangerous projectile. 
The SafetyFur'st is designed specifically for small dogs. It is intended for passengers weighing 9 pounds or less. The interior measures 12"" by 11"". This creates a snug fit for most dogs but leaves ample space for a small dog to sit down, lie down, or curl up in a ball.  The purpose of the car seat is to restrain the dog in the event of an accident, so extra space is not necessary or desirable.  The outside of the car seat is 14"" wide, 13"" deep, and 10"" tall. The higher front panel is 19"" tall. 
The memory foam insert facing the driver's side is lower to allow the dog a comforting view of the driver. The lower driver's side and scooped cutout also make self-loading possible for many dogs. A side pocket was added to hold travel essentials such as a harness and leash. The passenger side memory foam insert is taller to protect against side impact.
Dogs seated on leather/vinyl seats or those caged in plastic or metal dog carriers can slide around causing panic and increasing the likelihood of injury or motion sickness. The cloth and foam interior of the SafetyFur'st holds the dog in place.
The SafetyFur'st is not a booster seat. The bottom rises only 4 inches above the seat of the car, so it does not provide a continuous view for the dog, but keeping the car seat lower, increases safety and stability. In addition, while some dogs appreciate the view that a booster seat provides, many others are frightened by being suspended above the seat.
For cleanliness and comfort, a removable bedding insert in included. The bedding insert is machine washable and is filled with cotton batting and loose stuffing. It is reversible for seasonal comfort. One side is covered in soft fur and the other side in a cotton fabric. Additional bedding inserts are available for purchase.

These are some of the emails I get about my bird beds.
Hi August, 
I received Henry's bird bed today and i am ABSOLUTELY thrilled, it is wonderful!! I adore the pattern and the fabric and it's beautifully and neatly made. Henry eyed it off with quite a bit of skepticism when I put it in his cage but once I came home from work he was proudly showing me how he can walk right through it with no fear - I hope he works out that it's cuddly to sleep in too!! He even popped out through the opening in the top once!!
I'm writing with so many thanks for your customer service and Henry's beautiful bed. I just can't work out how to leave feedback for you, if I could have some advice with this that would be fantastic. Trust me - it will be 110%!!
Again, many, many thanks!!

6279,Bird Chew Toy,"
            A healthy bird is a happy bird- and these chew toys are designed to cover both!
Made from native Australian eucalyptus and your choice of either stainless steel wire or natural kangaroo leather. You also have the choice of wood pieces, just bark pieces or wood plus bark pieces. Wood pieces have been dyed with watered down food dye to provide visual stimulation for your bird while also being safe to chew!
We offer these chew toys in a range of lengths (please also let us know what kind of bird you have upon checkout so we can send you a toy with suitable sized wood or bark pieces). Our chief product tester Lori the rainbow lorikeet is currently using a long piece as a chew toy, perch and head scratcher!
Why choose our products?:
*Eucalyptus is safe for most birds, especially those native to Australia! (please check with your avian vet just to make sure for your particular species of bird though!). Plus it's a hard wood so your toys will last quite a while!
*Any metal used is stainless steel-cheap galvanised wire could cause metal poisoning in birds, so we only use metal that does not cause this!
*We use naturally finished leather to ensure no chemical poisoning occurs in your bird. We avoid string as these fibres can be swallowed and cause impactions (particularly in nectar eaters such as lorikeets!)
*Wood and bark is collected from areas with minimal to no risk of pesticide exposure
*Designs are tested by our own birds before we sell them-if they have fun with them we're sure your bird will too!
*Toys are completely handmade from natural wood branches and bark, ensuring you have carefully created and unique toys to keep your bird interested! As such, the shape and size of the wood and bark pieces in the product you receive may differ slightly from the images, but the design of the toy will be the same.        ",9.32,5.0,"Handmade item

            🐕 Solid Oak Pet Memorial Frame 🐕
Our handcrafted shadow frame is made to hold your most valuable memories of your special pet. Made from solid oak, the frame can hold a number of little treasures such as a collar, toy, paw print, picture or special message - saying how you feel about them.
The frame pictured is the one we created for our own little dog, which we want to remember everyday. 
WHAT YOU GET:
It incorporates a solid oak frame, solid wood box, hinges, clasp, backing board, front mount, collar hanger, picture mount and a professionally engraved plaque. 
Every part of the frame is carefully handmade and fully underpinned to ensure it will last a lifetime. 
SIZE:
We can make the frame to any size and specification you require for your own pet. Simple message us with all of your ideas and we will discuss size, woods, finishes etc.
The price is for a frame measuring (externally):
🐕 H: 28cm (11'')
🐕 W: 33cm (13'')
🐕 D: 4cm (1.7'')
Internal Dimensions:
🐕 H: 26cm (10'')
🐕 W: 30cm (12'')
🐕 D: 3cm (1.3'')
The frame itself is 100% solid European oak, finished with natural beeswax. The box is solid wood, finished with a high quality heirloom white acrylic paint. Internally, the backing is a dark olive green, but can be which ever colour you wish! The plaque is 7.5 cm x 2.5 cm (3''x1'') and can be engraved with your pet's name, dates etc. 
The glazing is made from high quality acrylic (perspex), which is much lighter and damage resistant than glass. the frame opens via 2 small decorative hinges, and locks using a brass clasp for extra safety.
NOTE: Please provide your personalisation in the ""Note to Seller"" when ordering, along with a photo of your choice (square or portrait works best).

This stylish and simple conical table lamp is a bestseller. Base measures 40cm in height. The diameter of the base is 9.5cm.
My work is made with native hardwood timbers that are sustainably sourced. I use a wax finish which creates a hard wearing finish and brings out the natural lustre of the timber.

Please be aware that the lamp that you purchase isn't necessarily the lamp in the picture. The grain may vary slightly, but I try to use timber of the same colour and quality. 
All lamps have a brass fitting with a switch and have passed an electrical safety test. They have a standard black flex. 
This lamp is available with a simple, but elegant cream fabric shade.You can also order a printed shade as shown in pictures. Different colours are available. It has a diameter of 30cm and a height of 20cm. The total height of this lamp and shade is 61cm.

            =  Made  in Japan
My opinion: This eraser is mainly for display though some sellers claim that it is usable (erase pencil lead).
I like erasers that clean easily without leaving eraser dust. This eraser doesn't fulfil any of those two requirements. 
This is great as an educational toy for young learners as the colors of each eraser is vibrant.        ",5.80,4.9924,"Ships worldwide from  Singapore

7192,P'Iglet Pouch- Made to Order Minky Burrowing Dog Bed with built in Blanket,"
            *If you are ordering multiple beds, please contact me for an accurate shipping quote.
*Visit here for ready to ship beds - 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/ThreeLittleIglets?ref=hdr_shop_menu&section_id=15729731
The ultimate in cuddly softness awaits your precious fur baby with our P'Iglet Pouch! If you have a burrower, this bed will amaze them. I can't begin to tell you how many humans have walked by at market, felt my beds, and then asked me with a straight face if I make them large enough for humans!
This listing includes soft and luxurious Cuddle Minky by Shannon Fabrics, transformed into a pouch-style bed that is fit for the most discerning of furries! These type beds are a particular favorite of Iglets everywhere, but any breed or species that enjoys cuddling up under the covers and sinking into a pocket of comforting softness will be thrilled to have a P'Iglet Pouch.
The P'Iglet Pouch is made to order in 3 sizes-
           Small-measures approx 19 inches wide by 24 inches deep for dogs up to 8 pounds
           Medium-measures approx. 24 in wide by 29 in deep-for dogs up to 15 pounds
           Large-measures approx 26 in wide x 31 in deep-for dogs up to 25 pounds or 2 smaller dogs that enjoy burrowing together 
~~~~Custom Sizes Available - Anything over 26 x 31 will require a removable insert and extra yardage and supplies. Here are a few custom quotes ----- 32(w) x 36(l)=145, 30(w) x 40(l)=150, 34(w) x 38(l)= 155, 38(w) x 42(l)= 195~~~~~
* It comes generously stuffed with fluffy premium fiberfill and has a band of the softest sherpa ever across the blanket's edge and now features a zipper located in the inner bottom seam for access to the fluff. The zipper allows you to customize the amount of fiberfill in the pouch, or to replace it all together if needed in a few years!
* The P'Iglet Pouch is reversible so you can get twice the use time before needing to wash it. Just flip the built in blanket over to the other side and you are all set!
* Easy Care-no need to remove inserts since the entire bed is machine washable. Just toss it in the washer and dryer on 'normal' settings/cold water preferred. Once dry you will need to give it a little massage to flatten the inner fluff down a bit, and then your little critter can get right back to sweet dreams. To preserve the look and feel of the minky DO NOT USE hot water, bleach, or fabric softener.

*To ensure quality to my personal standards, I do all of my own sewing. While most beds ship in 1 to 2 weeks, depending on how many orders I have in line, your pouch may take up to 3 weeks to complete. I will get it out to you as quickly as I can.

7577,Cold pressed coconut oil best quality premium extra virgin coconut oil natural organic coconut oil 4 oz,"
            D.Medicine Woman's best oil for organic skin and hair care or silky smooth massage! We selected this cold pressed extra virgin coconut oil because not only is it USDA certified organic coconut oil, it retains 100 percent of it's excellent therapeutic value, making it the natural healthy choice for organic skin and hair care. Works great for dry skin, sunburn, and for daily skin maintenance. This coconut oil is so light and clean, you can even use it for cooking, or internally to enjoy it's many therapeutic benefits.
No, we don't make this oil ourselves, but we do purchase bulk amounts from a local supplier right here on the Big Island of Hawaii. These folks have family in American Samoa, where coconuts abound, and working together they harvest, press, and ship this wonderful oil right here to Hawaii. They work hard to let us know when the shipment will be arriving so that we can get it right away, assuring that this extra virgin coconut oil is the freshest available!
So what makes it virgin?
What makes coconut oil virgin is that it is pressed from the coconut milk. Our organic coconut oil is produced using the wet process. Coconut milk is made first. Fresh coconut kernel is shredded, mixed with a little water, and then squeezed or pressed to extract the oil. The resulting oil/water mixture produces coconut cream or coconut milk depending on the percentage of oil. The coconut milk is then allowed to separate naturally. Since oil is lighter than water, it rises to the surface. This usually takes about 24 hours and then the oil can then be skimmed off. No heat or chemicals are needed in this process, and so that this extra virgin coconut oil retains 100% of it's original aroma and taste, along with all the good stuff that makes it such a healthy choice. And because no heat was used to extract it, it has a longer shelf life (years) and requires no refrigeration. What's left after pressing out the virgin oil is the now nearly dry coconut meat, or ""copra"". The copra is what you use to put on cake or ice cream as coconut flakes. They also use it to make less expensive coconut oil, by using heat, and/or chemical solvents to extract the last of the coconut oil. Oils extracted from the copra using this method have no taste or aroma, or therapeutic value. That's why here at D.Medicine Woman, we only recommend and sell natural virgin coconut oil.
So what about ""extra virgin""?
This is a term that was borrowed from the olive oil industry. There isn't really an ""extra virgin"" when it comes to coconut oil. A lot of folks still call natural organic coconut oil ""extra virgin"" and so we still retain the term in our description so they'll know that this is the good oil they've been searching for!
Coconut oil has the distinction of being closest in molecular make-up to your body's own natural sebum (the natural oil in your skin), making it more readily absorbed into your skin and also ideal for use in organic skin care and as a absorbed into your skin and also ideal for use in organic skin care and as a super healthy massage oil. Coconut oil also contains 47% lauric acid, second only to the amount of lauric acid found naturally in human mothers milk.
Coconut oil is fully metabolized by the body, and unlike most oils, Is not absorbed into the fatty
cells and tissues. It is an ideal carrier for essential oils allowing them to penetrate through the skin's fatty layer and into the blood where they can be most effective. Because of it's light consistency, it will not clog skin pores, making it suitable for use on dry, sensitive, or problem skin. Organic coconut oil is fast becoming the oil of choice for many applications in natural healing. We were so impressed with this oil that we now use it ourselves as one of the primary ingredients in all of our lotions and creams. Since changing over to coconut oil for our creams, we have received excellent feedback about it from our many clients who have tried it!
D.Medicine Woman's virgin coconut oil is certified organic, chemical and toxin free and has virtually no negative side effects on most people, and is easily tolerated by even the most sensitive skin. It also has an SPF 4 rating as a sunblock, and can be used as such for those that only need light protection from the sun. As a massage oil, you'll be amazed at the silky smoothness and glide. And for skin care and maintenance, there's nothing else quite like it!
If you visit our store often, then you may have noticed that sometimes we are all out of this coconut oil. We only purchase it in limited quantities, inorder to assure that we never have any ""old stock"", so that you can rest assured that what you are purchasing is the freshest available, anywhere!

            Custom Chemotherapy Care Package
Cancer Care Package
We started out making general get well care packages but we have had so many requests for get well gifts for Cancer patients that we decided to create a gift dedicated to our friends and family fighting this terrible disease.  I have had so many people say ""I don't know what to do or say"".  Let me help you with that.  Over time this gift has evolved and I find that the more personal I can make it the better.  All items are personalized and made by me just for you.  I will create items just for your friend.  No two gifts are ever alike and we send you a picture before we ship.  
This gift can include items such as:  
❤️A soft blanket with a warm message. We have hand sewn a encouraging and supportive  quote or phrase onto every blanket.  Examples:  ""I love you a bushel and peck and hug around the neck"" ""I love you to the moon"" ""Love & Hugs"" ""Hugs for you""
❤️Personalized journal to take notes in or document their journey
❤️Custom Adult Calming Coloring Pages Kit (includes coloring pages and a personalized journal) 
❤️A custom designed and hand made jar of sour lemon drops and or Ginger Chews to help with nausea and other side effects  
❤️All natural hand made bath bombs to help her relax
❤️Handmade soaps (lavender is my favorite for this gift) 
❤️We can do a wide variety of personalized items (bags, mugs, reusable water bottles etc)
❤️Quote blocks that I have made to provide strength and motivation, a custom made card as well as a variety of other items.  (Friends are like Stars and You Got This are very popular)
❤️A small floral arrangement to compliment the gift (created by me)
❤️personal card from you
❤️We include in every gift a little personalized hand made bag that we call our ""Chemo Survival Kit"" and it includes items that will come in handy while they are going through treatment.  
*All items are personalized by me.  I use my Cricut Air. 
How it works:
You place your order.  In the notes section of your order please tell me:
🌺who this going to and anything you want me to know.  Sometimes just a little information about the person allows me to really make something spectacular.        
🌺Where are we shipping this and what you would like the note to say.  
Then you will get a message from me and I will let you know what blocks I have available (don't worry if you want something specific we can make that) you can choose one and then I will put something together and send you a picture, make sure you love it and then we get it wrapped and in the mail.  This process usually takes 24-48 hours.
Shipping:
I charge a flat rate for shipping to make things simpler and to cover all the costs associated with shipping.  I ship USPS Priority 2 Day mail
I will overnight please let me know before you order and we can make arrangements for that.
Let me know if you have any questions, I look forward to putting something fabulous together for you.  
Thanks!
Kris :-)

7821,Chunky Knit Blanket Chunky Blanket Chunky Knit Throw Blanket Throw Fringe Thick Blanket Afghan Fringe Blanket,"
            Chunky knit throw blanket in almost any colors (chunky mini blanket with fringe). Features a close knit, tight knit and thick knit 3'x3' square, embellished with foot long fringe on two sides.
This particular version shown first, I hand knit with two slightly different soft, cream colored yarns. Then I added colorful, ethnic Moroccan style fringe that is a mix of neutrals and brights. Neutrals include grey, taupe, cream, brown and charcoal. Colors include yellow, pinks, purples, greens, teal-turquoise, oranges, etc. 
I departed from my usual penchant to add sparkle and bling to the tassels: Other than an occasional ""semi gloss"" ribbon yarn, the fringe in these thick knit blankets is matte :)
Hand knit with OVER 10,000 stitches by Crickets’ Creations at 
https://CricketsCreations.etsy.com/
SIZE: I use two strong, durable yarns together for the STRETCHY 3 feet x 3 feet (1 metre x 1 metre) square base.  Once I add the fringe on two ends, the blanket measures approximately 3 feet wide x 5 feet long.
The fringe yarns may vary for each blanket (I like to substitute fancier and/or subtly textured yarns whenever possible) and could include purple, orange, creams, blues, reds, greens, grey, black & more. 
This richly colored throw blanket is warm without being suffocating and is the perfect length (about 6 feet or 2 metres long including fringe) to snuggle one person. 
I originally designed this style for a photographer to use in her portrait photography business, although it would look lovely in any naturally styled home.
Not sure about what color blanket would be best?  Samples happily sent worldwide with no charge or obligation (please just message me with your name and mailing address)
My designs are exceptional quality and a great value; this blanket is strong and durable for everyday use, or can really dress up a room.
Only soft, cruelty free, designer, vintage or novelty yarns (vegan). No allergenic animal fibers.
Designed & knit in the clean, fresh, high desert air in the heart of Grand Canyon Country, USA (no perfumes, cigarette smoke or pet odors)

Rich with contrast, texture and a bold chevron pattern, this piece would add a fabulous statement to any modern space.  
This piece is made entirely of upcycled maple, alder, poplar, oak, and cedar wood.  I also used some weathered old fencing to add a pop of texture and a gray element.  I used a variety of stains and oils for the wood tones, and left some totally naked (no stain or oil) so that the natural color remains present.  
The size of this piece is 22x36.

7919,ORIGINAL Reclaimed Pallet Wood Wall Clock (Interesting Aqua),"
            Our reclaimed pallet clocks not only make great time pieces but are also a great rustic and reclaimed decoration for your home, office or space.  Featuring reclaimed pallet wood and a painted stripe from one of our 5 brand new colors from the HGTV paint color line, you will love telling time with this clock. 
This clock features the color stripe called ""INTERESTING AQUA"". 
Measures 13″ x 13"".
//////////
We use salvaged wood, which will yield variations in appearance and no two can look exactly the same.  My wife and I make each by hand, making yours a unique piece. But that is why you are here and not at ikea, right? 
This clock will have a wall hanger attached to the back. It can easily be mounted to a wall with a nail or screw. It can also sit or lean on a shelf.
The clock movements that I use are Quartz, made in the U.S.A. and they do not tick loudly. Score!
You rock.  Thanks for taking a look.

8134,Industrial / Farmhouse Pendant Light,"
            This pendant light is made from a repurposed milk can strainer. It would be right at home in any country style home, or make an impact in an industrial style space. The glow from the Edison bulb really highlights the age and patina of the funnel, and the perforated top creates an amazing light effect on the ceiling. All mounting hardware and canopy are included. If you prefer to have the light with a 110v plug, we can accommodate this as well.
For more options, stock, or custom quote, please visit our website www.distressed-design.com
*Edison globe bulb can be added in purchase options.
The pendant measures 11"" tall (the strainer itself is 9"" tall), 12-5/8"" wide at the opening, and 5"" wide at the top.
**Since the strainers are salvaged, they all have slightly different patina and may differ in size. If you are interested in purchasing more than one, please contact us prior to purchasing so we can send you pictures of the funnels we have in stock. We ask this to make sure you are happy with the look of the matching set before you commit to buy.

            SPECIAL NOTE 3/19/17 The large multi colored grey yarn, used in this hanging, is currently on back order and we are now sold out of it. I can still make these hangings but they will contain a large, solid, light grey yarn instead of the multicolored yarn. I am very sorry for the inconvenience and will update the listings as soon as our normal yarn is back.  Thank you for understanding and feel free to message me with any questions.
This cream and grey yarn boho wall hanging is made from the highest quality wool to give lots of depth and texture to your wall. Imagine how unique your space will look with this hanging in it. This is a large wall hanging and can definitely liven up any space. It looks great over couches, beds, cribs, in kid rooms, nearly anywhere! 
I am happy to customize this hanging to any color combination you like. If you need the perfect fit for a nursery or any other room I am happy to help! Don't hesitate to ask. I am happy to match colors.   I do have an add on feature (7 for36 inch and 10 for 48 inch) for all custom colors. I am happy to swap out some minor colors at no charge! Just message me and we can talk! 
**This listing at the lower price is only for 3 colors of wool. If you'd like more colors than 3 ( keep in mind 2 are the main cream and the large grey) please take a look at my other listings that contain more than 3 colors and purchase one of those for 5 more and let me know what colors you'd like. 
This hanging is large and can take on any wall space. It measures 3 feet wide and about 36 to 38 inches long at its longest points. Each one is custom made so they all have their own personalities and end length which makes them unique. If you would like one smaller or larger I am also happy to do that. 
The hanging pictured is on a 3 foot rod, but can be purchased as a bigger hanging on a 4 foot rod from the drop down options.
These make wonderful house warming or wedding gifts because they are so versatile and can go in nearly any home or space beautifully. Anyone would love to recieve something so unique and thoughtful.
Message me with any and all requests you have for customization. I would be very happy to work with you.        ",48.00,5.0,"Handmade item

            My name is Sherri . As an artist I paint  from the inside out. Each piece has a personal meaning to me. Painting frees my imagination and provides many chances for happy accident to influence the finished piece. In general most of my pieces have a lot of texture and vibrancy. Art should be touched, art should make you happy.I have been selling art on line for several years and I have pieces displayed in public and private collections all around the world. I currently have a piece display in a permanent collection at the Rochester Museum of Fine Arts www.rochestermfa.org.

            Hi, 
My name is Alex Senchenko, I'm abstract artist.
Art as such is a pure reflection of the artist's nature and inner world. I have been always qualified myself as an experimentator and a hunter for new and interesting art techniques, expressions in different mediums and materials. Each day I'm learning and explore something new to me which I test, apply and develop.
My art is a metaphor of my vision of life - positive, dynamic and simple, clear along with pureness of intense colors are the main substances of my art works, prismatic and sometimes even architectural. I'm passionate in using more bold and vivid colors to create the subject in a great intact harmony and sensation.
I try to find the balance between the exact form and abstract elements in palette knife textures, lines and layers with a great attention to details.
I believe that the art should send a message, bring positive emotions and beauty on its own way.
Life could be as colorful and beautiful, as we create it. This is my message, my philosophy and inspiration, this is my palette and my soul, this is life as I understand it.

Welcome to my online- gallery!
My name is Edelgard Schroer. I was born in Moers as grandchild of Johann Keuten, a well-known artist in the Niederrhein area. In 2003, after extensive studying and co-working with the designer and artist Jean Pellen in Düsseldorf, I opened my own art gallery. My works cover a wide range of diverse styles from abstract to even floral motives. My style is varied, I do not like to paint within the same medium.
Unique to all of my paintings, you will discover in each one a sensual expression of the joy of living.
My paintings are all one of a kind, no prints or giclees in any kind.
My gallery is located in the heart of the rural country Geldern, close to the Dutch border. Here my work is exhibited in a spacious 120qm area.
I hope, you enjoy the journey through my world of colors and I thank you very much for looking.
If you have any questions, please contact me. I look forward to your mails!
Best greetings from germany,
Edelgard Schroer

            This exquisite hand forged iron rose seems to have come straight out of a fairytale! The metalwork is extremely detailed and the petals and stem look just like the real thing, but unlike a fragile natural rose, this metal flower will be around to be admired for years to come.
This metal art sculpture could make an amazing wrought iron center piece for a wedding or special event or give it to a friend or loved one for a birthday or anniversary to complement their home décor.
Each rose measures approximately 8.5” tall and is shaped by hand in an authentic blacksmith shop in Quebec, Canada.
A name or a date can be engraved on one of the leaves.

8679,Original Large Abstract painting   24 X 48 Inches-by Artist JMJartstudio-Saturation-Wall art-wall decor - Orange painting-Oil painting,"
            Original large abstract canvas painting by JMJartstudio. This wall art measures 24 x 48 inches , it is a orange painting featuring several shades of orange , yellow and white .
My name is Sherri, I love to paint things that I love. If you have passed through my shop you will see that I like to share a little information about each piece that I paint. Everything has a story right ? Inspiration and Ideas are found in the oddest of places sometimes. Often when I think of it myself, I think I must have be crazy. But then I pick my colors begin to paint and the final piece is born. So I wasn't crazy after all. Look what this has become its beautiful bright , cheerful and sure to make you smile every time you pass by it. My inspiration the sole of a flip flop crazy right ?
This is an original piece, I would consider each one of my paintings to be one of a kind . Since it is painted by me each piece I create is different and unique in its own way .I am proud to say all my paintings are Made in America, in my studio in New York each one is hand signed by me the artist.
They are painted on high quality 3/4 inch stretched canvas with a Gallery wrapped edge. What is STRETCHED canvas ? Stretched canvas means the canvas has been stretched and secured on a wooden frame. GALLERY WRAPPED simply means the canvas has been secured and stapled on the back to give the canvas a nice finished edge.This is a great thing since you will not have to buy a frame for your painting, it can be hung up straight from the box.
What will your piece look like when you take it from the box. It will be carefully wrapped in bubble wrap to ensure its safe arrival . Did I mention that all of my pieces are fully insured so there are no shipping worries.OK back to the painting, once you remove the bubble wrap,first thing you will notice is the beautiful protective finish. I want your piece to last for years and years, it also makes it easy to dust. You will see how this finish adds to the beauty of your painting, how the sheen plays off all the texture and movement this piece is made up of.Now if you look closer, you will see how all the colors are blended, to create a rich marriage of light and dark, and how well they work together. This piece will brighten up any room sure to make you smile. .Take a look to the bottom right hand corner here you will see my signature. I sign all my pieces along with the year I created them .On occasion a piece may only be signed on the back . You wonder why ? I do this because I like to leave my clients options.the versatility of hanging your piece vertical or horizontal .This way it can be easily displayed in different areas of your home.
Alright now that you took your treasure from the box what do you do with it ? Its simple, nothing special is needed, just a couple little picture hangers and you are all set.Generally a painting can be hung up within 5 minutes. You might ask why I don't use wire on my pieces ,its plain and simple , over the years I have seen those little wires and hooks create damage.Damage that I'm not willing to risk your painting. It also will leave you that hanging versatility I mentioned above.
I think I have covered everything ,but in case I didn't I would love to hear from you. If you have any questions send them along, want to share your space, ask for a suggestion, I would be happy to see your room. Send me a photo I am always glad to help.This is my favorite part I'm going to ask a favor of you, if you would like to you to share a photo with me, of the painting hanging in your beautiful home. I would love to see it .This is one of my biggest enjoyments !! .

            Custom COUPLE PORTRAIT from SELFIE - Boyfriend gift, girlfriend gift, watercolor painting, special gift from girlfriend, for him, for men
❤ This listing is for 2 people/animals custom watercolor portrait *
( * You can see how accurate is the portrait comparing with the last image that is the original photo.)
Hello! I am Natilles a portraitist watercolor artist from Barcelona. I paint portraits with a very expressive and coloring style. My style is different because the drawing is very realistic, but the color does not, and that's what makes my paintings unique and modern :)
For people who are very hard to surprise I think that a hand painted portrait is the perfect gift. Also for wedding gifts, newborns, birthdays, 50th, 25th wedding anniversary, also paper anniversary (1st wedding anniversary) or memorials it will be a meaningful present.
You can see more examples of my custom portraits below:
https://www.etsy.com/shop/SesCaniques?section_id=13661633&ref=shopsection_leftnav_3
❤ HOW TO PROCEED
You are not buying this portrait: You are buying a portrait 100% personalized. I could paint under your instructions based on your reference photo.
Before or after buying this product (is better before), we will speak through Etsy or email. You can send me the photo that I will use to paint the portrait and also tell me when you need it. Then we talk about the colors you want to use. The high resolution photos allows me to see the finest details and is better to work with and the result is better too.
Closeup photos are good in small and medium sizes (faces and shoulders), half bodies photos (heats to hips) are better in medium sizes and entire bodies photos are good in medium and large sizes.
In my blog I explained with a visual example, the procedure to follow in case you need more information:
http://natilles.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/how-to-order-a-custom-watercolor-portrait-by-natilles/
❤ WHAT I OFFER 
The drawing will be very accurate to the picture and I will keep you informed sending photos of every step of the process. Once the painting is done, I'll send you a final photo for your approval and I can make any final adjustments. I really appreciate the criticism. My goal is that you like it so much. I will make all the changes with pleasure and your opinion always helps to make the portrait better.
❤ THE BACKGROUND, A NUMBER OF CHARACTERS AND EXTRA ELEMENTS
This listing is for TWO people/animals portrait in front of a white background or  background painted with diffuse patches of watercolor. For complex backgrounds (e.g., in a car, on a boat, in a dinning room, in a garden, a cake, etc.) you have to add this listing to your purchase: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/246505062/
If you would more or less persons or animals you can revise my shop looking for an item with the number of persons do you need, or use this short cuts:
▶ 1 person / animal
https://www.etsy.com/listing/229669527
▶ 2 people / animals 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/241699593
▶ 3 people / animals 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/167216795
If you want to add props (like people with butterflies in his hair, or a lot of flowers surrounding the face), or any photomontage, I’m happily available to do it. Also I’m available to paint other sizes or portraits with more people. In all this cases write me and I will create a special item for you.
❤ SPECIFICATIONS (TECHNICAL, MATERIAL AND CARE) 
TECHNIQUE It is painted by watercolor (high quality and of very concentrated and luminous colors). The brands I use are Holbein Artists and Winsor & Newton Artist. I also use pencil to draw.
The PAPER used is Guarro extra cold pressed. It is the best for watercolors, is 100% cotton, white color & extra thickly (350 g.) The maximum size is  27"" x 39"".
You can choose the COLORS. But there is one restriction: I NEVER paint with the real tones (the picture realistic tones). I can paint with only one color (monotone) or several; that does not change the price. I can help you with the choice if you want.
I send you the original hand-signed by me. This image will be yours forever and I will be able neither to sell it nor to reproduce it. You can not use the painting for advertising, or make copies or use it for profit of any kind. If you want the painting for something like that, tell me before and I happily sell yo the rights and the digital image.
IMPORTANT: Watercolor can not receive the direct sunlight because it will eventually clarify. The sun beams can not touch the paper.
❤ PROCESS TIME, PACKAGING, SHIPPING
If you require your painting in a certain time frame, please let me know before the purchase.
Maybe I have orders in queue before yours.
If you need a very Express shipping, you can pay the extra cost to update the standard shipping into a Express. You can add this service selecting your country here:
https://www.etsy.com/shop/SesCaniques?section_id=17043087&ref=shopsection_leftnav_2
 
(If your country doesn’t appears, tell me and I will find out the price)

8860,"Violet Perfume - Using essential oils extracted from fresh flowers, I have created a true Violet fragrance that all will enjoy.","
            Violet is fresh and romantic without being overly floral. It has sweet, sharp and crisp green notes.  Violets are considered a good luck gift to be given in any season.  
The violet, the traditional Valentine's Day flower, celebrates modesty, virtue, faithfulness, humility and possible happiness.   According to legend, the Christian priest St. Valentine wrote love notes using ink made from the violets he grew. 
As a fourth-generation perfumer, I left the industry to spend my time with family and friends.  It is my joy and desire to create new versions of traditional scents using fresh flowers that are steam-extracted at the peak of freshness to capture the pure essence of such remarkable creations.  With so many cheap imitations around, I knew there would be a market for pure, natural scents with none of the artificial additives that mass-produced fragrances use.  As a result, I have created scents that wear longer than most without causing irritation to you or others.  I try to be very allergy and asthmatic sensitive in my formulations so more people can enjoy the fragrances.  Each fragrance can be ordered in Normal, Extra, or Light concentration.  
All fragrances are mixed to order.  With natural essential oil perfume, the essence oils take about two weeks to fully open up in the carrier, making it a wonderful journey to see what the final fragrance will be.  Some of my favorite memories of perfuming was working with my grandmother to mix different fragrances and checking them each day to see what new notes I could detect.
If you wish to have an item shipped directly to a gift recipient, you can enter the recipient's mailing address during checkout and indicate that it is a gift in comments.   All fragrances are shrink-wrapped for safety.

8939,Handmade Shaving Brush with Natural Bristles,"
            This stylish Hand Crafted Shaving Brush has natural bristles and the handle is made of resin. The brush has been designed to generate extra lather that is sure to enhance your shaving experience. For best results we suggest soaking the brush in hot or warm water for a few minutes before every shave. By doing so the brush becomes softer, retains more water and generates a rich warm lather. 
The performance of a shaving brush depends not only on the quality and type of bristles used but also on how the knots are formed. Since inception we have always built the Knots in-house. The process starts with weighing the bristles to ensure that the knot size is consistent. Once the bristles are weighed we then form the knots using our proprietary jigs designed exclusively for this function. We then complete the formation of the knot by using a special epoxy which ensures minimal loss of bristles. The knots are formed in a way that splays easily allowing the brush to retain water and air needed to create a fuller lather. 
 
Approximate Dimensions: Overall height: 115 mm      Loft: 60 mm      Knot: 22 mm

            I just found this terriic vintage wind-up train by Ideal dated 1974.  The train is in excellent working condition and even plays a tune as it rolls across a table, floor or other flat surface.  This is a cousin to Mr. Machine -- another Ideal wind-up toy from the 1970s.
This train measures about 11"" x 9"" x 4-1/2"".  Its see-through construction allows you to see the gears inside turn as it rolls.  The hat atop the smokestack moves up and down as it whistles a happy tune.
Train is marked 1974 Ideal Toy Corp, Newark, NJ.  07105US Pat. No. 3763734

            Schuco Sonny 2005 Mouse in Green Car Wind-Up US Zone Germany Metal Tin Toy Collectible Mechanical 
{ p a r t i c u l a r s }
Wonderful, prized early Schuco 2005 wind-up car with balloon toting mouse driver in original box.
Desirable soft jade green color, bright red seat. Gray mouse is likely steel (magnet sticks) covered in felt and holding a yellow and red hard plastic balloon.  When you wind this guy up, he will either drive away in a straight line or around in circles, depending on how you position the front wheels. As the car moves, he raises and lowers his arms, waving his happy balloon.
Key included. 
(Possibly original, but I'm not certain.  The former owner says this is the key she believes came with this toy when her mother brought it from Germany in the early 1950s., but it does not say 'Schuco' on it. I'm not sure if the earliest keys were imprinted this way or not.)
The bottom of the car reads ::
Made in Western Germany
Import D'Allemagne
Schuco Sonny 2005
D.B. Patent  D.B.G.M
Trade Mark Registered
c. 1945-1949

We are dedicated to bringing the best quality materials, craftsmanship and love to each and every board, handmade within our own family, shared with yours. Your Child’s happiness is our goal just watches their faces. 
Each board can safely hold two grown adults each weighing 200lbs one either end while rocking back and forth like a seesaw.
The Curvy Board measures 34"" in length, 12"" in width, and 7"" in height from floor to top of curve (when laying like a rainbow). 
Curvy boards are teeter totters, balance beams, slides, and... anything else your child can dream up. This unlimited range of possibilities is what makes open ended toy an ideal 
learning toy for 21st century learning skills. 
In a world where computers “know” all the facts, it is the imagination, innovation, and creativity of the human mind that has value. It is said that rocking helps develop a child’s sense of balance and for the brain to sort sensory impressions. The value in any toy is not what the toy can do, but what the child can do with it
If you ask to ask what it is, you know it's going to require some imagination. It'll send them outdoors, get their bodies moving and inspire their minds to start racing - and that's a lot more than you can say about most toys today.
Made from 9 layers of Maple Hardwood, sanded smooth, and finished with varnish. Each board is handmade so no two are alike, each board offers its unique design from nature.

9155,Wooden farm animal toys - Wooden animal toys for kids - Wooden toy animals - Toy farm animals - Miniature animal toys - Easter gift,"
            This listing is for a set of wooden animal toys for kids.  These wooden toy animals are small enough to be easy to hold and play with.  They are simple, unpainted farm animal toys.  Your child can have hours of imaginative fun with these 10 simple toy farm animals.  The largest, the horse, is about 4.75"" tall and the smallest, the sheep, is about 2"" tall.  They are made of pine and are unfinished.  Included are a horse, colt, cow, calf, billy goat, milk goat, dog, kitty, sheep, and pig.
The wooden animals are sanded and ready to play with.  My mom has been making these animals for decades now and selling them at craft shows in Oregon.  My kids played with them when they were little and had so much fun making animal noises.  You and you child can paint them if you want to make them unique to your family and to make a fun special memory.  There are no moving parts, no batteries required.  The only noise and action will be fueled by the imagination of your kids.  None of the animals fit completely inside the choke tester so they are great for kids of all ages.  That said, there is no better way to keep kids safe than adult supervision.  Have fun playing with you kids with these great animals.
These wooden farm animals with their fabric storage bag will make a great child's gift.  Your friends will appreciate that there are no beeps, bells or whistles.  Girls and boys alike love to play with animals.  With 10 animals to play with there are plenty to share with siblings and friends.
Included with the set is a colorful fabric storage bag.  The fabric used will vary depending on fabric availability, the bag show is an example, but may be of a different fabric than is currently available. The bag will hold all the animals and would make a great gift bag also.
- 10 animals.
- Unfinished wood.
- Made in North Carolina.

9173,A Solid Body Brass Top Made On Lathe With Ni3N4 Ceramic Tip,"
            A nice solid body brass top with ceramic tip manually made by me on a lathe. On only few test spins ( I test every top)  the best time was a few seconds over 7 min, I'm sure this can be improved. The stem is thinner to help with the spin time and can be used bare, but some might not like the thin stem so I have included three little o-rings as seen in the pics which make this much easier to grip. This sale is only for the one larger top in the pic of three tops, the other two are separate tops for sale and not included.
See a video of it spinning on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF5eggmUxYM
The postage within the UK is £2.06 first class signed for but I do offer the tracked upgrade faster delivery option. I'm sorry about the high postage cost to other countries but the only safe option I have is international tracked and signed for.
Cheers, 
Rob

The expected wear and tear for a vintage item. The box has actually survived for this piece and is in good condition with all the original flaps. The flaps are creased and the box is slightly dented.

9249,Baby Receiving Blanket or Hospital Blanket Plush Bunny,"
            If you are like me- the sentimental momma- you cannot bring yourself to stow away the adorable blanket that you wrapped your baby in when they were born; but at the same time, you don't know what to do with it.  Why not let me turn it into a lovely plush bunny rabbit for you or your kiddo?!!  Pull out that memory that's laying folded up in a box and send it my way!
I KNOW THIS IS A LOT BUT PLEASE READ EVERYTHING BELOW
Okay- bottom line basics:
You place your order, select if you want just the plain bunny or add pink or blue embroidery. Once your order goes through I email you with information and the PO Box address. You mail me your blanket. I make a bunny and then mail it back. Simple as that :)
Here's the details:
So, whether it is the traditional hospital blanket or other well loved receiving blanket, I can turn it into an adorable keepsake. (Please note: The bunny pictured is an example that I made from my son's blanket. I do not provide the blanket for you, you will mail your blanket to me.)
I offer your child's name and birth date embroidered onto the bottom of the feet in a matching thread color (please select blue or pink) for an additional 10.    👉🏻👉🏻Please include in the ""Notes to Seller"" or Convo me the Name and Date you wish to be embroidered.👈🏻👈🏻   (I usually try to match the shade of blue or pink that's in your blanket unless otherwise requested).   I use premium polyester fiber fill to stuff your bunny with and embroidery floss for the nose and eyes.  Sitting down its about 11"" tall. The overall length (with the legs stretched out) is about 15"" tall. Width at its widest is about 6"". 
Once I receive your order, I will email you an instruction page with all the information you'll need to mail me your blanket. Please only send ONE blanket per bunny.  Current turn-around time is about 4 weeks. 
Standard hospital receiving blankets are usually appx. 25""x""30- please make sure your blanket is not much smaller.  If you're not sure feel free to email or convo me. 
Thin flannel receiving blankets are the best for bunny quality but if you have questions on your fabric please feel free to convo or email me.
While I do not offer gift certificates for my shop specifically, I do accept Etsy gift cards which you can purchase and then can be used in my shop. I can also email you a nice page that you can print out that has my shop name and information to give with your Etsy gift card. 
PLEASE NOTE: If you're buying this to gift to someone else please make sure that they're ready to mail me their blanket within 1 week of the order date. Etsy has a limited time allotted for me to ship the item so I need to be able to get the bunnies completed within that time frame. For gifting, the best thing to do is give an Etsy gift certificate along with my shop information. 
*DISCLAIMER ON MUSLIN BLANKET: The “muslin” blankets are very popular right now but their lightweight and slightly stretchy nature make them a difficult material to work with.  I can make bunnies from blankets like the Aden and Anais wraps but please PLEASE note the following before choosing this fabric:  the thin fabric does not hold its shape as well as the flannel so be aware that your bunny may not hold up as long.  Please do NOT send me “cotton gauze”- this is not the same as the swaddle blankets like Aden and Anais; it is much more stretchy and far thinner (I purchased some from a fabric store and learnt this the hard way).

9259,Sylveon Floppy Plush - regular / shiny version available!,"
            A super cuddly, floppy Sylveon plush!
Made from a ""cuddle fleece"" furry fabric with needle-felted eyes and other details. Inner ears made out of felt. Its paws are weighted with glass pelets and the body is only lightly stuffed, ensuring extra floppiness! Thanks to that, the plush is also poseable, as shown in the pictures. He's about 16 cm / 6.2"" tall when sitting, without the ears.
I'm able to make both regular and shiny versions, as that only means swapping the colours for me.
I am able to make other Eeeveelutions in the same style using the same base pattern. If you wish to order one of these instead, send me a message and I will create a cutom listing for your commission!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Making on demand! I will start on your order as soon as I receive the payment, but please allow me to have up to 8 weeks to finish your order. I can generally work on the weekends since I am a uni student. You can of course contact me at any time for any information about the progress of your order!
Slight variation in shape / colour may occur, as this is a handmade item.
I am okay with shipping worldwide, just send me a message so I can calculate the shipping for you! Please note that shipping overseas might take up to 21 days for the item to arrive. Priority shipping is available on request.

9288,Dragon-themed Luxury Children's Playhouse,"
            My other company is called Magical Playhouses (www.magicalplayhouses.com). I design, build, and deliver luxury playhouses for children all over the western United States.
Make childhood magical again! Can you imagine growing up with memories of playing in this? 
This playhouse was featured at the 2015 Bellevue ArtsFair and in the current (August 2016) issue of Fine Homebuilding.  It took 600 hours to build, with 150 of those in the carving alone. Material costs were close to 7k, so this playhouse is priced at 29,995, though I'm open to reasonable offers.  
Most of the playhouses I build for clients are more in the 5-10k range, but I built this as an example to showcase my abilities. That being said I would be estatic if there was a child out there who might grow up with happy memories of their dragon pkayhouse.
Now, if you worry about your children or grandchildren aging out of a luxury playhouse too quickly, I also offer a 3-year lease option to greater Puget Sound residents at 450/month, and after that period is up, you can continue month to month. We can also do lease-to-own and owner financing, if that would be more appealing. There's obviously some fine print to these options, so send me a message if you're curious and I'll send you more information. 
The Dragon is built and waiting for that special child who, like mine, is obsessed with dragons. This playhouse measures 6'8"" wide, 12'6"" tall and 10' long. It is just about as large as I can pull down the highway without moving lines, and in fact, the head is designed to be removed for this purpose.
It weighs approximately 3,000 pounds and, just like a hot tub, it can easily be craned into any backyard.
For more pictures, please visit: http://www.magicalplayhouses.com/for-sale/ 
If you are a reader of Fine Homebuilding, this playhouse will be featured in the September 2016 issue, due out in mid-July. Keep an eye out for it!
Depending on your location, and method of installation, this playhouse can be in your yard in as soon as one week. 
Features:
- Hand-carved cedar dragon heads and tail
- Insulated 2x4 walls. Broan wall heater (wired with a safety shut-off switch 52"" off the floor).

9544,Waldorf Calendar - Waldorf Steiner  Waldorf inspired education - Rainbow Gnome COLOUR DAY Days Of The Week Calendar FREE Shipping Australia,"
            Waldorf inspired education tool
✿ Waldorf COLOUR DAY OF THE WEEK Calendar ✿
✫ This handcrafted Waldorf Calendar is my top #1 best selling item of all time! ✫ 
                 ✫.•°*”˜˜”*°•.✫ THANK YOU! ✫.•°*”˜˜”*°•.✫ 
As most parents & educators would agree, young children are Sensory Beings. Our children relate to the world through their senses: the sense of sight, touch, sound and so on.
Learning the days of the week using colour therefore resonates with younger children in a more gentle and intuitive way than using numbers or names to represent each day. 
HOW IT WORKS:-
(See video here:: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO9dZJ62OoQ )
   A wonderful way to start your child's day! ::
Each gnome is the COLOUR of a day of the week, as suggested by R. Steiner. Purple is Monday, Red is Tuesday... and so follows. As the week progresses, the gnome of the day sits up on his little stage, announcing his colour ALL day.
(See my blog post for more info - http://www.hinterlandmama.com/2013/06/colour-days-of-week-waldorf-children.html)
* Original and Unique Hinterland Mama design 
* Ideal Weekly Rhythm teaching tool
* Waldorf Inspired and used in many ELC and family settings
-------------------
To make your gnome calendar into the unique, handmade treasure that will become an heirloom in your family, I personally cut a piece of beautifully scented local Camphor Laurel timber into a pod-shaped base and then carefully sand it FIVE times by hand to achieve a silky finish. 
I then hand-rub the wooden base with my own natural grapeseed/beeswax polish to seal the wood and protect it from potential stains and moisture. 
Each peg doll is gently sanded in a similar manner to match the smooth texture of the wooden base. 
The next step is to gather my teensiest paint brushes and well-worn Lyra watercolour paintbox. I lovingly handpaint each charming little gnome with his own individually coloured tunic.
The hewn holes in the wooden base are painted now, too, with the same delicious watercolours to match the gnomes' tunics, with one colour for each day of the week. The holes are then lovingly waxed and polished, as are the little gnomes, one at a time.
I then get out my sewing basket and, with the precision of the fabled shoemaker's elves, I cut tiny hats from my collection of exquisite quality, European felt fabrics. I lovingly stitch together the tiny pieces to form classicly pointed gnome hats to match the colourful  tunics.
I dress each little wooden peg gnome in his own felt cap, using natural, non-toxic glue to secure the felt to the wood in a seamless manner so that curious little fingers will be able to handle the peg gnomes without the adornment coming loose and detaching. 
Of course, as individually handcrafted items made of small parts, these peg dolls are not designed to be used as toys for toddlers. The best and safest use is for children ages 4 and up, so please use care to protect both your children and the gnome set from harm or damage.

*Dimensions~

ღ This is a representative image - Your 'Day of the Week Calendar' will look very much the same; however, its own beautiful characteristics will make it as individual as you are.
*Please note that the colours shown are as accurate as possible, but there may be some variation in computer monitors and settings.

9552,Custom Trophys Made to Order,"
            Made to order custom trophies is a new offering that we are going to try.  The examples shown were a custom order from a company for unique trophies to be presented to the winners of their annual 'Texas Hold em' poker contest and their annual 'Mardi Gras Cook Off'.
As you can see in the photos, I have pictures that show our signature technique of copper coloring metal and applying a glossy powder coated finish.  This is the same technique we use on most of our products, unless we are powder coating with a color.
The 'Texas Hold em' is 15"" wide and 15"" tall.  The Cook Off trophy is 15"" x 20"".  Both have been cut from 16 gauge metal and ground down to make the metal shiny silver.  The metal is then treated with an additive to bring about the copper tones, then treated with another additive to give it the burnished tones.  Notice the pattern from the grinding showing through the color.  Then the piece is powder coated with a clear protective coating.  It almost looks like it has a 3 dimensional depth and It changes as the light hits it from different angles.  These make beautiful gifts, too.  
So, if you have an interest in a custom trophy for an occasion or a special person, click on 'Request a Custom Order' I need is your thoughts on the matter and I will put something together for you to approve.  Once we agree, I will create it and post it RESERVED for you.
The price will depend on your design, the lettering, images, etc., and of course the size of the finished product. We charge by the inches cut.  I don't like to go much smaller in size because letters get too close and the heat of my cutting torch has a tendency to warp the lettering. When designing a whole new trophy there is a one time, 25.00 design fee. If you order again and use the Sam design there will not be a new design fee charged since it is in our system.
For a reference point, the Texas trophy sold for 55 and the Cookoff went for 50.  The shipping will probably be in the 15 to 17 range, depending on where I ship it to.  The postage is based on size and weight, and where the package is being sent.  When you type your request in be sure to add your address and zip code.  
Etsy requires us to put in a price, here in this listing. Since I don't know the final price, because I don't know what you want, I am putting in the base price of the Texas Hold em at 55 and shipping at 15.  You may want one of the trophies, as is, with just a change in the company name or no name at all.  The price will not change for that.  If you like to have card parties or have a recreation room with a card table, this is just the piece you want on the wall to let your challengers know that you are a serious card player.  Let me know what you are wanting.  After, we send you a digital design of what you have told us and a price quote, you can approve it, cancel it, or keep on working on it.
Please convo me with questions and we can start having communications toward a very unique gift or presentation that you will not find in any stores.        ",55.00,5.0,"Handmade item

Portrait of style icon Iris Apfel - as seen in the documentaries: Iris, and Advanced Style
http://advancedstyle.blogspot.co.uk 
Kirsty McKenzie's work depicts portraits of colourful characters with queer and feminist themes, defying sexual and gender stereotypes. She explores the objectification of women, and the feminine identity; interwoven with prominent themes of obsession and addiction. She infuses these topics with humour and a child-like exuberance with simplification and distortion of forms, and a brazen use of colour.

What a fantastic 1960's Retro Wall phone, model 90, made buy Automatic Electric Co with a side mount receiver. This beauty is in need of detail cleaning. The receiver is rusted as is the back, see photos 2&4. The cord is in great shape, the rotary dial spins nicely and the receiver moves well. The outer black body has many scuffs. The phone has all of its working components. I do not know if it will work as I have no way to test her.

This listing is for those who don't have the time or resources to make their own, or..  who want to support me, the designer. (thanks!)  
Assembly instructions, and a description of the process are on instructables here.
http://www.instructables.com/id/Tabletop-Arcade-Mame-Box-for-Raspberry-Pi/
This kit contains only the wooden parts, you will need to supply the guts.  In the completed picture above, the kit is shown assembled with
Raspberry Pi model B running the free PiPlay software
eBay ""60-in-1"" Dual Joystick/Button combination (including XinMo USB interface)
USB and HDMI cords, and little rubber feet for the corners.
A bit of wood glue.
The gentle angle mimics a real arcade experience on any countertop or table, and the reinforced ribs inside the box create a very sturdy and durable play surface.  It's made from Baltic Birch, and looks beautiful in natural colors or stained.
The box is shown with a normal 20-button layout, with the joystick and 6 player buttons using the standard ""sega1"" layout from slagcoin.  Drop me a line to inquire about a different layout or different number of buttons.  Most layouts are easily workable, as long as there is room for the guts and wiring harnesses.
Assembly takes about an hour using standard wood glue, and installation/wiring of the electronics takes another hour.  It's all quite easy, and can be completed in an evening or two or a Saturday.
The shipping weight is about 3lb, and your parts will be shipped as soon as they are cut!  As with any laser-cut item - it smells like burnt wood!  Give it a couple days in the garage to air out, or trust that any stain or sealer will kill the smell completely.        ",42.00,5.0,"Handmade item

10020,Witcher 3 Gwent Card Playing Surface Mat -  Cotton Sateen Cloth,"
            Do you love Witcher 3?
Do you love Gwent?
Do you own the cards but have nothing to play them on?
That was my situation and I couldn't find a suitable playing surface anywhere, so I decided to do something about it and create my very own unique playing surface! It became so popular amongst my Gwent-playing friends that I thought I'd make it available to all Gwent fans via Etsy!
I have also added a new PREMIUM version of my Gwent mat which I have made out of a high quality Neoprene 1000gsm material and fabric surface. It basically resembles a giant mouse mat (ie. cloth top, black foam rubber underneath). This makes for an excellent playing surface which doesn't require ironing, has wonderful grip on the table top, and can be easily rolled up once you are finished. This new mat can be found in my shop.
Playing mat features:
- Allows you to play your very own real-life games of Gwent (assuming of course you own the card decks already).
- The scale of the playing surface perfectly matches the official Gwent game cards.
- The play area is printed on a high quality Cotton Sateen cloth, the edges of which are folded and hemmed by hand to prevent fraying.
- Once you're done playing you can easily fold it away making it a very portable item.
- Being cloth, it's also more resilient than a paper/cardboard equivalent.
- The mat measures approx. 84.5cm x 76.5cm.
At the moment I am making these to order so there is a delivery time of 10-12 days. Trust me though, if you are a Gwent fan and already own the card decks, this mat is worth the wait! I'm also happy to post anywhere in Europe and in the US and Canada - although this might add a few days to the delivery time.
If you have any questions, please don't hesistate to ask! :)
PLEASE NOTE: THIS AUCTION IS JUST FOR THE CLOTH PLAYING MAT. ALL CARDS AND OTHER ACCESSORIES SEEN IN THE PHOTOS ARE NOT INCLUDED! YOU WILL NEED AT LEAST TWO GWENT CARD DECKS TO PLAY THE GAME ON THIS MAT.        ",51.74,5.0,"Handmade item

Playing cards were invented in Imperial China, and likely spread through Asia into Europe via the Silk Road. When cards first appeared in Europe in the 14th century, they were designed to represent European royalty and nobility. 
The figures in the face cards of this deck are inspired by real people who ruled Europe in the late medieval period. You can see all the face cards in the second image of this listing. They are as follows:
❖ Clubs Suit: 
- King: Christian II of Denmark
- Queen: Isabella of Austria 
- Jack: Norwegian pirate Elise Eskilsdotter
❖ Diamonds Suit: 
- King: Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I
- Queen: Mary Duchess of Burgundy
- Jack: Dutch philosopher Erasmus
❖ Hearts Suit: 
- King: Florentine ruler Giuliano de'Medici
- Queen: Guiliano's lover (and model for Botticelli's ""Birth of Venus""), Simonetta Vespucci 
- Jack: Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli
❖ Spades Suit: 
- King: Louis XII of France
- Queen: Mary Tudor
- Jack: French vigilante Jeanne Hachette
----------------------------------------------------
Specifics:
❖ All cards, front and back, were designed by me, Laura Inksetter
❖ 54 standard bridge-sized playing cards (including 2 joker cards)
❖ Card dimensions: 2.25 x 3.5 inches (56mm x 88mm)

10051,Embroidered Lined Drawstring Tile/Dice Bag - Made to Order,"
            Cthulhu graces the front of this large, fully lined tile/dice bag.  Perfect for holding tiles for Arkham Horror, Eldritch Horror, Arkham Horror The Card Game, etc.  The bag is 9""w x 8""h and is gusseted at the bottom so that it will stand on its own open or closed.  The large size is great for when you have to stick your hand in and fish around for tiles (I'm certainly not judging if you have every expansion to Eldritch Horror), or if you need a bag to hold all your dice collections.  An excellent addition to any Lovecraft fan's gaming swag.
This listing is made to order, please allow 2-5 days before it ships.
Made of black poly blend microsuede exterior lined with your choice of red or green satin lining and embroidered with rayon embroidery thread.

Original relief wood carving by California wildlife artist Greg Pezzoni.Carved from kiln dried pine, with the pectoral and pelvic fins carved separately and added on to give the impression of a full bodied mount. The piece is then sealed, primed, painted and then finished with several coats of high quality varnish. I use high quality species correct taxidermist glass eyes in all my carvings. The back is flat with a custom designed mounting bracket that allows you to angle the mount in any direction with only one hanging point. It also extends the mount out away from the wall giving it a more rounded 3-d look.There are felt pads that allow this feature with no damage or scratches to your wall. my signature, date, size and species name, are on the back.

10430,Theremin - Electronic Instrument - GENUINE True Analog Theremin Theramin Thermin,"
            The world’s first electronic instrument!
Most people associate the other-worldly sound of a theremin with vintage science fiction / horror movies, or bands such as Man or Astro Man that utilized the instrument in their musical mix. Invented in the 1920's (it is widely considered to be the world's first synthesizer) the theremin still seems futuristic today and is used in commercial audio & films as well. This electronic instrument is a bit unusual in that it is played by moving your hand near the antenna without actually coming in contact with the theremin itself.
************************************
This listing is for one completely assembled ""plug and play"" Theremaniacs Theremin! Theremin plugs into an amplifier with a standard 1/4 inch guitar cord. It will sit quietly until your hand is about three feet away. As your hand comes nearer to the antenna, the pitch gradually becomes higher until it is inaudible. Covers 7 octaves - from soaring high notes through great growling lows. 
Theremin is powered by a quality 9 volt alkaline (included). AC adapters will add hum and instability so we only use pure DC battery power! . One alkaline battery will last about 500 hours (several years of average use) and is easy to replace. The sound does not suffer as battery power is consumed during use. Draws only 1 milliamp, far less than ordinary effects pedal. Set it up anywhere you want! 
Theremin is assembled from common components without the use of esoteric parts that may be unobtainable in the future. We do not sand off part numbers! Some manufacturers will hide the component values they use by obliterating the markings making future repairs impossible! 
All high quality components and construction featuring a laser etched professional quality circuit board with genuine Inductor Coils in a classic Dual Oscillator Heterodyne design - Real Theremin sound and playability! 
Changeable output sound from mellow to coarse. 
Variable operating frequency and external sensitivity control. 
************************************
Only THEREMANIACS GENUINE THEREMINS are guaranteed for parts and workmanship for as long as you own the instrument! 
PRODUCT OPTION AVAILABLE! You can choose from: Screw thread Microphone Stand Mounting, or rubber foot table top style! 
METAL thread microphone stand mounting will fit ALL mic stands. (Sorry, stand not included!) 
************************************
A wiggling motion of the hand produces a vibrato effect. 
Input to a reverb, echo unit, flanger, or others will create wild effects! 
Run this through an effects rack and you will be amazed at your sonic creations! 
Thousands of Happy Customers World Wide! 
Your Satisfaction Is Assured!

            Hip hop - the most vigorous cultural phenomenon to emerge in the last three decades - was created by people growing up in housing projects around Harlem and the South Bronx in New York City. The Caribbean-style sound-system battles that took place in city parks, schoolyards, and at block parties in the 1970s were breeding grounds for the rap, break-dance and graffiti styles that now echo through pop culture worldwide.

10472,"zine - ""Not Straight Not White Not Male"" - 3rd edition","
            Price jumped because I no longer have access to free printing! I apologize if this makes my zine inaccessible to anyone. If you have concerns, please don't hesitate to send me a message and we'll figure out a way to get you a zine.
*4 YEARS LATER* I have ups and downs with how I feel about this zine. It’s been over four years of evolving and growing that makes me feel very embarrassed about the writing compiled in this zine. There have been many times when I’ve hovered over the “Delete Listing” button on Etsy, but every time I contemplate this, I get a new message from someone who says my writing made them laugh and scream and cry and feel not alone and see everything differently. They remind me that just because I feel that I am past that particular revelatory identity-forming stage of my life does not mean that there aren’t others who need to keep hearing the thoughts and emotions that poured out of me so necessarily 4 years ago. In summary, this writing was crucial to my sanity and existence in 2012, but it is now 2016. It no longer feels all-encompassingly representative of the politics of my identity, but I deeply understand it’s significance for some people who have not yet heard or articulated the things I wrote about. I intend to distribute this zine as long as there are people who need it. At the same time, I am thinking about a second zine titled “Not Straight Not White.. Boy Though?”

INTRO NOTE:
“I wrote this zine because there is a lack of media that I can really, truly relate to. It is glaringly obvious that this radical scene is comprised mostly of heteros, of whites, and of males. I am Asian, I am hella gay, and I am female.
Disclaimer: I wrote this for me a lot more than I wrote it for you. There is a lack of solution offering, and at the same time a lot rambling, because it is cathartic for me. It is highly anecdotal; I write from experience. Don’t assume that my aim is to educate ignorant fucks. It is not my job to cry and bleed so that they can fucking evolve.
Always for the greater gay,
xROSIx”

10603,Vintage 60's Guitar Strap Bobby Lee Ace style Hootenanny Woven Pattern Hippie Mint Condition,"
            Vintage 60's Guitar Strap Bobby Lee Ace style Hootenanny Woven Pattern Hippie Mint Condition
If you were a guitar player in a band and wanted the real deal you bought either a Gibson, Fender or Martin brand. And the same went with the guitar strap. It was either a Bobby Lee or Ace brand.
Here is an original 60's Bobby Lee/Ace style in the iconic woven hootenanny pattern. The design highlights the colors orange, brown, and white on a black background. Black leather tab ends with a black pleather backing. The leather ends are in great condition. No peg stretch on the holes. Buckle in great shape. This collectible is in beautiful mint condition.
Something about the newer remakes that don't add up. Kinda like the remakes of iconic pieces of mid-century furniture. Plastic buckles and odd shaped leather ends? I don't think so.
I can only imagine what this strap has seen in it's lifetime.

The overall condition of the camera is good for its age.

PROVIDING THE CORRECT RING SIZE IS VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ
Providing the Correct Ring Size:
When placing your order, please make sure you provide the correct ring size. If you do not know your ring size, or want to double check, it is advisable to visit a local jeweler. Many jewelers will measure your finger for free. 
Tips for accurate measurement:
• Measure your finger in warm temperatures at the end of the day (this is when your finger is at its largest).
• Avoid measuring cold fingers (cold fingers are smaller than warm fingers).
• If your knuckle is much larger than the base of your finger, make sure and measure both the base of your finger as well as your knuckle and select a size between the two to allow enough room to comfortably slip over your knuckle.
• For wide rings (more than 6mm), select one size larger than what your actual ring size is.
Please note that your primary hand’s ring size can be a half to a full size larger.
Please do not use any printable sizers that can be found online. Most of these are inaccurate.

            This artist's book is handmade, digitally printed artwork which would make a wonderful gift.   It features work inspired by and referencing Joseph Cornell's assemblage work, of which he was a pioneer during the 1930's in New York.  He was self taught, and a deeply poetic man, collecting ephemera and curating them to narrate the world around him, and the world within.  His younger brother died young of cerebral palsy and Joseph had deep love for him, having been his carer. He was interested in the surreal artists, and influenced heavily in his life by Christian Science, and I have referenced this in the book.  He also was a great believer in beauty, and believed that artists renew and transform materials, experiences, and ideas, and this belief fueled his ability to communicate the beauty and magic in ordinary, often forgotten things. 
 Enclosed in the book is a postcard I have designed and written a message to Joseph Cornell which goes some way to explaining his influence on me.
  
As each book is individually made , the cover may be slightly different to the one pictured, but will be just as beautiful!  If you have any preferences or special requirements for dedications, please contact me, and I will try to satisfy them!
Every book I make is researched and completed by myself , reflecting my interests in history, art, literature, philosophy and nature.  
The leaves are digitally printed on heavyweight double coated watercolour paper ( 190g.s.m Bockingford) for excellent print quality and longevity.

11494,"BABY BOOK, GIRL Baby Memory Book. ""She is my Joy"". Baby animals, elephants and giraffes.   Photo book for Baby.  Baby's monthly progress","
            SHE IS OUR JOY, Baby Girl Memory Book, Elephants and Giraffes.
Exceptionally high quality handmade baby memory book. 
BOOK COVER
This particular book has a beautiful creamy yellow embossed flower binding.  A soft feminine pink, with a slight luster, completes the book. A soft yellow grosgrain closure ribbon matches the accent ribbons of soft yellow and an adorable safari animal print grosgrain ribbon.   The charm window uses coordinating papers and the charm is a precious giraffe.   The quotation reads, ""She is my joy and hearts delight.""  
PICTURE 3 is another option, with the colors reversed.
I'd gladly personalize the book, perhaps with the baby's name and birth date.  The quote can remain or not.
The book measures 9""x12"". The papers, charms and ribbons I use are the highest quality. The book itself is made from non-warping fiber board, (not heavy duty cardboard) and I personally put the book together, including the binding and the 3-ring apparatus. Upon completion of the book it is sprayed with an archival varnish to help prevent smudges and stains.
BOOK CONTENTS
50 pages of 80# lightly flecked card stock are uniquely hand designed, lettered and illustrated, giving you all the prompts you need to remember everything. The pages are NOT computer generated. Each page is blank on the back, providing extra space to easily adhere important photos. 
Five white bags are interspersed in which to keep cards and memorabilia. Two color appropriate vellum pages are printed with 0-1 year and 1-5 years and provide the designation for photos and memories. The opening page in the baby book is a poem that will most certainly bring glad tears to your eyes upon each read.
MATCHING FRAME
The 4th picture
Complete your purchase with a frame designed to complement this baby book.  It uses the same papers and can also be personalized.  Comes in 3 different sizes.  For more details see:

WHY a BABY BOOK?
This baby book is a perfect way to record and journal your baby's first year and beyond. Everything from treasured tidbits of motherly advice to special details of your baby's birth and development can be recorded on these darling hand-written and illustrated pages. Its inclusive. Nothing has been forgotten. If it includes pages you don't wish to record, they can be easily removed, no damage to the book. Reliving these memories, later on, down the road, to this child and to their children is when the benefits are truly reaped. 
I believe I accomplished my goal with this book, a beautiful completely handmade book to cherish forever. A product that looks clean and artsy without the 'homemade edges'.

11665,"Ballads and Sonnets by Dante Gabriel Rossetti / 1882, Ellis and White, London / Last Volume of Work Published in Rossetti's Lifetime","
            ""But the song's end was all of his love; 
And well his heart was grac'd
With her smiling lips and tear-bright eyes
As his arm went round her waist.""
Dante Gabriel Rossetti was an English poet, illustrator, painter and translator. He founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848 with William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. Rossetti was later to be the main inspiration for a second generation of artists and writers influenced by the movement, most notably William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. His work also influenced the European Symbolists and was a major precursor of the Aesthetic movement.
I have uncovered here an extremely early copy of Rossetti's ""Ballads and Sonnets"". Originally published in 1881 by Ellis and White of Bond Street, London. It was the last volume to be published in Rossetti's lifetime. Here is a fourth edition from a year later by the same publishing house in 1882, the year of his death. Some of this poetry was originally buried with his wife Elizabeth Siddal; however, years after her death he exhumed her grave to recover them and went on to publish them in 1870. Ballads and Sonnets contain some of this and later works.
Rossetti's early poetry was influenced by John Keats. His later poetry was characterised by the complex interlinking of thought and feeling, especially in his sonnet sequence, The House of Life (included in this volume). Also included are the ballads Rose Mary; The White Ship and The King's Tragedy, Lyrics &c. and a number of sonnets influenced by paintings.
In good condition for an antique title and quite beautifully designed as would be expected, this is a lovely book. The pages have some tanning around the edges and are rough cut on the sides. There is a neatly inked name on an inside front plain endpaper, otherwise no other writing, marks or inscriptions. There is tanning to the endpapers and to a couple of the pages in the middle of the book, otherwise clean and tightly bound. The blue decorative endpapers have a charming floral design by Rossetti (see photos).
The dark green cloth boards have a gilt trellis and flower pattern to all sides. The boards have picked up some rubbing around the edges and in particular to the corners where there is some rubbing away of the cloth. They have picked up the odd mark, but overall remain strikingly attractive with the gilt pattern remaining very good and bright. The spine also has some rubbing and rolling to the cloth at the top and bottom, but otherwise is un-faded and again the gilt ornamentation has lasted well here. Mildly cracked hinges mean slightly wobbly boards, but this in no way affects the book block and the binding remains good and tight.
A beautiful Victorian collection, ""Ballads and Sonnets"" will be wrapped with care in tissue and ribbon.

            THIS HAT FITS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
What I think is important to mention about this hat is that the ears have first been traced on interfacing, than ironed on the chosen fabric, machine sewn together and had wire inserted in to make them malleable. This is the kind of quality rarely found in mini top hats and I am very proud of that.
My hats are 90% sewn together and not glued like most mini top hats available on the web. This is reflected in my prices. Also, my hats were designed with a moldable, SEWN IN wire brim for a perfect shape ;)
Wonder how your little bunny will look on top of your head?:
SIZE: 4 '' (10,5 cm - brim at it's widest) by 3'' high (8 cm)
LOOKS LIKE THIS size wise:

My hats are 90% sewn together and not glued like most mini top hats available on the web. This is reflected in my prices. Also, my hats were designed with a moldable, SEWN IN wire brim for a perfect shape ;) 
*All of my mini top hats come in their own hat box for safe keeping! If your hat didn`t come in a hat box, it is either too big or the weight of the box would have put the shipping too high ;)

• The ready to ship hat comes with a black elastic. If you would rather have a white elastic,please specify in buyer's notes.
• How to wear a mini top hat: the elastic headband should be worn BEHIND your head, under your hair, not under your chin (I do not recommend wearing it that way).
• Due to the handmade nature of my items, slight variations may occur.
• All my accessories are handmade from beginning to end by me in a smoke and pet-free environment.
• There may be a slight differences in the colors appearance due to a variance in computer monitors, lighting and my lack of ability to make professional product pictures.
Thank you for taking the time to view my ETSY listings! If you don`t see what you are looking for,I welcome custom orders and look forward to have the opportunity to do a custom listing made just for you!

13728,Antique Parasol Cover Net Lace White Fully Restored Excellent Condition,"
            This parasol cover was quite dingy and dirty when I found it. I gently soaked it to remove all signs of age, ironed and lightly spray starched,  and it turned out perfect! There are no stains, it's pure white. There's just a tiny 1/4"" hole in the netting near the top but it's under the top lace layer so it doesn't show. And the outer lace edging has a few holes and one 6"" section where it's frayed and weak. 
It's really hard to find these parasol covers. I guess they were so delicate not many survived.
Please note: there are no loops to attach this to the outer edge of a parasol, just the center hole.
This is 20"" from top to bottom, 40"" diameter.
Postage: I will refund if you overpay.        ",74.50,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1930s

            3 x 100g skeins of beautiful and soft luxury hand dyed yarn. Half of each skein is hand dyed with a vibrant rainbow, the other half a solid colour; jet black, stormy grey and pure undyed white. 
Available in Sock weight - 400m / DK weight 225m / Aran/Worsted weight -166m
All of my colourways are available on sock/ fingering, DK weight and Aran / Worsted. On either 100% Superwash Merino or upgrade to my  luxury merino/nylon/cashmere blend.
I offer a caking service, so if you'd like your yarn balled for just £1 each simply go to the listing and add it to your basket!
I pride myself on sourcing locally. The bare wool and all my dyes are from a British supplier. 
Washing tips: Machine wash on a delicate cycle and lay flat to dry. Hand washing is always recommended. Wash separately, or with similar colors.
All of my yarns go through a 4 stage wash treatment before shipping however it is possible that there will be a small amount of colour bleeding on the first couple of washes, this is normal and shouldn't change the colour of the yarn.
Whilst I have tried to accurately represent the colours on the listing, all skeins are unique and colour may vary slightly on different monitors.  
Don't forget to check out my other listings! If you can't see something you're looking for then please pop me a message, I can do full custom bespoke orders, just let me know what you love!

13992,"Weaving Loom Kit - Weaving frame, shed stick, yarn needle, weaving warp and yarn","
             INSTRUCTIONS to use this loom are free on my YouTube channel WEAVEWITHPAT 
Our weaving kit has been put together with much thought to ensure you get a good start on your weaving journey. 
The hardwood weaving loom frame has been designed and hand made by me and my artist partner Martin Hodge. Its construction allows for flexibility in the warp sett (the space allowance between each warp thread) - essential to obtaining an even surface in your tapestry weaving projects. 
The kit comes with everything you need to start weaving, including an exclusive selection of three optional colorways from the Marta's Yarns collection of yarns. 
For those of you new to weaving, I have developed a series of free weaving lessons for beginners at my YouTube channel weavewithpat.  
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyr9Fd6kLZ8cDUYAX24jdTQ
The kit includes:
1 x handmade Australian hardwood weaving loom frame 34.5 cm x 42 cm (13.5"" x 16.5"").
1 x timber Shed Stick (weaving sword)
2 x timber yarn needles
- Enough high quality Swedish cotton weaving warp for one weaving. (Linen warp in an oatmeal color is also available - please convo me if you prefer the linen warp). 
- Enough yarn in one of three colorways - Brights, Naturals or Tonals - to complete your first weaving.
Happy weaving!

14006,Medium * Modern Acrylic Lap Loom,"
            MODERN. FUNCTIONAL. DURABLE. 
Approximately 7.75inches wide by 12.5 inches tall
This modern acrylic lap loom is laser cut by me, from a lovely clear acrylic that is approximately 1/4 inch thick for ultimate durability. The loom was designed to be portable, but also simple and beautiful in order to better show off your weaving work! Unlike wooden looms which have a more difficult time surviving extreme hot and cold temperatures, the acrylic loom withstands temperature fluctuations, and is not susceptible to humidity like bamboo and other softwoods.
The loom fits easily into a purse or tote-bag, making it a great size to take along to work, vacation, or the coffee shop! Order it with a comb and needle as a set and you're off to creating your first piece of woven wall art. A great gift for a friend or loved one who enjoys crafts and fiber arts.
Medium:
7.75inches x 12.5inches
Other sizes:
Small: 5.75inches x 9.25inches
Large:
10inches x 15.5inches
________________________________________________________________________
These looms were designed and cut by Sonora Handmade in Phoenix, Arizona.  Loom thickness may vary slightly by mm due to processing by the laser cutter. Each loom is polished and finished. 
____________________________________________________
Customer satisfaction is my highest priority! Returns are determined on a case by case basis. All items are insured, so please contact seller immediately if your loom was damaged upon arrival.  USPS will be properly scolded for the error! : )
Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Do not bend. Store standing up when possible. Keep away from small children. 
____________________________________________________
Unless otherwise noted, looms will ship withing 1 business day. No shipping on Sundays, because USPS doesn't work that day (hey, we all need a break, right!?) Orders within the US generally take 2 - 3 days. Orders from the United States to other countries generally take 10-14 business days. If you want your awesome loom faster, please make sure to select the proper shipping time, but take note, the faster the delivery the more expensive it will be! Standard shipping is just that: standard. This means that you won't get a signature or tracking with your order. Sorry friends!        ",36.00,5.0,"Handmade Supply

14281,Greener Shades Dye,"
            Greener Shades Dyes are a safe, non-hazardous, non-chrome dye for use on wool, silk, nylon or any animal fiber, formulated without using hazardous metals. Greener Shades dyes provide the wash- and light-fastness of traditional acid dyes without using metal compounds to achieve bright, beautiful colors.
Dying is the perfect way to get just the color you want for your yarn, fabric or finished products. Some ideas include a knitted scarf in your favorite color, a quilt in rainbow shades, or a tie-died t-shirt. You can also dye wood for an exciting, colorful project. The simplicity and ease of these dyes make it perfect for both beginners and professionals.
Each 1/2 ounce jar of dye is able to dye 3 lbs. of fiber at 1% Depth of Shade which produces brilliant color. Lesser amounts and color combinations can be used to achieve many thousands of colors, tints and shades.
Available colors are:
- Amazon Green
- Amethyst Purple
- Coral Reef Aqua
- Flame Red
- Midnight Black
- River Blue
- Ruby Red
- Sunset Orange
- Sunshine Yellow
Citric acid is used as a dye fixative and is safe, easy to measure and not messy or smelly.
The color sample/instruction card has yarn samples in all nine colors on one side and instructions for both simple and detailed dying for all kinds of fibers and fabrics on the back.
Purchase options include:
- A complete starter set with all nine colors in individual 1/2 oz. jars, an 8 oz. packet of citric acid and a color sample/instruction card priced at 45.00
- A set of all nine colors in individual 1/2 oz. jars priced at 40.00
- Individual colors in 1/2 oz. jars for 5.00 each
- An instruction card with dyed yarn samples priced at 3.50
If you order more than one jar of a single color, the amounts can be combined into one jar to save on shipping. Please contact us if you would like to use this option.
We will combine packing if possible with these or any other purchased items to save shipping costs for you.        ",3.50,4.9231,"Craft type: Dyeing & batik, Leatherworking, Rug making, Sewing, Weaving & tapestry

14602,100 Random OR U-Choose! Vintage 35mm Slides,"
            I have a plethora of 35mm slides that I bought for a project, and I am looking to sell the remainder. A lot of photographs that I used were doubles or the subject was taken from slightly different angles multiple times so some of the best photos are still in the set. 
These are primarily from the 60's, 70's, and 80's but include some images from the 90's and 50's. They include travel landmarks, nature scenes, family photos (amazing vintage fashion), and so on. Unless specified, each set will be a unique mixed set of images. There are some plastic cases, though the majority are cardboard. Almost all are the standard 35mm rectangular images, but some are the large 2X2 square, 1X1 square, and smaller 16mm slides.
I can accommodate requests for particular imagery with a small additional fee, considering time spent curating the images. Please get in touch with me before or after the sale to let me know what you're looking for! I will give you as much as I have of your subject and fill in the rest with other neat pictures.
Please contact me also regarding the sale of multiple sets, as I can quote you a shipping cost.        ",7.75,5.0,"Vintage Supply from the 1960s

The Wubbers Story:
RUGGED: 
Wubbers laugh in the face of 12-gauge wire. The jaws are strong without being cumbersome. The Wubbers handles are long and feel substantial in your hand, providing leverage without feeling bulky.
VERSATILE: 
Move from heavy to fine wire with the same pair of Wubbers. You won't feel the need to switch pliers when you move from task to task.
PRECISION: 
The unique Wubbers finish holds tight without marring your metal. There is a fine line between metal jaws with a finish that is matte enough to hold tight, but also smooth enough to help prevent marring. Wubbers are the best in successfully finding that balance.
PRACTICAL: 
Wubbers consistently outperform pliers that cost twice as much.
GENTLE: 
The amazing Wubbers handles won't leave your hands feeling 20 years older. The padded grips provide extra comfort and feel nice in your hands. The smooth-action springs help prevent fatigue while the sleek shape of the handles makes them easy to grip.

            1,000 ft of thick, 100% cotton string that is great for macrame and crafts.  Size is approximately 6 mm (see photo for size comparisons).  Comes in 2.5 lb spool.
Second picture shows 3 mm next to 6 mm.
Please note, the string measurement is taken after the fiber is unwound from the spool and has a chance to breathe and expand.  The appearance of the measurement when it is tightly wound on the spool is closer to 4 mm.  Please see detail photo for relative size.
Perfect for creating macrame wall hangings with lots of fringe and intricate details.
This is the same fiber I use on my own pieces, and it's so lovely to work with.  It's soft, so it does not cause blisters and raw fingers the way that rope does.
The color is a natural ecru color -- not pure white.

OUR STORY:
We decided to start making dog chews and antler craft items after years of collecting deer and elk antlers here in Northwest Montana. All antlers are natural shed antlers,meaning that they fall off every spring and regrow through the summer. My family and I spend numerous hours searching the woods for these allusive sheds. We (myself, my wife and our three children (2 girls and one boy) love the outdoors and decided this would be a great way to reuse these sheds. All funds from the sell of these chews will go towards their college fund!! As parents, this is a way that we can help our children appreciate the outdoors and hopefully create a passion that will last a lifetime!! Thanks again for your consideration of our products. Take a look at our other listing as our inventory will change weekly.
* 100% Natural ANTLER - No Additives. 
* Will not clog up your chewing dog's digestive system like ropes, rubber, bark, rocks. 
* No Colors to stain your carpet 
* No chemicals like plastic chews, heavy starches or artificial flavors. 
* Full of natural minerals 
* No Splintering, Long Lasting- Great for Dogs that love to chew. 
* Come from Wild Deer and Elk as they naturally shed their antlers once a year. 
* All antlers are Cut and Sanded to prevent sharp points. 
* Also good for your small pets that need to gnaw on items to keep their teeth from overgrowing!! 
Or place near your squirrel feeder and watch the critters find them.
Antler Grading:
**** We try our best to describe the grade of each of our antlers. This is particularly important to determine the correct sizing for your dog. Our grades are as follows:
#1 Grade A antlers - Brown to Light brown / white with no visible cracking or other surface defects - Longer lasting and greater life chew; perfect for an aggressive chewer or puppy! 
#2 Grade A antlers - White with visible hairline cracking - Great for elderly dogs or dogs that get bored easily; horn slightly softer and easier to break down. 
#3 Grade antlers - White chalky - not suitable for chews! 
Disclaimer:
* All chews have the potential to be a choking hazard. As with any chew, supervision is always advised. If your pet has any issues with these chews or any other chew, take away and discard immediately. 
* Antler chews and other hard chews have been known to cause tooth fractures. If your pet is elderly or has sensitive teeth, we suggest using the #2 grade antler (these are slightly softer due to laying in the sun longer). 
* Once the chew has become small from excessive chewing, discard remaining chew to reduce risk of choking. This is true of all chews (whether rawhide, plastic or antler). 
Shipping: 
We ship out every day! These will all be shipped out with flat rate boxes / envelopes from our local USPS store. We try our best to ship these as quickly as we can and pass along the actual shipping cost (unlike others that reduce the price of their chews, but increase the price of their shipping). We are happy to combine shipping, so please wait to make final payment until we send out your final invoice.        ",18.75,5.0,"Handmade Supply

15540,Brebeuf Lighthouse.Stained Glass Pattern.Lighthouse download.Digital stained glass.Downloadable file.,"
            This listing is for a DIGITAL PATTERN only featuring the stained glass panel named in the title of this listing. This pattern is intended for intermediate glass artisans. There are 81 pieces in this pattern. The final project measures 19.5 X 10.5 inches before framing.
WHAT YOU GET: When you download this pattern, you will receive at least 3 files. Two will be pattern files in “PDF” format ready to print. One file will print on standard letter size paper and is for reference. The other will be a full size to scale pattern. You will also receive a colour “JPG” format file of the finished stained glass project.  
HOW TO GET THE PATTERN: The pattern will be available as an instant downloadable PDF as soon as your payment has been processed. Look for the link on your purchase receipt. A link will also be sent to your Etsy e-mail address within moments following your purchase.
You can also find the downloads in our Etsy Purchases section. There will be a link called, “Files Ready to Download” next to your order/transaction information.
This purchase is non-refundable. You are buying a digital pattern – not a finished product or kit. These are electronic PDF and JPG files that you have to print out yourself. 
You will need to print 2 full sized patterns; one to use as a master for fitting and the other to cut apart and trace onto your glass choices. I am generally providing the design only but some patterns have additional detail. If the pattern is not already numbered, you will need to number each piece correspondingly on both patterns. If grain lines are not on the pattern, I would also recommend that you draw these lines on the individual pieces prior to cutting so that all glass runs in the same direction according to the design. For example, distant hills or trees should be vertical and sky and water pieces should be horizontal.
PATTERN DISCLAIMER: Please note that the pattern files and finished project photo file may differ slightly. I have chosen to modify most patterns after production of the finished project  for the following reasons: either to make it easier, enhance the design or reduce the number of required pieces. Changes are minor in nature though and should not prevent  you from using the photo as your guide in glass and colour selection.
This pattern is for PERSONAL USE ONLY; it may not be sold. I hold copyrights to all my patterns. However, you may sell finished projects that you create from my patterns.

WHAT YOU NEED: You will require a PDF reader program to view and use PDF files. I recommend ADOBE ACROBAT READER. This small program may be downloaded from ADOBE.COM. You can also search online for “download Adobe Acrobat Reader”. You may also use this link (accurate as of Jan 2017): http://get.adobe.com/reader
COLOUR DISCLAIMER: Due to limitations and differences in device displays, colours shown may not accurately represent the actual product. Photographic images are intended as a guide only.

            An excellent and inexpensive way to add to your glass collection!  You will get a variety of colored and clear patterns and textures. The variety pack could include opals, iridescent, clears, cathedrals, textures, baroque, wispies, and more.  Excellent for panels, garden art, mosaics, windows, and whatever else that creative mind of yours comes up with!
PLEASE NOTE: Actual glass received will differ from the glass in pic. The colors/textures will depend on what I have at the moment but I try to make a nice mix so you can have variety. Sorry but we cannot honor requests for certain colors/textures.  Each piece measures approx. 4"" x 6"". A couple of pieces may measure just a little larger or a little smaller.  
The Nature of Art Glass: Unlike common window glass, which is perfectly smooth and flawless, art glass seeks visual character through aesthetic ""imperfections."" These characteristics mimic the hand-made sheet glass of centuries past. They come in the form of textural waves and striations, random seeds (air bubbles) and a variety of other natural effects. Art glass achieves its personality through these peculiarities, and no two sheets are ever identical.        ",35.99,5.0,"Materials:  glass, stained glass, art glass

            Dandy Wagner's home cheesery from Wisconsin.     I doubt the rennet tablets are still good.  Two have been removed, but the unit has never been used. Kit has everything but the recipes, but you can get cheese making recipes on the Internet.  The press, compression screw, discs, sleeve and thermometer are all new condition.  Box is a little dented and dog eared from storage.  Has been in witness protection in my elderly neighbor's basement since she received it as a Christmas gift in 1973 or so.  Great decor or use it to make cheese!  Novel thought.  Summer project for the kids!  Christmas gifts in the making!
 YES we ship International. Convo for Canadian, International or combined shipping. Item ships USPS Priority Mail or UPS whichever is most economical for client.
  History: This is from an elderly neighbor who is ""thinning out so her children don't have to deal with things."" Her home is a veritable treasure trove! Check all the other listings, and we add new every day. 75 years of ""stuff"".

            I'm sorry, but this ring has sold on a payment plan for 8199.00 and to be sized to a 6 free of charge (additional sizes up will be 150.00 flat rate) on 2/25/17. Check back weekly for newly added Jewelry Finds!
A rare retired museum quality ruby and diamond ring made by no other than 'Tiffany & Co.' for the ultimate collector or gem connoisseur! This ring was made sometime in the 1990's and all ruby pieces were put to a halt in production in 2003 by Tiffany so this piece is HIGHLY collectible and absolutely gorgeous. It might be the most beautiful ruby I have ever laid my eyes on personally. Please watch the YouTube video over and over- very true to the color and flash and quality! This ring comprises a cut corner square step cut ruby set in an 18k yellow gold basket mounting, flanked by two cut corner square step cut diamonds, in individual platinum, four-prong basket mountings, on a knife-edge shank which measures from 1.55mm to 2.12mm wide. The ruby is eye clean, color: R90, displays 50% brilliance, measures approximately 5.74mm x 5.39mm x 4.24mm, and weighs approximately 1.21 carats. The two extraordinary diamonds have the quality grade range of E-F color, VS1 in clarity. One measures approximately 3.68mm x 3.68mm x 2.21mm, and weighs approximately .24 carats. One measures approximately 3.71mm x 3.71mm x 2.23mm, and weighs approximately .25 carats. This outstanding and sensational retired and rare 'Tiffany & Co' ring has an approximate total diamond and gemstone weight being 1.70ct t.w.. The ring is stamped “TIFFANY & CO. PT950 750 T&CO. 950.” and it's personalized serial number. This ring weighs a solid 4.1 grams, measures 5.5mm North to South, 12.33mm East to West, and is raised 5.50mm off the finger. This ring is a petite finger size 3 so PLEASE check the measurements and refer to my photos. It is not a small ring in stature, just a small finger size :). My trusted jeweler can safely re-size this for an additional 150.00 please inquire as it's a very rare piece and I want to communicate as much as possible on this ring's sizing. I would say it can go up to a 7 just to be safe and to protect the hallmarks. Just message me anytime for questions! A current certified retail replacement appraisal will be emailed upon request once the sale has been completed, please inquire. It appraised independently for over 11,000.00 wow! And Tiffany will NEVER make another ring like this, it will hold and gain in value, so acquire this today! Questions are welcomed on Ring-1838.

            Handwriting from a note, card or document engraved on a gold ring - these make the best gifts!  Personalize your new stacking ring with a handwritten sweet note from your husband or child.  Worn alone or stacked with others, whatever memory you want to commemorate or person you'd like to honor....you can't go wrong with these - they are the best everyday rings! You can even wear your ring in the shower without harming it!  I never take mine off!
Our rings are NOT plated - they are gold filled which has an actual layer of solid gold-pressure bonded to another metal. Gold filled literally has 100% more gold than gold plating. Gold filled is much more valuable and tarnish resistant. It does not flake off, rub off or turn colors like plated rings. With care, TMB gold filled jewelry will last a lifetime, plated jewelry will not last long. 
You will not be disappointed in the quality of your TMB ring - promise!  
this RING includes: - 
- 3/16"" rose gold filled ring 
- all rings available in sterling silver, rose gold filled and 14K gold filled  
We do not used prefabricated manufactured rings. Instead, we hand forge the metal ourselves and weld/solder the seam in our studio. TMB rings are made by hand from start to finish. Due to the handmade nature of our rings, the seam might be somewhat visible. Although we aim for perfection, we rather not polish away the gold and instead opt to embrace the handmade character of our rings- we hope you do, too!

I I -MORE INFORMATION-I I 
✥ Gold filled is an actual layer of gold-pressure bonded to another metal. Gold filled is not to be confused with gold plating as filled literally has 100% more gold than gold plating. Gold filled is much more valuable and tarnish resistant. It does not flake off, rub off or turn colors.  Avoid exposing your jewelry to perfumes and household chemicals such as when cleaning with bleach or ammonia (or when swimming in chlorinated water) as these chemicals can permanently damage gold filled jewelry. To clean your gold filled jewelry, simply use dish soap and hot water or a jewelry polishing cloth.
Gold Filled Rings:  Exposure to lotions, high humidity levels, and individual body chemistry can sometimes cause gold rings to leave your finger temporarily green. This is not a defect and can even happen with solid gold rings. The discoloration typically is harmless and washes right off with soap and water. To prevent your ring from turning your finger green, take care to keep perfumes, lotions (especially Victoria's Secret!) and other chemicals away. Remove your rings before swimming, especially in saltwater. With the proper care, you can enjoy wearing gold filled jewelry for many many years.

17540,Vintage 1920/1930s Miriam Haskell Style Carved Mother of Pearl Shell  Faux Pearl Silk Cord Necklace,"
            This vintage late 1920s/early 1930s necklace features carved Mother of Pearl shell and faux pearls sewn on  silk cord with a mother of pearl button at the end.  The necklace is not marked, but is similar in style to early Miriam Haskell jewelry.  It measures approximately 14 1/4"" in length by 18"" in width.  
According to Cathy Gordon & Sheila Pamfiloff's book, Miriam Haskell Jewelry, 2004, specifically with regard to identifying early pieces, ""Some of the earliest necklaces and bracelets, circa the late 1920s-early 1930s, had the beads, leaves and other decorative elements mounted on silk cord, either as a single strand or sewn together to create a wider underlying structure.  The cord was sewn into a loop, and a bead, pearl, shell, or element continuing the design theme completed the jewelry closure by being passed through the loop.  In other instances, the cords were left long, sometimes with decorative elements on the ends, and the wearer tied the cords at the desired length.""  
The silk cord is dirty and the mother of pearl button is loose.  This piece is in great condition and is a wonderful treasure to add to any collection.
Thank you for viewing my offerings!        ",125.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1940s

""When I look up at the night sky and I know that, yes - we are part of this universe, we are in this universe. But, perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up - many people feel small, because they are small and the universe is big - but, I feel big! Because my atoms came from those stars. There's a level of connectivity. That's really what you want in life, you want to feel connected, you want to feel relevant, you want to feel like a participant in the goings on of activities and events around you. That's precisely what we are... just by being alive."" - Neil DeGrasse Tyson

The Process:
Electroforming is the process of slowly building a layer of metal on a non conductive surface using electroplating techniques. An object is painted with an conductive paint, placed in an electroforming solution and then hooked up to an electrical rectifier. Slowly a layer of metal builds up. It can take between 12-32 hours.

The Health Benefits of Copper
Modern science confirms what people around the world have known for hundreds of years. Copper is an essential nutrient, playing a vital role in keeping bones, skin, brain, blood vessels and immune system strong and healthy. Copper also has anti-bacterial properties useful in slowing the spread of illnesses. Because copper can be absorbed through the skin, wearing copper jewelry has become a simple, popular way to reap the benefits of this lovely metal. Although modern science has not provided specific evidence of the health benefits of copper jewelry, many still swear by it, and copper jewelry remains in high demand.

            Inspirational Leather Bracelet - Braided Leather Bracelet - Stamped Silver Quote Word Band - Snap Closure - Leather Cuff - Leather Bracelets
These leather braided bracelets for teens, men or women, feature inspirational quotes on a rustic silver word band adhered with sterling silver jump rings.  Each leather bracelet measures 8 1/2 inches long and features a snap closure for easy wear. Please note that these bracelets are a loose fit and do move around your wrist as you wear them. If you are looking for a snug, tight fit, this is not going to be a fit you enjoy. I do not offer an adjustable fit or custom size. 
You can choose the color of your bracelet. Color options are shown in the last picture. From left to right: Dark Blue, Brown, Orange, Dark Brown, Rustic Brown, Tan, Khaki, Black.  *Please note that due to lighting and the coloring of the leather itself, color shades may vary in person.*
Each silver word band has been pre-stamped and is in all lower case letters.  Please choose from one of the following quotes.  I've included what phrase each quote matches in the drop down option of your order:
1) the journey awakens the soul (the journey awakens)
2) life is about creating yourself (creating yourself) 
3) reality has limits, imagination is boundless (reality has limits)
4) dream as if you'll live forever (dream)
5) embrace imperfection (embrace imperfection)
6) enjoy the journey (enjoy the journey)
7) possibility begins with imagination (possibility begins)
8)live in the moment (live in the moment)
9) live the life you've imagined (live the life)
10) capture life's moments (capture moments)
11) know in your heart you are loved (you are loved)
12) encourage your hopes not your fears (encourage your hope)
**I cannot offer any other quotes, other than what is pictured at this time.**
When you place your order, please make sure you've chosen the color you desire and the quote you want.  Failure to do so, may include a delay in processing.  
**Please note that I cannot guarantee the fit of the bracelet as these are not adjustable.  I've measured these on two different sized wrists and they have fit.  My wrist measures 6 inches and the bracelet does not fall off but it is a loose fit. Please send me a convo if you have any concerns about the bracelet not fitting and we can discuss further.**

18573,Mad Max Fury Road Tom Hardy Paracord Survival Bracelet,"
            Mad Max Fury Road paracord bracelet. Same exact style and color worn by Tom Hardy in the new Mad Max film. These are also the same style and color bracelets Tom Hardy wears on a daily basis outside of filming. If you seen pictures of Tom Hardy, you'll see he's wearing the same style bracelets as these. You won't find any others as accurate as mine. These are made with the correct color and accurate to every detail including the correct tail length and cord ends. Others who offer these make them with extremely long cord tails and if you compare pictures of Tom Hardy's bracelet you will see this is incorrect. These are adjustable bracelets with about an inch of adjustment and once over your wrist you pull to tighten or you can leave it loose.
Bracelet is made of 550 Paracord in Foliage Green (Please note some photos from the movie also make the bracelet appear tan, this is incorrect. What you see is the sand from the desert covering the bracelet. Also promo photos have filtering making the color look different than it really is. See collage photo of Hardy wearing his bracelet in the film and in normal lighting conditions.)
These will be made to order based on the size of your wrist.

To measure, wrap around a flexible measuring tape around your wrist as seen in the photo. Make sure when you measure you don't measure skin tight. Tape measure should move freely on your wrist but don't add any extra length to your measurement. I make these slightly larger to compensate for the thickness the weave adds to the cord and to fit over your hand, so if you add length to your measurement your bracelet will be too large. If you don't have a flexible measuring tape you can use string and wrap it around your wrist the same way, make a mark of your measurement then lay it flat and measure with a ruler.
(Please note depending on the size of your hand the bracelet might be snug going over your hand but once on your wrist it will be loose and then you can adjust as you wish.)
Please leave your wrist measurement in the notes section if it's not listed as an option when you place your order.        ",13.50,5.0,"Handmade item

18930,Womens vintage 1960s grey suede lace up Mod shoes by Elliott Caterpillar • 60s Mod,"
            Elliott Caterpillar grey suede mod shoes. It says size 9M on the lining.
Lace up shoes with metal rings and suede covered cord laces, edged with metal toggles.
See photos for measurements with tape measure.
Across the vamp - 5.5""
The shoes measure approx 10"" inside length which I think equates to a UK 7 or 7 1/2. 
The size on the inside say 9M which is a vintage sizing.
Good condition, the inside of laces have become open to reveal the brown cord, they have been worn and used frequently but mostly are pretty good and definitely still wearable. 
The heels and body of the shoe are in great condition. The lining label sticker has shifted a bit but that doesn't affect the shoe in anyway.        ",51.74,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1960s

perfect if your going for that Bombshell sex kitten look! ;)
Perfect for that Glam Couture by the pool at VIVA, VLV.
Label: ALIX of Miami
size : Medium (vintage, pleasecheck measurements)
excerpt from the Vintage Fashion Guild....
Alix of Miami was one of the many manufacturing businesses that sprang up in Miami, Florida in the mid 20th century. In the post-World War II period, the city of Miami, Florida became a leader in the development of “modern” mid 20th Century design. The city’s location lent itself to modernism with a twist of tropical.
Alix of Miami made beautiful cocktail and dinner dresses with a tropical edge. They also made glamorous swimsuits, which were often studded with rhinestones.
Not much is known about the company. Two of the important figures in the business were Alix Schneidman and Luther V. Powell, who later worked at Serbin, another Miami clothing manufacturer. We believe the company was open from the early 1950s into the 1960s.

19793,Hooved Shoes | Faun Shoes | Size 6-9 US | 37-40EU | Black and White | Pony Boots,"
            Important:
When you order your shoes just add a remark and let me know if you want the short or the long boots (black or white) and which colour you want for the hooves (black or white). 
FAQ:
Is it difficult to walk in those shoes?
It´s pretty easy to walk in them, even when it looks uncomfortable. The shape of the hooves makes it possible to roll over (similar from heel to toes), that makes it easy to hold the balance. A rubber sole prevent that you slide away.   
How long will it take till I receive my hooved shoes?
It takes about 4 weeks till your hooved shoes are finished. The main reason why it takes so long is, that the shoes I need are coming from a special shop in australia and the shipping takes a while. The National Shipping (Germany) takes about 2-3 days. Worldwide shipping takes (depends on where you live) 1-2 weeks.
Which colors are possible?
You can get black or white hooves. The shoes are available in black and white.

19813,Felt grey winter boots Felted woolen shoes Boho snow valenki Wool painting bullfinch titmouse Felt birds Warm soft footwear Rubber sole,"
            Felt shoes Women winter boots Valenki Snow woolen boots Needle felting Felted bird Wool painting
These felted boots (unisex) or valenki* are made of natural sheep’s wool. I use only organic products and stuffs in my work: pure organic wool, warm water and soap. The process of felting the shoes continue over two weeks. At first, I felt many layer of wool till they are hard and tight. That is why the woolen shoes perfectly keep their shape but also let your feet skin breathe.
Valenki are perfect in light snow and harsh frost. They accumulate the warmth particularly in the area of sole.
The rubber soles are made of thermoelastolayer. That is why the foots don’t slide and don’t rip during the frost. The soles are water-resistant. Your feet won't get cold even in minus 30 C degrees.
The felted wool is a thermal and breathable material, maintaining the perfect temperature any time of year. Felt is a perfect material for footwear. It is extremely wear proof and warm. When you put them on, you won't want to take the shoes off, because they are cozy, soft and comfortable inside. They will definitely make a part of your winter outfit.
These shoes are decorated with the prettiest winter birds – bullfinch and titmouse. For creating the birds, I used barbed needle, multicolor merino wool and my phantasy. This technique called needle felting or wool painting: a barbed needle felt together wool fibers onto a flat wool felt surface.

""Valenki are traditional Russian winter footwear, essentially felt boots: the name valenok literally means ""made by felting"". Valenki are made of wool felt. Valenki were once the footwear of choice for many Russians, but in the second half of the 20th century they lost most of their appeal in cities, due to their association with rustic dress. Valenki are a kind of traditional Russian footwear which is usually worn for walking on dry snow when the weather is frosty"".        ",350.00,5.0,"Handmade item

19844,"My Lucky Shrooming Bag For Mushroom Hunters. Tough tear resistant scuba mesh, solid bottom","
            I am an avid Morel Mushroom Hunter.   I can honestly say that - this bag is the most comfortable & practical mushroom hunting bag on the market!
   This is a 15 x 17 inch mushroom hunting bag made out of tough tear resistant mesh used by scuba divers around sharp reefs.   It has a thick very comfortable adjustable strap that you can adjust into a handle or over the shoulder bag.  We also added the solid bottom to protect the morels or any other wild mushrooms from crushing as the bag gets filled.  The mesh we use is thicker with smaller holes which also protects your mushrooms from grating, while still spreads the spores as you walk through the woods. 
   
   It is proudly made in the USA.   I have been working with this company for a while to perfect them, just got them in right at the peak of my mushroom hunting season.  Took a few bags for a test run..   I am very very happy with how they turned out!     I was even lucky enough to fill it up under 2 elm trees.
  Another awesome feature about this bag is I wore it over my head & shoulder .. as I was picking morels,  the bag was right in front of my chest to put the mushrooms in, which freed up both of my hands for picking.  And as I moved through the woods at a decent speed the bag hangs just a bit higher which allows me to move fast without smacking the bag around with my legs with precious morel mushrooms.
  The bag comes with a 8 inch pocket that reads ""My Lucky Shrooming Bag"".  You can fold the bag & the strap into the pocket for off season storage.
 We are very proud of this design, hope you enjoy it as well.
 The mesh is needed when you pick morel mushrooms to release the spores so they plant else where, start a new mycelium growth & will keep producing mushrooms in the same as well as new areas.  Using a mesh bag also keeps your mushrooms fresh.  Plastic bags suffocates the mushrooms where they start the spoiling process and onion/ grapefruit bags are not designed for delicate spongy morel mushrooms so they end up grating the morels.
   The mesh is very sturdy.  We use high quality mesh material so you don't have to  worry about ripping your mushroom bag with precious morel mushrooms in it.
 I run through the woods from spot to spot due to season being so short & don't want to worry about  ripping one of these bags when they snag on the lims.  
    Unique and thoughtful gift.
   We are in love with mushroom hunting & look forward to spring every year to harvest the elusive morel mushrooms.  We travel from state to state picking them to prolong our season, covering up to 12 states.
  Morel Mushrooms Etsy Shop has been born out of pure desire and dedication to giving our fellow mushroom hunters & nature lovers products to show off and wear proudly!   We are a very small, family owned outdoor gear company and would greatly appreciate you telling your nature loving friends and family about us.

Instructions are included to create the perfect size for you with a favorite loose fitting tee shirt. No funky stitches, if you can do a dc and can read a pattern, you can do this!
Hanging sweater was made in a Red Heart Cream. I don't recommend this, it turned out VERY stiff. 
Pictured on our adorable model is ""I love this yarn"". It has a chunkier drape, and gives the sweater more of a boho look. 
Suggested yarn is Caron Simply Soft, as it gives the piece an amazing fluidity and soft drape. Photos coming soon.

20135,Brown Leather Bag // Large Leather Tote // Soft Leather Bag,"
            Perfect everyday leather tote in a beautiful distressed saddle brown color.
This leather tote was inspired by my father-in-law's leatherwork from the 70s, which often featured a mix of complimentary earthtone browns and contrast topstitching.  The design is simple, yet elegant, to showcase the beauty of the raw materials.  The tote is soft, casual, and unstructured.  
// Approximate Dimensions //
 - 13"" high x 16.5"" wide x 4"" deep
 - 9"" Strap Drop
 - Slip Pocket = 8"" wide x 6.5"" high
 - Unlined
 - Full grain leather**
 - Saddle-grade Vegetable Tanned Straps
 - Solid Brass Key Ring
*Need an Extra Pocket on the other side? No problem:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/462828316/
*Need a structured, flat bottom for your bag? Add this option:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/479063919/
The tote features beautifully distressed, Italian full-grain, full-aniline saddle brown leather**.  This leather is sort of like your favorite pair of worn-in jeans - perfectly imperfect, with color and texture variations throughout.  The full-grain leather may or may not have healed scars, scratches, etc.  The straps are made of saddle-grade American vegetable tanned bridle leather and are strong, yet supple, and cured with waxes to help them stand up to the elements. The straps are top stitched for strength and beauty, as well as burnished for comfort and to seal the leather. The tote is unlined and has one interior slip pocket for your phone and keys. 
**Leather is a natural material, and I only use full grain leather, which is authentic and is considered the finest grade, as it has not been sanded down and resurfaced during the tanning process. This means that the leather may have natural markings, wrinkles, scars, small blemishes, etc., which are considered ""signature"" of fine leather, and become part of the rustic, distressed texture of this bag.  Every hide comes from a unique cow, and as such, there may be variations in color and texture both within a bag and between bags, and no two totes will be exactly alike - leaving you with a bag that is uniquely yours!

20431,Hand stitched leather belt,"
            Bespoke leather belt made on demand.
I stitch my belts by hand using the traditional saddler's stitch. The tools (Blanchard) and the linen thread (""Fil au Chinois"") I use are the very same than those used by the famous leathercrafters on the market.
 
This belt is made of 3 layers of full grain vegetable tanned leather. The middle layer gives this raised effect. This model is 1 1/4 inch (32 mm) wide, thickness is 4 mm on the edges and 6 mm between the lines of stitches which are made of a single thread on each side. Several colours combinations are possible for inside/outside layers and thread colour.        ",83.28,5.0,"Handmade item
