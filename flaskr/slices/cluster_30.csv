            Articulated Clown, Pierrot, Marionette Puppet French Vintage. Circa 1925
Now a confession, I have researched this puppet for several hours to no avail. When I bought it I was told it dates from the 1920's. I have absolutely no doubt that the design dates from this period, however, I do have some doubt as to if its an original or a reproduction.
Regardless it is a lovely well made item, the image is paper which has been put on wood. 
I have taken a photograph of the back so any buyer can decide if its an original or a reproduction.
It is quite large being approx 13 inches tall and all the joints move freely. To make it move one pulls the string.

            Dr Seuss Quote Leather Luggage Tag, Oh The Places Youll Go Hot Air Balloon Genuine Leather Graduation Gift, WanderLust Travel Gift
Precision cut from the highest quality thick harness leather, Exsect genuine leather luggage tags are sturdy, durable and designed to last for decades. 
2"" X 3.5"" hand dyed genuine leather luggage tags
Leather finish is SUNBURST (shown in images). Sunburst leather stain is exclusive to Exsect Inc. Ive been perfecting the technique since 2008!
All tags come with Super PREMIUM butter soft deerskin (not cheap suede) lace ties. Cut from North American whitetail deer hides, this premium lace is lightweight and has some stretch, but is extremely strong. 
**Personalization can not be added to these luggage tags.
***The design of this tag can not be altered. Additionally, the font or quote can not be changed.
****The grain side (back side of the leather) can not be tooled or embossed.***
(As seen in image 5)
You can see any embossing or tooling impression on the back permanently imprinted onto the front. It looks terrible and makes both sides illegible.
The backs of the tags are prepared so you can write on them with any Sharpie marker! Sharpie is permanent on these tags with no need for sealant. If you do want to seal your written address, phone number or name etc. on the back, I would highly suggest Krylon's Clear Matte Finish spray paint which can be found at any Walmart, Home Depot or Michael's.
Exsect Inc. leather luggage tags are novelty pieces. Tags do not have address card pockets nor am I able to hand write information or inscriptions on the back. All information for decorating the back of your luggage tags has been included above as well as decoration ideas and examples provided in the listing images.

2059,Large Floor Vase Studio Pottery Signed Bill Shillalies Ceramic Artist Dark Blue & Brown Camel Color Hand Thrown Wheel Thrown Pottery HUGE,"
            Huge floor vase, signed by ceramic artist, Bill Shillalies. Blue and brown tone colors, bulbous shaped, quite large, and very heavy!
It's an older piece of his beautiful hand thrown studio pottery, made on a potter's wheel. 
The color at the top begins a lightly speckled blue, which then slowly graduates into a midnight (dark) blue, before merging softly into a copper color brown (a.k.a. 'camel' brown or rust color). 
The bottom is inscribed ""Bill Shillalies"" (with a cross above it). 
It is finished with a light clear coat on the exterior.
Dimensions: 14.5"" inches high x approx. 13"" diameter. 
The top hole opening measures 3-1/8"" inches diameter, while the base diameter is 3.25"".
This has been in our home for the past 9 years, but our style of decor has changed. It is a beautiful piece of pottery for that one show piece or focal point you've been looking for (it looks great on a high ledge, too!)
 
It is in mint condition with no chips, cracks, or hairlines. The exterior is nice and clean. I'm sure there's a little dust on the inside, otherwise it's extremely well-made, and excellent quality.
 
PLEASE NOTE: VASE WEIGHS OVER 13 LBS BEFORE packing. IT WILL BE PACKED VERY WELL, WITH CARE, AND DOUBLE-BOXED.
Shipping cost is due to the heavy weight and DIMENSIONAL size of package, so please take costs into consideration -- especially the further you live from PA. ESTIMATED PACKED WEIGHT IS 20 LBS. There will be at least 3"" inches of cushion added to all six sides as well, which will create a huge box!

2321,Vintage Victorian Micromosaic Bracelet with Flowers from 19th Century and Made in Italy,"
            Vintage Victorian micromosaic bracelet in gold-tone with flowers from the early 19th Century.  This bracelet is made in Italy and is marked as such. Beautiful inlaid floral mosaic made up of tiny pieces of shaped glass.
Fantastic condition: Minimal visible aging or wear
Measurements:  Approx 7.5 inches long and 5/8 inch wide. Should fit most standard wrist sizes.
History: The term 'micromosaic' was given to this type of jewelry in reference to the Roman mosaics that were famously made of tesserae, or little glass bricks. Sold as fine Victorian jewelry to women in the early and mid 19th century, these pieces became popular when the tourism trade flourished in Rome.

5028,Antique Imari Plate,"
            This listing is for an antique Imari-ware plate made about 120-130 years ago.  It is hand-painted and the overglaze is slightly raised, thus giving the plate a slight texture when you run your finger over it.  It is decorated with cranes, matsu pine and blossoms, and it has a Kinrande textile pattern. 
 
Kinrande refers to extravagantly decorated gold painted porcelain.  Patterns include cobalt blue underglaze with red and gold overglazes.  Originally Kinrande porcelain was produced for export, as the domestic market preferred more simple porcelain-ware.  Fine tableware and high-shouldered jars with gold brocade designs began to enjoy popularity in Japan by the end of the late Edo period after a decline in the first half of the 18th century.  
Imari-ware refers to pottery produced in Okawachiyama Village in Imari town. It is roughly divided into four different types: Iro-Nabeshima, Nabeshima-Sometsuke, Nabeshima-Seiji, and Nabeshima/Koimari. Iro-Nabeshima is characterized by red, yellow and green designs painted on a pure white or blue and white background. Nabeshima-Sometsuke uses indigo blue paint on a white base, Nabeshima-Seiji is pale green or blue-green coloured pottery, and Nabeshima/Koimari is the name given to porcelain produced in the kilns of the Nabeshima clan. Koimari refers to porcelain produced during the Edo and Meiji Periods.

            Rare antique French black silk top hat gibus with a gilded stamp 
Late 1800s 
This collapsible hat (called chapeau claque in France) is held open by springs and with a gentle push, folds flat to be stored 
The hat is of a shiny black silk, which feels very soft and tactile
The hat is fully lined in black silk with a gilded stamp representing a shield with a lion, unicorn, with a crown and a C monogram
It reads ""chapellerie nouvelle HUC famille"" with the adress of the shopmaker in Pezenas
The borders of the hat are well curved

Please see pictures for the details
The opening system still works well with the springs
Sizes of the opera hat: 6 inches high (15cm), approx. 21.2 inches around the interior band (53cm)
Great for display and also still ready for use

Much prettier in reality than on the pictures, believe me

The childrens table top is 24 inches square, and the table height is 20 inches. 
Our childrens chair dimensions include a seat height of 12 inches and a seat width of 10 inches.
At www.JasonVarleyDesigns.com, we specialize in kids furniture, and child safety is our top concern. To ensure this, we mill all the wood used for the legs of our small furniture. This enables us to provide thicker (1 7/8""-2""), stronger legs on all of our childrens and toddler table sets. At www.JasonVarleyDesigns.com, we feel this adds to the quality and the lifespan of our kids handmade products.
This wooden table and chair set is beautifully stained and finished with a clear coat for protection and durability, making our kids handmade furniture ideal for use as nursery furniture, playroom furniture, preschool furniture, or childrens bedroom furniture.
Table set includes 2 chairs, each with armrest.

7943,"36"" Large Rustic Wall Clock","
            This Large Rustic Clock is a great addition to any home decor. The clock has been handmade using rough cut lumber from some back wood mills near the foothills of the Adirondacks. Each clock is hand crafted and finished using a distressing technique that gives it a reclaimed, barn wood look. 
This clock has an approximate diameter of 36"" and the clock face is about 1"" from the wall when hung.  It has a quiet high torque clock mechanism / movement. It does come in three pieces and requires some light assembly. I am guessing under 10 min for most people. All you need is a phillips screw driver or screw gun. Doing this saves a bunch of money on shipping. 
This is a stock photo, the actual clock will be slightly different due to the sanding and grain patterns of the wood. The hands will be those in the image with the white background. We had too many issues with the hands with the open ends as they were cheaper hands and were not balanced correctly. 
I have many other round and square clocks in my Etsy store ranging from 18"" to 42"".  Clocks can be personalized as well.  If you have any questions please ask.
If you wish to personalize the clock please choose the personalization option and put what you want it to say in the note to seller section. Note personalized clocks are non-refundable.

9039,Psoriasis Eczema Intensive Therapy Skin Cream - Burdock Root,"
            Intensive therapy cream 
This cream is amazing.  A pea size lasts all day with fabulous results.
The ingredients in my products are pure without fillers or being water downed.   Most in the market lotions have a high water intake.  My products contain ingredients in their pure raw form.  This product was, for me, a life saver.  All of the ingredients have been chosen to eliminate the scales of lesions as well as moisturizing them as well.  I was shocked at how well this product worked.
My latest reviews:
                                      ""Both my son and I suffer from psoriasis. We have been using this cream for about a week and it is really making a difference in the thickness and scaliness of our skin. Thanks.""
 
                                       ""Psoriasis Eczema Intensive Therapy Skin Cream - Burdock Root""
5 out of 5 stars     
Amazing product. Thank you so much!
This large 4 ounce jar will last a long time due to the rich nature of the product.
The photos depicted is my experience with this cream for a particularly psoriatic lesion.  With twice daily application of this cream, this lesion healed and disappeared.
I use this product on my at risk areas each morning after a shower while my skin is still damp and again at night before I go to bed.  This cream is so rich, that each area should only require a pea size application.  While it may feel a bit greasy at first, the rich plant oils and plant butters absorb quickly providing you with lasting hydration and protection.   The photos are my actual lesions before and after.
I know the challenges of psoriasis.  Having suffered with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis for decades, the disease was illusive to any non-prescription products.  After enduring round after round of chemo, and, the unfortunate side affects of the drugs, I knew that I had to develop suitable cleansing and skin care products.  I have made an all-natural intensive skin therapy cream for years which has been vital to reducing my flare ups as well as those suffered by many of my customers.  Most moisturizing soaps and creams for psoriasis and eczema contained tar, artificial fragrances and filler that actually worsened my condition.  I could not tolerate shampoos made with tar or that contained artificial fragrances.  
The search for natural remedies was extensive until I developed a combination of known herbal remedies.    This product was created to help eliminate the scales, sores, inflammation and itching associated with skin lesions associated with psoriasis and eczema. My skin became involved to the point that it  I was embarrassed.  I began using this product 2x per day and on a morning and nightly basis.  My lesions have reduced by about 90% and those did not clear within 2 weeks reduced in size.   It has been a Godsend for me.  I have been making this product for years and people rave about the changes they made in their skin.
This listing is for a large 4 oz jar.   It takes only a pea size amount of product for a local area.  This cream is very dense and each jar should last for several months at the recommended usage. Deep rich natural emollients with wonderful exfoliating ingredients to penetrate the build up and scales of the diseases.
This dense quality cream includes burdock root, aloe vera, soy, olive and jojoba oils, shea butter, bees wax, honey, cocoanut oil, aloe Vera, honey, witch hazel and essential oils which hydrate, soften and reduce the scaling lesions of psoriasis and eczema as well as a propriety combination of natural plant extracts and emollients.   It does not include any animal byproducts or petroleum products.
Please see my youtube.com video for additional information.  User:  Marrs Mercantile relating to application and benefits of this skin care product.

Full base size (from pole end to pole end) is 56""
Inside base size is 48""
Center fabric height is 56""
Teepee height is 5' when set up for play
Poles are 6 feet long, and are solid wood poles, they are NOT flimsy dowel poles.  They also have drilled holes so the lacing can be threaded through the holes for a more stable teepee.  NO RUBBER BANDS!!   This is one of my most popular teepees sold in boutiques around the country, now being introduced on Etsy since it has become so popular in my other retail settings!  It contains no metal components or chemicially treated/colored embellishments.  All 100% cotton canvas and premium wooden poles.   It is made to last through years of imaginative play.  
The natural canvas and white canvas teepees will have tie backs.  The colored canvas teepees do not have ties.
All seams are turned under and professionally finished so it looks just as good inside as it does outside.  Perfect for the beach, the park, as a photo prop, or as a fun and functional conversation piece in your favorite room or play room.  The  poles are smoothly sanded and left unfinished for a modern look.
These teepees can definitely be used outside!  They are made to last through years of imaginative play.  Please remember to bring the teepee inside during inclement or windy weather, and overnight.  
Sturdy, eco friendly cotton twill tape ties the poles together.

All of my teepees are shipped via USPS Priority Mail in a specially made teepee box.  Guaranteed safe delivery within 2-3 days of shipment.
Your canvas teepee can be machine washed, but please remember that canvas loses it's stability (stiffness) when it is machine washed.  If you machine wash it, you should lay it flat to dry.  Spot washing is best if you love the thickness and great look of canvas.  Complete washing instructions will be provided with your purchase.

14014,Kuretake metallic gold brush pen #60,"
            The Kuretake #61 brush pen, made in Japan, has a flexible, broad brush tip loaded with metallic gold ink. (Note: as you can see in the sample photo, the ink is more of a metallic ochre than a bright gold.) It's easy to go from thick to thin strokes quickly, which makes this pen excellent for calligraphy and drawing. The ink dries to a satin finish, and you can make the strokes more opaque by going back over them with a light touch. Try it on dark paper for a stronger contrast.

Hi there!
My ""Begintermediate"" Guide to Hand Lettering Workbook got a whole new face lift! I am so excited about it.
Hand Lettering is everywhere these days! It adds an organic flair to just about anything from wedding envelopes to your kids student council poster ;)
I've taught hundreds of people to learn the art of hand lettering, and you can totally learn too!
This workbook and guide is all my hard earned tips, tricks, letter drills, and examples to help guide you, teach you, and inspire you!
You may have dabbled in some sort of calligrahy before, or never picked up a brush pen in your life. This workbook is great for levels varying from just starting out, to an early intermediate letterer. It's hard to put each person in a beginner OR intermediate group... which is how ""Begintermediate"" was born! Those lines are blurry, and now there's a guide to take you from the beginning, pushing you to create beautiful letter forms AND awesome letter connections and an early intermediate level! :) 
Included in the workbook:
hand lettering terms and rules
warm up practice drills and why we do them
my simple hand lettering style of alphabet with specific instruction on how to draw each letter
practice drills to help you master your new pen, and my style of lettering
intro to letter connections
letter connection practice drill
intro to composition and how to improve yours!
The book is printed on high quality super smooth 70lb paper, and spiral bound.
Tracing paper is included in your kit to help extend the life of your workbook, and to give you some ""instant gratification"" when learning hand lettering. (Trace over my letters!)
NOW for a LIMITED TIME each Kit comes with one of my new soon-to-be-released 2017 PRINTS! 
This can be purchased WITH or WITHOUT a pen and pencil. Please choose which option you'd like in the drop down menu. 
WORKBOOK  PEN OPTION -- 22.50
workbook  Kit  WITH A TOMBOW FUDENOSUKE PEN  PENCIL so you can start right away! It literally has everything you need to not only be artistically inspired, but jump right in and learn! :)
 Please add which pen you'd prefer in ""notes to seller"" Hard OR soft nib. If you don't do this, or want me to choose, I will put in whichever pen I think best. Both are amazing for beginners to pros, you really can't go wrong!
YOU CAN ADD AN EXTRA PEN. Just go to the ""add a pen"" listing and add it to your cart. 
JUST WORKBOOK-- 17.50
The Intro to Hand Lettering spiral bound workbook sold separately without a brush pen or pencil. 
The Intro to Handlettering Workbook  Kit goes PERFECTLY with my Intervanced Hand Lettering Workbook! ;)
This is such excellent value for the price. Just be warned! Hand lettering is addicting! 
For personal use only! Please be honest and do not replicate for any reason. 
I love to send this as gifts! Just message me and I'd be happy to gift wrap an item and send to the recipient directly for you :)

Description:
Camera bags that are designed and used by a professional photographer! Porteen Gear bags have been field tested and are now carried by over 9000 photographers worldwide and rapidly counting, with 100% positive reviews.
The bag body is made of water repellent waxed canvas that ages beautifully the more is gets scuffed and used. I see this fabric used in Australia on hats and dusters. I love the rugged look and durability of this material! 
GENERAL INFO:
All Porteen Gear bags are padded on all sides with foam and the inserts can move around to accommodate a bigger camera or move out of the way to make this a bag with one big compartment. All seams are triple stitched. Strap is adjustable for shoulder or cross over.
I have also included a free zippered pouch to hold your currency, passport or camera cards. This makes it easy to only carry one bag when on an outing.
SMALL: 
Bag measurements: 8 inches (20.5cm) long by 4 inches (10.25 cm) wide and 8 ½ inches (22 cm) tall.
The small camera bag is really designed for the bigger DSLRs with lens attached. It make a great camera cover and has extra heavy foam padding and is only one open compartment.
COMPACT MIRROR-LESS
Bag measurements: 10 inches (25.4cm) long by 4.5 inches (11.43 cm) wide and 7inches (17.78 cm) tall.
The Compact Camera Bag is designed for the mirrorless camera systems, this lightweight bag has three compartments like our medium sized bags. The bottom has 1/2 inch foam padding and the outer shell is a compressed harder foam. You can also carry a DSLR (without battery grip) in here with a lens attached.
MEDIUM: 
Bag measurements: 12 inches (31cm) long by 6 inches (15 1/2 cm) wide and 8 ½ inches (22 cm) tall.
The medium is designed to hold a full size DSLR camera and two lenses. I made it tall enough to carry my 70-200 tall lens. It is also good for a day trip with one extra lens and a flash. There is a heavy-duty zippered pocket on the front and a velcro pocket on the inside back. There are also 3 easy access pockets on the front to hold lens caps and a pen for that all-important model release. There is a full sized Canon 5D Pro camera body attached to the lens nestled in the middle pocket of the bag in the photo.
MEDIUM-LONG: 
Bag measurements: 13.5 inches long by 6 inches (15 1/2 cm) wide and 8 ½ inches (22 cm) tall.
The medium is designed to hold a full size DSLR camera and 2-3 lenses. I made it tall enough to carry my 70-200 tall lens. It is also good for a day trip with one extra lens and a flash. There is a heavy-duty zippered pocket on the front and a velcro pocket on the inside back. There are also 3 easy access pockets on the front to hold lens caps and a pen for that all-important model release. 
LARGE:
Bag measurements (interior): 13.5 inches long by 7 inches wide and 10 inches tall.
The large bag is designed to hold a full size DSLR camera and 2-4 lenses. This is a great bag for DSLRs with battery grips or photographers with many lenses. The large bag features a shorter carry handle and a foam padded shoulder guard for comfort.        ",130.00,4.9308,"Handmade item

15348,Glamorous Gold Metallic Edible Paint by Sweet Sticks,"
            Just SHAKE, POUR & PAINT! 
NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHOCOLATE OR CHOCOLATE COATED CAKE POPS!
Edible Art 'Metallics' Decorative Paint by Sweet Sticks is a range of revolutionary paints made in Australia. With a unique blend of 100% edible ingredients they can paint, dry and be rub free on many surfaces making cake decorating quicker, easier and more effective. 
Our paints take away the need to mix lustre and alcohol together that makes one big mess most of the time and money. Simply shake, pour & paint. 
- Fondant
- Buttercream cakes (chilled)
- Sugar cookies
- Marshmallows
- Confectionary
- Ganache
- Modelling chocolate
- Macarons
- Fruit ie: Berries
Our edible metallic paints can be applied a number of ways but we recommend good quality brushes (sable brushes work amazingly) and long brush strokes. 
The paint is ready to use from the bottle, so there is no need to thin it out or mix it with any other ingredients. Once applied and dried the pigment is sealed within the surface - no dust or smudges! 
Shake well before and during use. 
Keep away from children and store in a dry cool place. 
Bottle is 15ml.
GETTING STARTED TIPS & TRICKS 
SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE!
There's a whole lot of lustre in that bottle!
If paint is transparent, keep shaking
If you need to add more paint to your palette, shake beforehand
Brushes are important, take the time and find a brush that suits you and the paint
Long brush strokes show amazing results
We find lying the bottles flat in between use allows the lustre to blend quicker
Our paint dries rub free so it's worth the wait in dry time. No more white gloves!
If these paints are new to you, take the time and have a play. Don't compare them to other products on the market because there isn't anything like it. Have fun with them. 
WHY YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT...
Paints on fondant
Paints on chilled buttercream
Paints on macarons
Paints on heaps of other things too! Dries in one hour or less
Itâ€™s actually rub free! No fuss!

            Picking up a number of small round beads can be as frustrating as herding cats! Use these little triangles herd those beads into place. It will save you time, frustration and beads!.
A clever way to organize beads while you work. Pick up, sort, and pour beads. The triangle shape & angled edges allow you use these trays as clever little bead scoops to chase down errant beads. Sort your beads into different trays while you are working. When ready to put your beads away, pour them directly from any corner into small bags, tubes, or compartments. 
Very durable. I have the same set I have been using for over 20 years. I have tried it all and this is the very best solution that solves all kinds of bead herding troubles.
So lightweight I use them as tray on bead weighing scales. These trays nest, so they are easy to pack along for beading on the go. Bright aluminum lets you see your beads clearly.

Hand stamping is a unique craft where each letter is stamped one letter at a time. Letters may not always line up perfectly and this is not meant to take away from the quality of the piece but is meant to add to its charm. No two pieces will ever look the same.
Care Instructions:
Silver plated jewelry should be cleaned periodically. To extend the life of your jewelry, it’s very important that you keep it dry (never bathe or spray perfume on your jewelry, chemical reactions with chlorine and other elements such as perspiration can lead to tarnishing).
Remove jewelry when sleeping, exercising, or doing physical activities, as prolonged contact with sweat will cause the plating to wear away faster. Never use abrasives chemicals or products to clean your jewelry. After each wear, gently wipe each piece of jewelry clean of make up and skin oils with a soft, lint-free cloth in order to avoid scratching.
The round discs are made with Aluminum. There is a much lower rate of skin reaction with aluminum than with sterling silver. It will never tarnish, discolor or rust. It does not leave green marks on your skin like other metals. Aluminum is a metal that is easy to maintain. It polishes to a nice shine with a polishing cloth.
**All personalized jewelry is final sale.

________________________________________________________________________________
Here are some more fabulous hints on making sure your new beads stay in beautiful condition; so remember the following care tips:
*When not wearing your beads, we recommend that you store them in an airtight bag. *Try to store your jewelry separately so it doesn't scratch other jewelry. Plastic bags are wonderful for protecting jewelry pieces. *Jewelry should only be put on after washing and applying any makeup, hair spray, gels, lotions or perfume. *Try to protect any jewelry from harsh chemicals, extreme temperatures and sunlight. *Always try to store your beaded necklaces or bracelets flat. *You should not wear beaded jewelry while doing household or outdoor chores. *You should never wear any jewelry when swimming or showering. The chlorine can cause damage. Please do not swim or shower with your beads. *Wipe with a damp cloth and if need be a little mild dish soap, but do not immerse. *Store your jewelry in a clean, dry place. *Jewelry should never be dipped or used in an ultrasonic cleaner. *Avoid dropping and hard contact (i.e., knocking against objects). *Put on jewelry last when dressing and take off first when undressing.

            Bohemian back body jewelry, Bridal body chain designed to be worn across the back in a vest style, Gypsy body jewelry, Handmade Lotus pendant back chain necklace, Boho-chic, Festival accessory.
Fiorella by the Elf dictionary means: Little flower. This beautiful gold body chain is part of my new collection inspired by fantasy creatures. 
I believe that every woman on her wedding day is a goddess and i designed this body jewelry exactly for this feeling.
Fiorella body harness is the perfect way to upgrade your outfit easly and give it a bold bohemian statement. for every day t-shirt, under or over cropped tops, for a nightout sexy back dress, bikinis, festivals & raves and for your special day it's an elegant boho back necklace for the boho/hippie/gypsy bride in you:)
Fiorella body chain jewelry is 100% handmade and crafted by me.
you can choose the metal you prefer: 925 sterling silver or silver/gold plated chains (nickel free).
I use 2 types of chains on Fiorella body jewelry to create an intersting pattern, I craft by hand a beautiful Lutos which seets at the center of the back and adore it with labradorite and swarovski tiny gems.
At the side of body are draping of chains ending with labradoride beads and feather charms. 
The body jewelry is lightwieght and easy to wear, just like a vest.
I highly recommend to hang it on hanger with your clothes, this way the strands won't get twisted at all. 
Fiorella body chain in the pictures is a size small-medium. I encourage you to include either measurements or a dress size with your order. My interest is in providing you with the best product possible. If no measurements are provided then the product shipped will be as seen on this listing.
