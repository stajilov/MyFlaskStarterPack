16,Tin toy English banker's box,"
            I found this pixie-sized metal box in Philadelphia.  It's an adorable toy version of an English Banker's box or document box; complete with the same signature paint colors and striping.  There is some obvious paint loss, but the gold paint is especially vibrant even after all these years.
The box measures just 3 inches long, 2 inches wide and is 1.5 inches tall (with lid on) and 1 inch deep.  The latch is most definitely challenged.  It doesn't want to remain closed, but it does look like with the proper skeleton key, the mechanism would work.
The carrying handle is intact and moves nicely.  There is rust on the bottom of the piece and the paint loss I already mentioned.  It is marked ""English Make"" on the back.
It's a lovely collectible and would look sweet in a vignette.  It's definiely a unique, hard to find piece.
Note **** the doll is simply a display piece and NOT included with the box.        ",30.00,4.9333,"Vintage item from the 1920s

            You are my Sunshine Maxaloones! 
This listing is for one pair of Maxaloones in your choice of size!
Maxaloones are seriously fun pants made in a ""grow with me"" style so you get maximum wear in addition to maximum cuteness! The waist band and leg cuffs fold up or down depending on the sizing needs of your kiddo and adjust as he/she grows. They're perfect for babywearing and cloth diapering. The design has extra room in the bum for those cloth diapers and the versitiliy of the legs allows you to keep those tootsies covered while baby wearing by rolling the legs down on chilly nights! 
This listing features a You are my Sunshine print in soft cotton lycra, with coordinating 
light turquoise leg & waist bands with same bum circle. (bum circle is the backside of the pants, shown in the 1st photo :D ) All seams are completed using a serger and topstitching with a double needle coverstitch.
Sizing - these are a one size fits most and sizing is approximate. 
Squishiloones - Newborn to 3/6 months
Miniloones - 3 months to 12 months
Size 1 - Maxaloones - 6 months to 3 years
Size 2 - Monster Maxaloones - 1 year to 5 years
Silly Sea Turtle is an authorized seamstress and seller of Maxaloones, using an original pattern written by Max and Meena.
All Maxaloones are made in my smoke free and pet free home, with love and attention to detail. All fabrics are prewashed and preshrunk before making them into super cute pants. Most often i use All free and Clear detergent with a snuggle fabric softener sheet in the dryer. Since the fabrics are preshrunk you don't need to worry about them shrinking on you in the wash. In our home i wash our maxaloones on cold, and tumble dry on low. 
These maxaloones are ready to ship and will ship within 48 hours of payment. If your order contains other made to order items, it will ship within approximately 3 weeks (but i always try to be sooner than that) Shipping is a flat rate of 5 regardless of the number of items you buy! Is your order going to be 75 or more? Use coupon code SHIPITFREE and shipping is on me! 
(for my international friends, spend 75 or more and receive a 5 discount on your order. WORLDWIDEFRIEND. And if you are overcharged on shipping, i will always refund the overages! International shipping is also flat rate regardless of the number of items you buy! )
Please contact me with any questions - i am happy to work with you!

1712,Matching Pair of Retro Green Egg Swivel Chairs - Mid Century funky 70s  - Very Good Condition Retro 60s Danish Industrila Influence,"
            Matching Pair of Retro Industrial Vinyl Swivel Chairs - Up to set of 8 chairs
Lovely opportunity to own a stunning pair of original 70s Industiral swivel chairs. These are an original item from the 70s and think were used as hairdressers or barbers and are made from a shiny english racing green vinyl with metal base. They have a very nice retro style and egg shape which gives them a funky mid century look. They are not height adjustable but are on swivel metal base which is good comercial type quality.  The chairs are heavy weight and feel to be made very well but ive not seen any chairs like these before or have a brand on the. These chairs would make a strong statement in a retro themed home or bar as they are part of a set of 8.
These pair of chairs come in very good original condition for the age and show minimal wear to the upholstery. The Cushion foam and vinyl still has years in it and will last a long time if looked after. There are no rips, tears or major scuffs to the fabric on any of these chairs. The  chairs have had a light clean and there are no pulls or rips and the quilting part is still in very good condition. 
 
Overall the condition of these chairs are a high 7 out of 10 and although not new they are a very clean example of a well looked after peice of vintage furniture with no signs of heavy use.
 
I would be happy to sell separate but there are 8 of these chairs avalible and happy to do a discount to take all the chairs.
 
I feel that the buy it now price reflects the and super condition of this item and is cheaper then the others that I have seen sell for over Â£250 per chair on ebay.

            As of 09-16-2016 we don't have any of the golden brass rivets left,and they are now arriving in a red brass color as in the current #1 photo here in the listing. I just re-took the photo. If our vintage supplier ever gets anymore of the golden brass,I will buy all they get in even if it's 70 gross and more.
These rivets are U.S. made nickel-free raw brass and are 3/32"" wide,5/32""long and the head is 11/64"" across.  You will receive 1/2 gross or 72 pcs. with one listing.Now you can decide if you want to rivet your pieces together or solder them if both methods are doable for you. If your pieces are not drilled,you can always drill or punch the holes with your jewelry tools or regular tools.
You will receive 72pcs. or 1/2 gross with one listing. ***WE HAVE A 10.00 MINIMUM SHOP PURCHASE OF SUPPLIES WHICH SHOULD NOT INCLUDE THE SHIPPING CHARGES. WE THANK YOU KINDLY IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR COOPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING.***        ",4.00,4.9961,"Vintage Supply from the 1970s

3506,VINTAGE LIBERTY DRESS - Handmade little girl dress in Liberty fabric from the 70's,"
            My mother made me this summer dress when I was 3 or 4 years old, in 1973 and in the same fabric, she made herself a similar version but with a hem to the floor. Hers will be posted as well.
The fabric is from Liberty of London. The color has faded a little, and it is now s soft shade of poppy red. Poppies appear in the pattern as well as other wild flowers in pinks and purple hues. There is plenty of fabric for your sewing project.
The design is simple and retro, with straps crossing in the back. The back is closed with a two pressure buttons.
The dress is in good condition with two small holes hiding alongside the bottom edge of the frill, the small one is 1/16"" in diameter, the bigger one is 1/8"" in diameter, and so close to the edge the hem could be shortened.
 
The measurements are as follow:

4435,Vintage Round Vinyl Ballet Case Suitcase Black Faux Ostrich Vinyl Outside Pink Vinyl Inside,"
            This is a wonderful vintage vinyl round ballet case with a looped handle on top and zipper closure. The case is covered in black faux ostrich vinyl on the outside and lined with pink vinyl on the inside. 
Condition:
There is a split in the vinyl on the outside at one of the seams on the bottom. There are a couple of snags in the pink vinyl on the inside. The original owner thought it would be a good idea to write her name and address on the inside in magic marker, and there it still stays today. I actually think it gives it a little character.
The case measures 12"" tall, 13"" wide and 5"" thick.
All sales are final, so please ask any questions prior to purchase and I will gladly and promptly reply. Shipping is for the continental USA only please. I'm not looking to profit on the shipping, just cover the cost and make sure the item is insured for your protection. I estimate shipping based on worst case scenario to cover costs from shipping here in MA to CA. Any shipping overage of 2 or more will promptly be refunded. If you are outside of the continental USA, please convo me for shipping quote.

            Most dogs resist wearing clothing - it seems itâs just not their way :-D  But sometimes the weather outside is frightful and your dog's poor pads are in danger of frostbite!  These neoprene dog booties are just the thing to let your pup stay outside in below freezing weather long enough to sniff out the right spot to do his or her business.
Booties are to protect the pads of your dogs feet and should only come up to the start of the front pastern and rear hock â right at where the dogâs âwristâ would start. They should fit snugly and should not come off easily when pulled at the toe. 
These booties are made to order and have a slight stretch for that snug fit â just like a scuba suit!  They also have a non-slip circle for extra gripping and a Velcro closure to keep them secure.

            This dog bed cover is made from premium upholstery-grade cotton fabric that is beautiful, durable, and machine washable. Stuff it with one of our premium eco-friendly dog bed inserts (sold separately at 
www.etsy.com/listing/489777824),
 an old dog bed, or your own linens or pillows. Each cover is handmade with care in San Francisco.
D E S C R I P T I O N
Our versatile pet bed duvet covers are crafted with an envelope closure on the bottom, which means that there aren't any zippers or buttons for your dog to chew or pull. And, they are sewn using heavy-duty thread and overstitched for durability.
The Ticking Stripe cover features a classic black ticking stripe on a tan background that will complement most homes. The fabric is a heavy-duty 10 oz weight and is one of our most durable covers.
I N S E R T S
This listing is for the cover only.
NEW - we are thrilled to offer premium dog bed inserts stuffed with ecofriendly fiberfill made from recycled plastic bottles, specially formulated to maximize comfort and durability. You can purchase a coordinating insert here: 
www.etsy.com/listing/489777824.
Alternatively, you can easily fill your dog bed cover with pillows (see below for recommendations for each cover size) or old towels, sheets and comforters. This is a great option to easily upcycle old linens, and we've heard that it's especially popular for pets with anxiety issues because they find your scent calming.
S I Z E S
For a perfect fit, we recommend that you measure your pet while it is lying down in its normal sleeping position and then add 10 inches to determine the optimal bed length (the longest dimension). See the size guide in the listing photos for a reference by weight.
XS: 19"" x 25"". Fits one standard pillow.
S: 20"" x 30."" Fits one queen size pillow or a size S Foggy Dog insert
M: 25"" x 35."" Fits two standard pillows or a size M Foggy Dog insert.
L: 30"" x 40."" Fits two king size pillows or a size L Foggy Dog insert.
XL: 33"" x 45"". Fits three king size pillows or a size XL Foggy Dog insert.
XXL: 40"" x 50"". Fits a folded comforter.
Using an existing dog bed inside and need a custom size? We can make almost any size in a rectangular, round, or oval cover. We can also make box-style covers with side panels for memory foam inserts. Just send me a convo and we'll figure out the perfect cover for your needs.
C A R E
Care is easy. Simply machine wash in cold water and tumble dry low.

8114,Forged Steel Night Light with amber mica shade,"
            These are made from steel bar riveted at the joints. Shade is amber mica. Dimensions are approximately 4"" tall and 3"" wide and protrude from wall 2"". These look really elegant in a bathroom or kitchen where a standard one would be an eyesore. The glow these put off at night is amazing. 
These have a natural iron patina finished with beeswax.
The actual fixture is a standard 120v C7 night light that you find in the stores. They have an automatic switch that turns them off during the day but i must say, it requires quite a bit of light to get them to shut off.
Switch plate is not included.
Please visit my policies page for more info.
Care: most of my items are natural steel finish that has been treated with bees wax. Over time the wax will get rubbed off from use and will expose the bare steel. Once a year it is recommended that you rub the items down with a light coating of paste wax to protect the steel from rust and to keep them looking great.        ",30.00,4.9856,"Handmade item

            Decorate any door or wall with this adorable monogram door hanger. The letters are hand painted with quality acrylic paint and sealed to protect the paint. This letter is hand painted in a bright teal and white quatrefoil pattern and completed with a natural burlap bow and hung with Jute rope. Item can be made with or without burlap bow. Add this Initial door hanger to your front door, bedroom dÃ©cor, office door, gallery wall or anywhere you can think of to add a splash of color and style.  Great gift idea too!
Each letter is approximately 13in. height, 9 1/2 in. width and 1/4inch thickness. 
The letters are made up of MPI Wood or MDF, medium density fiber board which is engineered wood made from small wood fibers that are pressed together to make a dense composite. The letters are great for interior and exterior dÃ©cor. 
Custom orders are welcome within reason so if you would like different color paint or a different flower color, please message me and I will be happy to work with you. 
*Each monogrammed letter is hand painted and may vary from each other and pictured. Variations are not imperfections but make your door hanger unique and special. While a protected sealant is added to your door decoration use care during extreme weather conditions to protect from rain, wind and snow.  Note: Some letters are shaped naturally heavy sided, for example J's and L's so they may not hang perfectly straight. There are ways to make these hang straight by using a 3M Command Strip (available at most retail stores) to keep in place or to attach a picture hanger to the back instead of using the rope. Most other letters hang perfectly straight.

| HOW IT WORKS |
1. Place your order-
Each of my listings has options for you you to choose, size, character, and color. If you don't see a character/shape (or size) option you'd like, I can write up a custom listing just for you! The same applies if you'd like to order more than one item, as you'd receive a discounted price/piece.
2. Choose your photos-
The number of photos I recommend varies based on the size of piece you'd like, here's a general breakdown for reference;
8""...15-20
13""...20-35
18""...30-45
*If you have more or less no worries! I would love to include your best memories in good quality, rather than trying to find extras or eliminating your favorites. It's a pretty flexible process, I can work with almost any amount!:)
3. Send your photos-
Photos can be sent through email, GoogleDrive or Dropbox to:
 Photocraftbylinds [!at] gmail.com
| RUSH ORDERS |
While I can work quickly to design, apply and seal without charging extra...I still am at the mercy of expedited USPS shipping and their costs when it comes to rush orders. At the top of my shop page, you'll see a listing for Rush Orders. Simply add it to your cart to cover the extra rush fee (25)

Buy only Root Chakra Spray: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/245100439/root-chakra-spray-root-chakra-room-spray?ref=shop_home_active_12
Root Chakra is located at the base of spine in tailbone area, this is where our sense of security lies. It is the center where we ground ourselves and take care of our basic needs. The root chakra is about your family, ancestors and cultural beliefs. It is related to our connection with prosperity and how we attract it into our life. When the root chakra is balanced, you feel grounded and have an inner sense of security. You feel supported and are able to manifest opportunities and abundance. When it is unbalanced, feelings of fear, insecurity and not feeling like you belong prevail. If your root chakra is weak, you may feel like you are unhappy with your body size or shape. You may feel as if you are out of control of your life and you canât gain control. If your root chakra is overactive, you find that you often explode angrily at the smallest things. On a physical level, elimination problems and foot issues are also associated with the root chakra.

Buy only Sacral Chakra Spray: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/245570749/sacral-chakra-spray-sacral-chakra-room?ref=shop_home_active_7
Sacral Chakra is located in the lower abdomen, about 2 inches below the navel. It is the center of  sexuality, passion, creation, vulnerability and our relationships with other people and the worldâwhich is why it is commonly referred to as the partnership chakra. The emotions, fears and strengths associated with this chakra drive your behavior. When your sacral chakra is balanced, you have energy to create a business, artwork or even children. You take risks, engage in balanced give-and-take relationships and express sensitivity or vulnerability. 
If the sacral chakra becomes unbalanced, you will have a lack of energy flow throughout the entire body.  You may feel extremely lethargic and unmotivated for life, particularly exercise and sex, leading to sadness, loneliness, and mild depression. A low energy flow through your sacral chakra will cause a lack of energy and motivation. You may feel extremely lethargic and even depressed, lacking any joyful moments in your life. If your sacral chakra is overactive, you may be feeling a constant frustration, leading to you breaking down in tears too often. You may feel like you have no personal power. Often times, you wonât be able to express emotions, create meaningful work or find the simple joys in life. 
""Creativity - Positivity - Sexuality""

Buy only Solar Plexus Chakra Spray: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/245669261/solar-plexus-chakra-spray-solar-plexus?ref=shop_home_active_5
Solar Plexus Chakra is your Power Center. It's located just above your belly button. It  is the center of motivation where we set our intentions and desires. When the power chakra is balanced, one achieves goals, is self-confident and has strong motivation and direction. It is associated with our physical center, personal power, desire, inner-strength, emotions, instincts, and âgutâ feelings.
If the solar plexus chakra becomes unbalanced, you may feel very stressed all the time and powerless to gain control, leaving you mentally and physically exhausted.   You may have âgutâ feelings but are not sure of what or where they are coming from, contributing to your distress and discomfort. If your solar plexus is imbalanced will cause you to feel powerless, especially when you are under pressure. You may often feel butterflies in your stomach, or feel as if you canât gain control over your life. If your solar plexus chakra is overactive, you will feel the uncontrollable need to control everything about your life; a âcontrol freak.â 
""Emotions - Confidence - Personal Power""

Buy only Heart Chakra Spray: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/245669493/heart-chakra-spray-heart-chakra-room?ref=shop_home_active_4
Heart Chakra is located in the region of the physical heart (center of chest). It  is the center of sympathy, empathy and love. When the heart chakra is balanced, one feels love and connection to self and others.The heart chakra is also the center of your spirit as well as the center of the chakras, making it a vital energy center for our spiritual, mental, and physical well-being. It is associated with love, compassion, safety, trust, adventure, self-compassion, forgiveness, and relationships. 
If the heart chakra becomes unbalanced, you may feel detached from the world around you.  Each breath we take that connects us to our physical and spiritual world is enveloped by the heart chakra, and if unbalanced or blocked can lead to a disconnection from the people we love, love for ourselves, and love for the earth.  Problems in relationships heighten and we tend to lose hope.  We lose sight of beauty, love, empathy, and compassion.
If you find yourself having problems in your relationships or feeling unattached to the people you love, it may indicate that your heart chakra is weak. If your heart chakra is overactive, you may find yourself becoming too attached to things, resulting in you being overly emotional all the time.
""Love - Compassion - Forgiveness""
Heart Chakra Spray: An authentic fusion of pure essential oils blended to balance the heart chakra. Essences of organic Geranium, Bergamot, & Neroli leave one feeling well-balanced.

Buy Only Throat Chakra Spray: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/245669611/throat-chakra-spray-throat-chakra-room?ref=shop_home_active_3
Throat Chakra is located at the base of the throat (neck). It is the center of Truth, self-expression and communication. When the throat chakra is balanced, one has inner trust, inner reliance and easily expresses their ideas and thoughts. Communication through thought, speech and writing.
A weak throat chakra will make you unable to speak your truth and express yourself. When your throat chakra is overactive, you often speak before you think, resulting in unnecessary arguments and hurtful words. When your throat chakra becomes unbalanced, you will find that you cannot articulate your thoughts clearly, leading to miscommunications and frustration. The throat chakra connects us to our ability to express ourselves, therefore creating a number of issues if this chakra is blocked or unbalanced, particularly from subconscious attitudes or feelings becoming trapped and unable to surface.  Severe trauma can cause this chakra to close, making it very difficult to express emotion.
""Truth - Communication - Self Expression""
Throat Chakra Spray: An authentic fusion of pure essential oils blended to balance the throat chakra. Essences of organic Lavender, Roman Chamomile, and Peppermint leave one feeling well-balanced.
Color: Turquoise Blue
Gemstones inside may include: Blue Lace Agate & Aquamarine
Third Eye Chakra (6th Chakra) - The Ajna - The Third Eye
Buy Only Third Eye Spray: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/245669767/third-eye-chakra-spray-third-eye-chakra?ref=shop_home_active_2
Third Eye Chakra is located between and just above the physical eyes, in the center of the brows. The third-eye chakra is associated with the mind, ideas, thoughts, dreams, intuition and psychic abilities. It is centred upon intuition and intellect.It is aslo the center of imagination and balance. When the intuition chakra is balanced, one feels strong intuition, a connection to oneself and mentally fit.
If the third-eye chakra becomes unbalanced, we may feel bombarded with our own thoughts, unable to process them effectively and may feel stuck in an emotional and intellectual rut.  We lose our sense of intuition, making our judgment clouded and causing us to make poor decisions.  With a blocked third-eye chakra, we become closed to new ideas and fall off the paths of our true destiny. 
If you feel you cannot visualize and organize your life very well, then your third eye chakra may be under active. If your third chakra is overactive, you may experience nightmares each night. You may begin to feel stuck and in an emotional rut, becoming closed off to new ideas. You may also feel as if your intuition is off, and you cannot trust your âgut feelings.â 
Common psychological symptoms of an unbalanced third-eye chakra: headaches and migraines, nightmares, seizures, neurological disorders, personality disorders and neuroses, learning difficulties, and hallucinations.
""Intuition - Insight - Intellect""
Third Eye Chakra Spray: An authentic fusion of pure essential oils blended to balance the intuition chakra. Essences of organic Lavender, clary sage, and marjoram leave one feeling well-balanced.

Crown Chakra is located at the very top of the head is our universal connection to beauty and spirituality. It is associated with God (or your particular belief system), spirituality, divine wisdom, enlightening, connection to the universe, imagination, awareness, and optimism. It is the center of connecting to something greater than oneself, and expressing wisdom and enlightenment. When the crown chakra is balanced, one feels strong, unclouded and joy for life.
An inability to think clearly when you are under stress means that your crown chakra is unbalanced. You may feel like you are going about life without having a specific purpose or path, leaving you feeling lost. If the crown chakra becomes unbalanced, we feel unconnected spiritually and as though we are living without any direction or purpose.  If there are many physical ailments and dis-eases that seem to continually surface without a root trigger or cause, it is likely to be an out-of-balance crown chakra, as this chakra affects the six energy systems below, and practically your entire being.  A blocked crown chakra can lead to depression and nervous system disorders and feelings of being lost and incomplete.
""Enlightenment - Higher Self - Wisdom""
Crown Chakra Spray: An authentic fusion of pure essential oils blended to balance the crown chakra. Essences of organic frankincense, myrhh, and cederwood leave one feeling well-balanced.

9651,Deluxe X-Wing Miniatures Template Tray,"
            By popular demand, I offer you this X-wing miniatures template tray with all of the most popular custom requests all rolled into one.
This is the template tray to hold a full set of maneuver templates for X-Wing Miniatures, including slots for range 1 and range 1-2 templates that are very popular with third party template makers (myself included).  Like all of my template holders, you can press down on the end of a template to easily pop it up out of the tray for use.
The deluxe tray is made of high quality baltic birch wood and has a piece of black felt on the back to protect the templates, keep them from ever sliding out through the pop-out hole, and protect whatever table or mat you are playing on.  Also included is a separate lid, similarly felt lined, and attached via strong rare-earth magnets to the template tray (which also has integral magnets).  The magnets are strong enough that you can hold the whole tray upside down with templates inside, without losing them.  Also, the magnets allow you to take the lid off during use and snap it in place underneath the main tray during use.
This has been an evolution of the very popular Highbridge template tray, and I'm very proud to offer this next iteration.  You're absolutely going to love this tray.  
As with all of my items, please feel free to contact me about customization.  Painted trays and custom laser engraving are popular add-ons.  Please note that I won't engrave copywrited logos for which I do not have the rights.  (No Star Wars logo or FFG X-Wing logo)
This tray is not a product of, or endorsed by, Fantasy Flight Games.  However, if you're not upgrading your cardboard tokens and templates when you get the chance, you're doing it wrong.  They're even specifically allowed in sanctioned X-wing tournament events.        ",30.00,4.965,"Handmade item

            The Senet, invented in ancient Egypt, is one of the oldest games known. This board game made ââof wood by hand is inspired by the Senet of Amenhotep III (fourteenth century BC) which is now on permanent display at the Brooklyn Museum in New York. A more modern reference to the game Senet is in the American show Lost where, in the sixth season, Jacob character plays a game with a Senet board located on the beach.
The game of Senet was very popular in all the social statements in Ancient Egypt. Several board games or references to Senet were found in royal tombs such as Tutankamon's tomb, Nefertari's or Amenothep's.
Some archaeologinst are also supporting the hypothesis that Egyptian people attributed to the Senet a magical or symbolic character and the game was a reference to the Book of the Dead, representing the Judgment of Osiris, the victory of the deceased and the entry into the Duat.

10818,Pokemon keyboard decal (for Asus),"
            Customizeable Pokemon themed keyboard decal, the decals come as a WHOLE SET.
Currently for Asus laptops with no number pads / key pads (as seen in the photos)
This keyboard decal consists primarily of 1st Generation Pokemon. It also contains some 2nd Generation Pokemon (mainly because of the lack of letters to correspond with the 1st Generation).
--------------------------------
These keyboard decals are customizable, so there is the opportunity to choose the Pokemon you wish to have. This will add that extra bit of personalization to it.
The customization option let's you choose if you would like the standard set to small changes (no extra charge). Larger changes that need to be made will be a small extra charge.
--------------------------
NOTE: Standard shipping does not come with a tracking number. Obtaining a tracking number for international orders is costly and rather difficult to obtain (only certain post shipping options provide shipping). Sorry for any inconvenience and concerns that occur when ordering.
==============================================
Customisation option works where ""0 to 4"" keys means you can choose either the standard set (which is the one that is picture) or choose a couple of keys to change (if you want to swap some of the pokemon / characters on some letters if you have different preferences). 
The ""5 or more"" options works the same but with a small charge (if you want a lot changed to the set).
==============================================
The decals will be created on adhesive paper and topped off with a clear protective finish.
Please do message me for any enquiries!
NOTE: If you do have any issues with the shipping address when making an order, please do message me right away after ordering the item, and let me know what the updated shipping address is (otherwise I'll end up shipping to the wrong address... no one wants that)

ABOUT OUR MAN MADE DIAMOND 
As brilliant as natural mined diamond. Our man made diamond with its one of a kind brilliance and fire,is extremely unique, and it emits every shade of light, that a natural diamond would emit. As a matter of fact, our diamond looks much better than a mined diamond because it has excellent cut, color and clarity.
Measuring an impressive 8.6-9 Mohs (the scale of mineral hardness), with only diamond measuring the maximum 10 Mohs, our stones are close to sapphire and ruby in Hardness. While being very hard, our stones still demand the same respect you would give their natural inspirations. Keep them clean and try not to knock the mountings and they will last a lifetime.

            A heart with a story to tell. Weathered, yet still strong.
This bentwood ring, made from Weathered Oak has a meaning anyone can understand. The hand carved heart symbolizes a heart that has been through a lot, but has stayed strong throughout it all.
What better way to wear your heart on your sleeve than with this timeless piece. .
At 9mm the hand crafted heart is a large enough size to get noticed, yet small enough to not get in your way during the day. The band measures 2.5mm and is rounded for a comfortable fit. This delicate looking ring is actually quite strong and can hold up to most daily use without issue.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
~DO YOU TAKE CUSTOM REQUESTS?
If you have a custom request, just send me a massage. I'll be glad to work with you so that you get the exact item you want. In fact, some of my greatest pieces in the past have been ideaâs customers have suggested.
~WHAT ABOUT ENGRAVING?
Unfortunately, Engraving is not an option as it would damage the wood finish.
~HOW DO I KNOW WHAT SIZE TO PICK?
This is a very important question. The wood rings are slightly rounded on the inside allowing for a ""comfort fit"". They tend to run about a half size larger than standard rings. So if you prefer a nice snug fit, I suggest you subtract a half size from your normal size.
~ARE THE RINGS WATERPROOF?
Yes, the acrylic finish on the rings makes them waterproof. I wear mine while washing hands, in the shower, and swimming without issue.
~WHAT DO YOU CHARGE FOR SHIPPING?
Shipping is free worldwide. When shipping outside the United States, you are responsible for any duties or taxes your country may charge.
~WHAT IS THE WARRANTY ON MY RING?
When your wood ring arrives, I hope you fall instantly in love with it. And, I hope you're glad you chose Saxon Wood Jewels to create it for you. If not, simply let me know! My goal is to make you happy. Won't fit; no problem. Clashes with your eye color; no problem. Allergic to wood; no problem. I'll make you happy, or refund your money. Period.

15753,Organic Whole Milk - Live Milk Kefir Grains - Fast growing!,"
            Live Organic Whole Milk Kefir grains ready to start making you Kefir at home!  Our grains are used daily in a non-refrigerated, organic, RAW milk environment and they are actively making Kefir - daily!  These grains ferment fast, and also grow fast.  We 100% guarantee that these grains will work very well!  After shipping, allow them a few batches, and then they will take off!  Whichever size you choose - we will ship you grains straight from one of our non-refrigerated organic raw milk active batches.  
*NOTE: Some customers have asked what type of milk these grains work best with.  These grains love whole milk!  We use them primarily in organic raw whole milk, but I have seen them successfully used in batches of store brand whole milk that is not ultra-pasteurized.  So it is your choice how you want to use them - just make sure you are using whole milk that is not ultra-pasteurized.  For daily consumption, start with 2-3 cups of milk, and then adjust accordingly based on your preference.
**SHIPPING:  Since this is a living, organic product, there may be some concerns regarding shipping and delivery time.  Our grains are extremely hardy and we have shipped them successfully across the country.  The default Shipping option is to send them out via USPS First-Class Mail.  This means that they will roughly take 1-3 days to get to your destination.  If the grains are ordered close to a weekend (Thursday, Friday, Saturday - then please account for an extra day of shipping due to no service on Sunday).  We pack our grains in containers with a bit of dried organic milk to eat on the trip, and then we put these containers into padded envelopes - so they will be fine when they get to you, but they will be hungry and need to get into milk immediately upon delivery.  If shipping duration is a concern and you need your grains faster, please send us a conversation message or select the Shipping Upgrade Option at Checkout to have them sent to you via USPS Priority Express, and we will send them via 1-day delivery service.
Select the size variation you want when checking out:  
1) We can ship you a tablespoon of live Kefir grains (straight from an active batch)
2) We can ship you a teaspoon of live Kefir grains (straight from an active batch)
One tablespoon is equal to 3 teaspoons!  We give you more than enough to get you started making Kefir right away!  Our Kefir grains are very active, and usually ferment within 8-10 hours.  They may be a little slow the first few batches you create due to the stress of shipping, but just keep them in milk and they will start cranking!  You will also notice that grains will start to grow and multiply after about 4-5 batches.  If you DO NOT want to take on a bunch of growing grains right away or want to only make a little bit of Kefir at a time, get the teaspoon size.  If they grow too fast for you, you can store them safely for up to 3 weeks in the refrigerator.  Remember - they are living!
Our Kefir grains are accustomed to Organic Raw Milk, and Organic Whole Milk, but they work great with non-organic whole milk as well.  They are used to operating in a temperature range of 68-72 degrees.  They do best in a ratio of 1 tablespoon to 2 cups of milk.  We also recommend a teaspoon to 1 cup of milk.  You can always play with the milk ratio to adjust the amount of separation you get.  They also work great for a second fermentation to get your Kefir a little extra kick.
There are 14.3 grams in one tablespoon.  We ship you Kefir grains in a 15 gram container.
There is slightly less than 4 grams in one teaspoon.  We ship you Kefir grains in a 5 gram container.        ",5.00,5.0,"Handmade Supply

Herkimer diamonds are rare double terminated quartz crystals found only in a small area of Herkimer County, New York.  A double terminated crystal has points on both ends instead of just one end. These special crystals were first discovered in the early 1800's by settlers in New York and were named Herkimer diamonds due to their diamond-like shape.

During checkout use the box: ""Note to SusanAnna,"" to list the initial and if different colors are desired please mention the desired color. Available colors are: rust, gold , turquoise, soft green moss, kelly green, black.
The brass used for these pieces does not have the thickness of a coin. These discs are light enough and thick enough in order for the pressing process to work. The pendants are thin lightweight metals.
The letters have variations because these are all made by hand. The letters are pressed and then altered with metal paints in a distressed fashion. The paint will not always be evenly laid and some pieces will have a shabby chic look. The tree pendants are organically oxidized and the sealer I use adds a delicate sheer to the brown tone oxidization distinctions.

14K Gold Filled Jewelry 
Gold Fill is a thick layer of 14k solid gold, that has been bonded with another metal, usually copper or brass. When cared for correctly, due to the thick sold gold layer, 14k gold fill, unlike gold plating, will not tarnish or discolor. Your jewelry will last as long as, & will wear exactly like solid gold.

---------------------------------
MATERIALS
GOLD-FILLED JEWELRY:
- Under normal wearing conditions and with proper care, your gold filled jewelry should last at least 10 years.
- 14kt Gold-Filled jewelry is made by bonding a solid layer of 14kt gold on top of another metal, but this layer is 1000 - 10,000 times thicker than gold plating, resulting in a durable, long-lasting product that looks gorgeous like solid gold.
- Gold-Filled jewelry can also be worn by people with sensitive skin.
STERLING SILVER:
- We use .925 Sterling Silver, which requires polishing from time to time from oxidation. You can easily restore silver back to shine with a polishing cloth or use a polishing lotion for that extra shine.

            Silver plated brass Ear Weights
A beautiful, unique and high quality piece, perfect for giving to someone special or as a gift to yourself. These hand-crafted ear weights look good on everyone and will not go unnoticed!
I hand carved these ear weights in Kathmandu, from wax, then they have been cast in brass and hand finished and polished, then plated with sterling silver, finally they are treated with a ceramic coating so the silver stays. They hang perfectly and never fall out, because they are weighted at the bottom. They look great on their own, but you can wear a few pairs together. These weights will fit holes larger than 00G, 3/8â and 10mm. I personally like to wear 2 or more weights in each hole, with a mix of brass , silver or gold.
Materials:  brass,Sterling Silver
Dimensions: 27 x 26 mm

OUR LEATHER
We take great pride in our soft, long-lasting leather hand-picked from traditional family workshops in Greece. Our natural, chemical-free leather, is the healthier material for your precious feet.   
Our leather sandals will adapt to the shape of your feet after using it a few times. The leather will become softer and more beautiful with use.

The sandals will get darker after exposure to the sun and will turn into a beautiful, rich, dark brown color. In addition, each handpicked leather hide is unique and different from all the others. It might present some unique characteristics and particularities that highlight the uniqueness of your product.

THE GREEK EVIL EYE CHARM
The evil eye or ""mati"" as it is known in Greece, has been holding a special place in Greek tradition since the ancient times. An evil eye charm protects against all evil; as a result Greek people keep the evil eye in places that are important to them such as their house, their workplace and more often their baby's crib.

18911,"Wonder Woman Boots, bootlet shoe covers. Handmade original.","
            The Original ""Bootlets""
These fit on over your own shoe to make any size shoe or heel into a boot. Made of lycra. The front sole is leather-look vinyl and there is a hole at the back to fit your own heel through. 
I invented this particular design in the 1980s when I was head designer for a clothing manufacturer. They were not meant to be for resale; only a fashion accessory for one of our photo shoots. To our surprise, when the catalog came out, we had a flood of inquiries from interested buyers about where they could buy the faux boots. Over the years I have improved upon them, taking suggestions and testing various styles and fabrics. I decided to make them in a variety of colors and styles for cosplay such as Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Batgirl, Catwoman, Sailor Moon, etc. I still make each pair myself by hand to this day. Many have tried to copy them since, but these are the original. 
One size fits most. They can be worn over most shoe sizes, heels or flats, and toe style (pointy, square, rounded). 
If you need a specific color to match your costume, please send us a message, and we can make something just for you. Color shades can vary, so piecing together your costume from several other sources is not recommended.

CUSTOM MADE:

*It is not recommended these be worn over actual boots or running shoes. The fabric is smooth and very stretchy, so any zippers, laces, thick straps or buckles will look lumpy underneath the lycra material of the bootlet. A plain shoe is the best option.

 Christmas Deadline: DECEMBER 16th is our Christmas cut off date.  Any orders placed after that date will most likely not arrive in time for Christmas 
Our tees are screen printed with high-quality ink to help prevent fading from the constant washing. We know clothes go through the ringer, so we make sure that our methods ensure a very durable and crisp print. They will not crack or peel like shirts printed with vinyl. We source from American Apparel, which have the top of the line tees. We use their tri-blend tees which give our shirts that amazingly soft feel that makes you wish you could wrap yourself in t-shirts. I've done it and its amazing ;) 
Processing time: 2 to 3 business days.
Sizing:
We find that these tees fit slightly larger. This is a unisex tee and meant to fit a little looser like a mens tee. We suggest sizing down. We've included a sizing chart in the images of this listing. 
Styling Options: For a more funky spin, try cutting off the sleeves and turn it in to one awesome muscle tank!

20711,Markiplier Ass Ass Glasses,"
            Made to order replicas of Markiplier's PAX Ass Ass Glasses.
They're pretty easy to see out of and looks like there's net over your eyes, but would probably be better used for costume than daily use. Do not get wet.
All handmade. The glasses no longer are sold with blue lenses, they will have black lenses. The pictures used to show my product are OLD PICTURES. 
The packaging doesn't change anything about the glasses, it means the packaging the glasses arrive in. The gold and silver packaging options are much stronger than the regular packaging and look so much nicer if you're sending these as gifts.
