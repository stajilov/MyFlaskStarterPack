            A vintage red and white tricycle made by the Junior Toy Division, Olney, Illinois in the 1960s. 
This AMF Trike has adjustable handlebars and seat, is 34"" front to back, and is approximately 26"" high. The pedals were modified with a piece of wood added to both sides of each petal. The front tire is 15-5/8"" in diameter and the back tires are 9-1/2"" in diameter. The handle grips are marked Hunt Wilde and the bike front has the AMF shield logo. 
The overall condition is good with wear consistent of a used trike from the 60s. Minimal rust, but in need of a cleaning. One of the rear tire's rims is slightly bent, which causes a minor wobble. Video is available to show the defect in motion.
NOTE: This item may be best suited for decorative purposes, unless you replace the rim or straighten it. We are not liable for personal injury should you decide to allow a child to use this item.
Prefer PICK UP. WE CAN DELIVER TO SOME LOCATIONS FOR A FEE. 
A shipping fee estimate is listed, which is a high guesstimate. Overage would be refunded. Ships to the lower 48 states, higher postage due for shipping to HI and AK. For economy, Greyhound will most likely be used.

979,KASHMIRI JHUMKA EARRINGS - Large Vintage Tribal JewelryDangle Earrings,"
            These vintage Kuchi jhumka dangle earrings were handcrafted during the early to mid 1900's in the Kashmir Valley located in the foothills of Himalayas. Jhumka (jhumki; jhumka) earrings are a tribal jewelry mainstay in Kashmir and in the surrounding regions.
Clattering rows of charm-tipped dangles hang from ornate Kuchi bell-shaped domes for a wonderful sound. A subtle age patina remains, adding a glow that only the passage of time can create.
About KASHMIR: Kashmir is a lush valley located in the foothills of the Himalayas. Situated halfway between the Tibetan Plateau and the diverse sub-continent of India, the Kashmir Valley has often been called ‚ÄúHeaven on Earth.‚Äù It was a central stopping place on the old Silk Road trade route between East and West, with an ancient and rich tribal heritage.

            Hello, 
Today I have a lovely old antique style storage box. 
This box is soooo lovely! 
Lovely gold wooden filigree on the top and cup handles at the sides. 
I have located some tiny holes from the old clasp on the front (see pics) 
Inside the box I have located a small hole, this is due to rot (because of age) I have treated this but the hole will remain - it's nice and solid around the hole now. 
Comes with a lovely chain inside to save damage to the lid for resting. 
Please see pictures as they are a big part of the description.

2703,Half a Dozen Vintage Map Pages n Pieces & BONUS,"
            I was so excited when I recently won a box of maps and atlases at an auction.  Inside I found all sorts of maps and atlases ranging in date from the 1960's all the way up through the 90's.  I love using map bits in my art and so I thought I'd share some with you.
You will receive 6 pages/pieces of maps - 2 large atlas pages; 2 small atlas pages and 2 pieces of fold-able maps.  The atlas pages measure approx. 8x10 & 11x14""; the fold-able map pieces measure approx. 8x9"" (two sections of a folded map).   Please note the large atlas pages will be folded in half for ease of shipping.  
Please keep in mind these are vintage, used map ""pieces"" and have been cut or torn from larger maps and/or atlases. There may be lines or writing marking out various routes; bends, folds or creases due to use or they may just be yellowed from age.  I think this only adds to the character of the map.  
Most of the maps are in color but there may be a few of the older folded maps are just black and white.  
Now, what can you do with them?  Well I love to use them in my collage and mixed media art, use them to create interesting pieces of altered jewelry, in your scrapbooks, for cards, envelopes, etc.  The uses are endless!
If you're looking for more than one set please be assured that no two sets are the same....once these are gone they are gone.   
!!BONUS!! - Recently I was lucky enough to come upon a stash of National Geographic maps.  While supplies last I will include an extra section of one of these maps with each half dozen ordered..  Supplies are limited though so be sure to order soon!        ",2.25,4.9412,"Vintage Supply from the 1960s

would look nice at the end of a bed, perhaps a boy's bedroom, if you are feeling traditional!
Women in India have saved their old sarees to make quilts for centuries, as old cloth was thought to be lucky, and/or have a protective effect, especially if the sarees or lungi used to make them had happy memories attached to them. Clothes worn on days where something unlucky happened are never used, and often burned.
 The quilts are made with 3-5 five layers of vintage100% cotton saree's, pierced and stitched together with thousands and thousands of tiny stitches. Each one is special, and each is one of a kind. They may show signs of wear, or have little patches here and there, which only adds to their quirky charm. Some may have extra embroidery, depending on the area or village where the piece was collected. size is 80' x 50' approx. may differ a little from piece to piece.

3883,Vintage 1964 Pendleton Round Up Poster,"
            This classic reproduction poster of Wallace Smith‚Äôs ‚ÄúLET ‚ÄòER BUCK‚Äù was produced in 1964 for the Pendleton Round Up rodeo in Pendleton, Oregon. The poster measures approximately 16 inches wide x 38 1/4 inches high. It has been stored in a smoke free, climate controlled warehouse.
The story behind the image is, in 1924, a young talented author and artist, Wallace Smith, asked for and received permission to gain access to the arena during the rodeo for the purpose of making sketches of bucking horses. After three busy days working in the arena and sitting on the north arena fence, he came up with his answer to the thought of creating a bucking horse that would properly symbolize the round up's slogan, ""LET 'ER BUCK"". 
This Pendleton Round Up poster is in new, never used condition and is another one of the hundreds of thousands of vintage items we have in stock.

4537,Rare 1960's Vintage Mary Kay Bonnie fashion purse kit with secret pocket on bottom,"
            I believe this was sold in the early 60s, but I can find very little information on the history of these little bags.  They were found in a box of unused Mary Kay stock from the early 60's.  There was a consultant's note with the bags that said ""tell your customers about the secret zipper pocket on the bottom"". But as you can see from the pictures, its not that secret.  it was a place for ""a handkerchief or unmentionables"" according to the notes.   This might have been a hostess gift the very first year MK sold. But that is a guess since I cant find any information on the item. The clasp and zipper are metal. The outside is a vinyl material and inside is a stretchy plastic material.   
All vintage items are sold as is.  Please look at the pictures closely.  If you have any questions, please ask!        ",10.00,4.7368,"Vintage item from the 1960s

Here comes beautiful blue eyed white blonde Sasha doll boy Gregor, a highly collectible artist doll, made by Trendon Ltd. in 1979 (or earlier) according to the original catalogue. Sasha doll boy Gregor‚Äôs clothes are original; a fine dark blue corduroy sports suit with zip & white pants & white shoes. In the photograph of the 1979 Trendon Ltd. Sasha doll catalogue Gregor also wears nice socks, he apparently lost them over time; also his neckerchief is not the one saying ‚ÄòSasha‚Äô in one corner, but very similar. Sasha doll is made of light brown vinyl, & has dense white blonde rooted hair ‚Äì it sits firm, but I am not sure if someone once gave Sasha Gregor a slight haircut; it seems to be shorter than in the original photo.
Like all the original early English Sasha dolls Gregor here is unmarked. Vintage Sasha doll Gregor measures 41 cm / 16 inches over all & is in excellent vintage condition; all elastics are firm. A piece of information for the Sasha - aficionado: The arm elastics are white, the leg & head elastics are brown.
Sasha Morgenthaler dolls are famous for their exceptional design, their quality making, great balance & dreamy expression.

5186,"Native American Basket, Apache Burden Basket, Ca 1970's, #902","
            Native American Basket
Apache Burden Basket
902. Description: Native American Basket, Apache Burden Basket, 1970's banded geometric design with tin cones. 
Dimensions: 12'' x 15'' excluding fringe 
Weight: 10 lbs.
Condition: Excellent for its age. 
-------
Basket making was one of the earliest skills developed since baskets were needed for carrying goods, for storage, for trapping and fishing, and for religious ceremonies.  Unlike pottery, baskets do not survive for extended periods of time.  Most that are available today were constructed in the last 120 years, particularly after native people in the Southwest began to make baskets with the idea of selling them and moved baskets into the category of artistic collectables.  Those made between 1880 and 1930 tend to be the most valuable, particularly if they are in good condition, well-made, and have an interesting design, but these latter factors can make any basket desirable.
One can quickly summarize baskets by type and construction, but the strongest interest has been in understanding tribal variations since different tribes used different materials, different construction styles, different quality and particularly different decorations.  As a result, the following offers some general comments on the first two issues and then seeks greater detail on tribal variation. Types Trays and bowls are the most common forms, but there are a few unusual types of baskets: Ollas ( prounced ""oy-yuh"" , a Spanish word meaning jar with a neck and mouth) This Olla shape was conducive to storing grain with less spillage. These pictures reflect variations.
     
Burden baskets are simply designed to ease the burden of a heavy load.  Many hang over the head and rest on the person‚Äôs back.  The conical shape conforms to a person‚Äôs back and evenly distributes the load‚Äôs weight.  The Apache ones add tin cones that are noisy and seem effective in scaring away snakes.  The second set of three pictured above includes two of the conical ones and an older one that narrows a bit at the top.
     
 Plaques are flat and often are used for decoration.  They are commonly made by the Hopi.
Cradle boards (seen above rt.)  are another form of basket that is used to carry a child supported against a stiff board.  The child is tightly wrapped against the board giving a sense of security and freeing the person carrying the child to do other things with her hands.  Again, decoration became more important as they became collectibles.
 
 
Water jugs were covered with pitch so the basket would hold liquids.  Carrying liquid in a coated basket makes the burden much lighter than what it would be if the liquid were carried in pottery.
CONSTRUCTION
There are a small number of basic methods for making baskets, but each option can be varied based on materials and factors like the thickness of the stitch or by varying over and under patterns.
   
The most common type of basket construction is coiling in which a larger substance called the warp is coiled in circles starting at the center.  A thinner material called the weft is stitched around the coils to hold them in place and can add decoration.  Sometimes, the thick material is actually a bundle of thin material like grass.  The coil is spiraled outward and, unless the intent is a plaque, upward. This method offers more strength and more opportunity for decoration.  Greater stability results from using a warp of multiple thick rods that are stitched together. 
 
Another common process is called twining and involves placing larger material or rods from the center outward and tying these supports together.  The thinner materials that are wrapped over and under the supports again provide decoration.  The weaver can shift the direction or use three stands instead of two or pass over two rods instead of one to vary the appearance and make a design.   Diagonal twining involves having the wefts go around two rods at a time but shifting which two on each row.  In other words, on the first row, the weft would be wrapped around rods 1 and 2, 3 and 4, etc.  On the next row, they would be wrapped around 2 and 3, then 4 and 5, etc.  A decorative element can be wrapped around the outside wefts to create an impression that is called false embroidery.
 
Plaiting requires the use of flat strips that are woven over and under each other.  Often, the strips are placed in a diagonal pattern.  Again, it is common to add variations like over one and under two.  A mixture of variations adds to the design.  This style tends to be easier than the other two and creates stronger, more rigid baskets.  Plaiting was also used to build traps, fences and the like. Wicker is similar to plaiting but uses round materials with one of the sets being thicker and adding stability to the material.  Often the thicker material is less visible or completely covered by the thinner material.
 
Wicker is similar to plaiting but uses round materials with one of the sets being thicker and adding stability to the material.  Often the thicker material is less visible or completely covered by the thinner material.
Preparing the materials for weaving often takes longer than the weaving itself.  Once appropriate materials were located, they had to be cut, cleaned, and then split or peeled since the natural material tended to be too thick for the wefts. The weaver usually needs to use her or his teeth for the splitting and peeling.  During weaving, the materials were often dampened so that the weave would get tighter as it dried.
TRIBAL CHARACTERISTICS
The most valuable baskets are those made by the Apache and Yavapai.  Both tribes traveled a lot probably making well-built baskets more important, but, in the latter part of the 1800s, the two groups were forced onto the same reservation in the desert near San Carlos.  In this unpleasant harsh life, the women had a chance to share techniques although both groups maintained their own style.  After they were allowed to return to reservations in their more traditional areas, both groups recognized that they could generate a modest income by selling their baskets and production increased.
APACHE
 
Earlier Apache baskets were usually coiled and used three rods for the warp making these baskets very sturdy and stiff.  By 1930, production of these baskets declined as children were forced into schools that did not teach basket making and older members of the tribe were pressured into other work.  The basket making skills seemed to die out for a decade and were eventually replaced by making of simpler single coil ones. Burden baskets were often twined instead of coiled with twining particularly common for the Mescalero tribe.
Apache baskets tend to use contrasting colors and geometric or pictorial designs. The traditional ones are very sturdy [because of the three coils] and the external weft is usually willow with material from devils claw seed bags for the dark color.  The willow tends to start as an off white but ages to a golden tan or light brown.  A sun-burnt willow that is darker and reddish was sometimes used for decoration. Dark red yucca root was also used for design work in rare occasions. Those baskets that added an extra color are called polychrome.
Newer baskets sometimes were twined and used a greater variety of materials including cottonwood, berry bushes, and sumac as well as willow. Dyes became more common for adding color, but the basic color is lighter than in those that have aged.
Apache designs are less symmetrical and, at times, seemed cluttered.  They frequently include figures (human, dog, deer, and snake).  Weavers suggest that it is helpful to let the basket talk to them and tell them the design rather than planning it ahead of time.  As a result, there is less consistency in weave as well as design but such variation can add interest. The use of devil‚Äôs claw has declined in modern Apache designs. (Source: Smoki museum)

5210,Tumbling Blocks Quilt,"
            This quilt, in the tumbling blocks pattern, was made in the 1890's. It is a ""scrap"" quilt of a wide variety of late Nineteenth Century cottons in cadet blue, indigo, red, black and taupe with prints of paisley, plaid, dots and vermiculate prints. This pattern has a wonderfully modern, almost cartoonish, delightful look. An understanding of geometry and color values creating depth was required to successfully use this pattern.
  The quilt is hand sewn and hand quilted. The fill is cotton and the backing is a soft pink/taupe cotton that wraps to the front of the quilt to form the  edge binding which is machine sewn. There is one 9"" x 17"" patch of red on cream paisley on the back. 
  The quilt measures 77"" x 69"". There is some ""trunk staining"" (storage discoloration) on some of the lighter blocks. It is in very good condition. There is a muslin hanging sleeve sewn on one edge. The quilt is very dynamic displayed on a wall.        ",450.00,4.9412,"Vintage item from the 1800s

            Soon to be on Wayfair  www.wayfair.com
Most dogs love to be up off the floor and love to have a bed of their own. This custom wood dog bed is made from solid wood. It is painted or stained to any color you choose. The simple headboard is easily attached and has your pup's name hand painted with paw prints painted on either side of the name. If you prefer something other than paw prints just let me know, I'm happy to customize any order.
This bed stands approximately 11 1/2"" from the floor to the top of the bed rail and 20"" in overall height with the headboard. The sizes listed are based on pillow size (pillow not included). HOWEVER, if you don't see a size listed that you want and you have a pillow bed that your dog loves, just send me the size and I will make you a custom sized bed just for your pillow. Your dog pillow will sit approximately 4 1/2"" deep into the bed.
I can customize the size of the bed to suit your needs, including smaller bun feet if necessary, please contact me before placing your order if you need a different size. Bun feet may vary depending on what we have in stock.
**When ordering, please include the color choice of your bed, pet's name and the color choice for your pet's name to be painted on the bed.

            100% wool handmade cat caves, cat love them! 
Modelled by Cheeky Paws, Meimei, Fou du Fafa, Coco and Patience!
Sizes:
*Size Small: fits a tiny kitten to a 3.5 kg cat - roughly 38cms across (14.95""), 15cms high (5.9"")
*Size Medium: fits up to a 4 to 5 kg cat - roughly 42 cms across (16.5""), 17 cms high (6.7"")
*Size Large: fits a cat over 5 kg - they also fit a small dog - roughly 45 cms across (17.7""),19 cms high (7.48"")
*Size X Large (ragdolls/maine coones): roughly 48cms across (18.9""), 20/21 cms high (8"")
Colour: grey on the bottom and 1/3 of the top and the rest is dyed wool - inside layer is grey or white)
If you prefer the colour on the inside, just let us know in the order notes 
All my cat caves come with a couple of catnip scented handmade felted toy balls :)
Shipping:
So it doesn't get squashed and is easier to reshape when you get it, your cat cave is posted in a box.
We recommend you select a tracked delivery service if you prefer a tracking number with your order, please have a read of the Shipping and Policies tab :)
Care:
When you receive the cat cave, take it out of the box straight away and fluff it back into shape. Do not leave it folded in the box for longer than is necessary and it is better to avoid flattening or folding it subsequently if at all possible.
As cats come in many shapes and sizes, we don't cut the opening very large - which is fine if your kitteh is slender, however if it is a very fluffly one then you will need to cut the opening bigger - just grab a good enough pair of scissors and cut into the felt - it's pretty easy. 
Some cats will not venture in the cat cave if the opening is too narrow for them.
Visit us on facebook for more pictures of happy cats and their cat caves :)

            The Jam that started it all! Even though I'm lucky enough to have s tree in my backyard quantities are limited of this beautiful jam. I just adore Guava Jam with bree, mohan, or really any mild soft cheese and some toast. I fell in love with Guava jam while on vacation in Hawaii a few years back and just had to have more! Living on the mainland it isn't the easiest stuff to find. Guava's on the other hand when in season are at all the ethic markets here in CA. I even have a few friends with fruit baring trees! (mine has yet to produce) Once you taste this Jam I just know you will fall in-love too!
This order is for a 8oz (1/2pint) homemade Guava Jam. This recipe does include some citrus. If you have allergies please message me with any questions.
For optimum flavor and freshness- Store in a cool, dry place and use within one year of processed date listed on jar. Refrigerate after opening.
***Because I use only fresh ingredients colors of Jams may vary based on season and availability. 
**Any shipping overages will be promptly returned after shipment has been made.
*Custom flavors or orders will require a 100piece minimum and payment before processing fruit.

8275,"Handmade Deodorant, All Natural, Aluminum Free, No Baking Soda","
            All Natural Aluminum Free Handmade Deodorant without Baking Soda 
Our deodorant recipe is formulated to be gentle on the skin and contains no Baking Soda. **Many people are sensitive to deodorant recipes containing baking soda. This solid deodorant comes in a 2oz twist up tube for convenient use. 
Please note: the ingredients in our natural deodorants do not prevent perspiration, which is the body's natural way of cooling down and riding itself of toxins, by using essential oils and other natural components like arrowroot powder and kaolin clay, these ingredients absorb the sweat and kill odor-causing bacteria. Because of these differences with using a natural deodorant, please allow your body time to adjust. During high activity levels or hot days, re-apply as needed. 
Ingredients:
Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Mango Butter, Shea Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Arrowroot Powder, Kaolin Clay, Vitamin E oil and/or Essential Oil, Fragrance Oil.
~Please store in a cool dry place~
We offer deodorants made with Essential Oils and scents made with Fragrance Oils. The only scents made with fragrance oils are tobacco & bay leaf, coconut lemongrass, tobacco & spice, oatmeal stout, ginger patchouli, sweet citrus, spiced mahogany, cranberry fig, lavender cedar and crisp cotton. Deodorant scents made with orange essential orange may have an orange hue to them, but will not look orange on the skin. 
*Please discontinue use if skin irritation occurs* 
**Please note, due to a recent batch of white kaolin clay being slightly darker than previous shipments, deodorants may not be as bright white as pictured on this listing**        ",6.95,4.9412,"Handmade item

9023,Belly Butter - Organic Pregnancy Moisturizer - Stretch mark cream - belly to baby - pregnancy gift - whipped shea,"
            ***This listing is for the 3.79 fluid ounce glass jar.  We offer larger, 7.40 fluid ounce glass jars on all of our butters as well 
http://etsy.me/2jv7H2e.
GEN Mama Belly Butter is made from only the best ingredients!  The organic oils, butters, and essential oils were carefully selected and handcrafted into a product that you can be sure contains no dangerous chemicals. Because no water is used in this formula, not only is it highly concentrated, but also does not require the use of a preservative.  However, it is necessary to protect the delicate oils and even the butters from light to keep them from oxidizing  With our specialized jars, you can be sure that absolutely no light can get to you product therefore it will last longer and stay fresher for months.  
Suggestions for use:  
We recommend using in the very beginning of pregnancy to aid in preparing the skin for the changes it will undergo during the next few months.  However, it is never too late to start!  
Apply all over the skin paying special attention to the areas that will experience rapid growth such as the belly and hips.  Apply any time and as many times as needed, but make sure to apply after each shower or bath to lock in the moisture and prevent any dryness that might occur.  
After the birth, it is best to continue using this butter to help the skin regain its firmness and elasticity.  
GEN Mama Belly Butter was designed to melt into the skin on contact.  In order to preserve the whipped texture of this butter, keep out of direct sunlight and store in a cool place.  Rewhipping instructions for this butter will be included in your order.
Enjoy your radiant skin!
***This butter is packed into a beautiful Miron glass jar that makes an excellent gift!  After the butter has all been used, the jar can be reused, repurposed, or recycled so it is incredibly eco-friendly!  Read more about this amazing UV filtering glass below!

SCENT AND TEXTURE
______________________________________
Because we use unrefined/non-deodorized cocoa butter, our body and belly butters may have an aroma of chocolate. We chose to use certified organic unrefined/non-deodorized cocoa butter because it has not undergone any type of chemical bleaching and it contains tons of antioxidants that are incredibly beneficial for the skin! These antioxidants also make cocoa butter very shelf stable and allows it to often last for 5 years before any rancidity occurs. 
The texture of this butter is whipped. It can melt during hot temperatures (please see our heat warning for more info on this). Because we use no fillers or water, this butter is highly concentrated. This means that it will have a heavier texture or ‚Äúfeel‚Äù than a lotion which does contain water. The benefit is that your skin will get to enjoy the benefits of this heavier texture and be even more protected from moisture loss.
______________________________________
HEAT WARNING
______________________________________
Important Warning on Shipping!  Because our Body and Belly Butters are completely natural with no stabilizers, dangerous chemicals, or even waxes, the condition of your order may be affected by heat during shipping.   If the Butters do heat up, the texture will change.  The Butters are still wonderfully moisturizing for your skin, but when heated they will lose their ‚Äúwhipped‚Äù texture and become more dense.  It is possible to re-whip the butters after they have cooled down to achieve the original texture again.  If the Butters should melt during transit, we cannot be responsible or issue refunds.

UV GLASS JARS AND BOTTLES
______________________________________
We aim to offer the purest body and home care items possible.  To accomplish this, we have to store our products in a way that protects their potency and life without adding any dangerous chemicals or preservatives.  We dug into the research and after much contemplation, we decided the best way to offer our customers highest quality products was to select Miron glass jars and bottles.  
Miron glass is a deep purple color and very different from your average glass bottle or jar. Clear, blue, green, and brown colored glass bottles/jars all allow visible light to pass through to the product contained within.  This means that the delicate ingredients, those same ingredients that are supposed to supply nourishment to your skin, would be degraded.  Ingredients simply cannot stay as fresh when exposed to visible light.  This is what makes Miron Violet Glass so special.  The completely unique properties of Miron glass means that only violet light and the spectral range of UV-A and infrared light can pass through while all visible light cannot.  These frequencies of light have been found to protect while visible light accelerates decomposition.  UV-A light, which can pass through Miron glass, is responsible for slowing down growth of bacteria, mold, and pathogens. Infrared light, which Miron glass also allows through, has been shown to have healing properties.  The dynamic energy of the nourishing products contained within this specialty glass is preserved thereby making it perfect for storing any type of remedy including ones for your skin.

DISCLAIMER
______________________________________
Because we use many unrefined and herbal ingredients, it is possible to find some tiny fragments of organic materials such as herbs from an oil infusion in you product.  Since we make all of our products in very small batches, and we use no water in our recipes, we have no need for preservatives. We feel confident saying that our products should last at least one year from the time that you receive them. Keeping all of the products clean and dry by not using wet hands to scoop out any of the products will help all of the products stay fresh. ‚Ä®
Since we use only natural ingredients and no fillers or chemical stabilizers, sometimes the products can separate a bit (ex. white flakes of cocoa or shea butter in a salve or cream or product ‚Äúpulling away‚Äù from the sides of a jar) when exposed to extremes in temperature over time. This does not affect the quality of the product or the moisturizing effects; it is simply just a change in appearance and sometimes the texture. To return any of the creams, balms, or salves to their original state (this does not include any of the whipped butters!), it is simple to place the tin in a heat proof dish and heat up the cream gently in a low temperature set oven (please use caution and let the dish/tin cool before touching as the tin can get very hot even in a low temp oven!). After cooling, the product will once again regain its original consistency. ‚Ä®
Safety:  While these products are considered safe for most skin types, persons with contact allergies to the Asteraceae, or Compositae family should exercise caution. As with all topical items, it is wise to always do a skin test to check for any reactions before using on large areas. Use caution if applying to open wounds. Discontinue use if irritation occurs.
Pregnancy:  While we use no toxins of any kind in our products, nor do we use a percentage of essential oils that is considered harmful during pregnancy or breastfeeding (we strive to use no more than half of the recommended lowest safe dose of 1% in our pregnancy/breastfeeding products), we still recommend using your own instincts with all items.  We also always recommend discussing your skin care products with a health practitioner whom you trust as well as doing your own research.  Everyone is different and can respond to skin care products differently especially during pregnancy.  
General: While we are happy to always answer any of your questions, we are not qualified to give medical advice. Our information would be considered for educational purposes only. Our information has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. We recommend that you consult with a qualified healthcare practitioner if you have concerns about using any herbal, essential oil, or fixed oil/butter products, particularly if you are pregnant, nursing, or on any medications.

            Here we have a crochet octopus which has been the product of a recent study to help premature babies. The comforters have even resulted in improved breathing, increased regular heartbeats and higher levels of oxygen in their blood.
For more information please have a read on this website http://www.prima.co.uk/family/kids/news/a37423/crocheted-octopuses-help-premature-babies/ 
The little fighters are given a flashback to the calming sea of being in their mum‚Äôs belly with an umbilical cord to hold onto. The tentacles are also useful for deterring the teeny tots from attempting to pull out their monitors and tubes.
They can be made in any colour of your choosing, a few examples of wool colours I have has been photographed for you to see. If you would like a different colour then please let me know in the 'note to seller' when you place your order. I can change the style of the eyes.. put a bow on them, a top hat literally anything you like! The octopuses have sleepy eyes so he/she can rest with the baby.
They are handmade with soft cotton baby wool and are crocheted into shape tightly. They are filled with toy stuffing and are CE tested.
They are conveniently machine washable, so you can just throw him in and off you go. Would be a perfect gift for someone who has given birth to a premature baby or for your little one who loves the sea!
They are the perfect size for a newborn crib and for an incubator. All parcel sent to (UK) is a Signed for service. Outside of UK is not.

11276,Large men Claddagh ring in sterling silver,"
            A larger version of the claddagh ring, for the ones with larger finger or who like big chunky rings. Available from size 6 to size 16. Handmade to your size, available oxidized or polish. 
The legendary Claddagh ring first fathomed in the heart of ancient Ireland, passed down from mother to daughter. And given only to the first to be married. It was highly prized and those that still exist from the past are truly ancient. Hands to show friendship, heart, to show love, and a crown to link them all with loyalty, fidelity, and friendship for life.
A man named Richard Joyce tells of a compelling story where he left his loved one behind to seek work in the west Indies. He left her in Ireland saying that he would marry her when he returns. But on the way his ship was raided by a corsair who sold him into slavery to a Moorish goldsmith. The goldsmith quickly put him to work and he proved to be a quick learner. 
Things changed when William III took the throne he demanded that all British citizens in captivity must be released immediately, the government intimidated by William, reluctantly agreed. The gold smith enticed Richard Joyce with many things included half of his wealth and even his daughters hand in marriage. But his love for his Irish wife to be was too great and he returned home to her presenting a claddagh ring, which he made while in captivity.

11384,1950 Shaker Furniture Catalog  w/William F. Winter Photographs American Primitives,"
            This listing is for a soft cover book entitled ""Shaker Furniture The Craftsmanship of an American Communal Sect"" by Edward Deming Andrews and Faith Edward. The photographs are by William F. Winter. This book is the result of 15 years of the authors winning the trust and cooperation of the remaining Shaker Communities in the late 1930's without which this valuable information about  American Art culture and religious history would have been lost. 
It was published by Dover Publications in 1950. The first edition was a hard cover published in 1937.
Condition: Good. There is wear along the edges of the cover and spine and the previous owner wrote his name on the cover page.

13319,"Purple flower Linziclip hair clamp, Purple floral hair claw, purple wedding flowers, special occasion hair, ballerina clip, festival hair","
            Pretty mix of purple colour flowers make up this floral hair clamp.
Purple, lilac and lavender  flowers fill the maxi Linziclip hair claw to make a very attractive headpiece suitable for any special occasion.
Great for weddings, parties, races, festivals or just when you ant to dress an up-do with something unique.
A Linziclip is a new type of hair clamp with a lovely flat back, each claw moves separately and I'm able to fill the flat back with flowers. (No sticking out butterfly wings)
I can make more looking similar but as they're handmade each one will be a little different, just as all flowers are.
This can be made on a large croc clip or barrette if preferred.
I can make wrist corsages and headbands to match, please convo me.
Smoke free/pet free home.
Please checkout my other flower fascinators to see what other colours I can make them in.
Thank you for looking.        ",16.58,4.9412,"Handmade item

On the right foot there is a thin crack in the rubber sole. 
But these are meant to be worn in dry cold time in dry snow, 
so the slight crack should not be a problem at all.
 Because there are felt boots like this without any rubber at all,
 and they are totally fine in dry snow.
These boots would make also a cute decoration.
Size-marked - 23 European
Measurements-outside sole-16.5 cm/6.5''
