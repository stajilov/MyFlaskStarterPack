Lionel Corporation was an American toy manufacturer and retailer that was in business from 1900-1995. Founded as an electrical novelties company, Lionel specialized in various products throughout its existence, but toy trains and model railroads were its main claim to fame.[1] Lionel trains, produced from 1900 to 1969, drew admiration from model railroaders around the world for the solidity of their construction and the authenticity of their detail. During its peak years in the 1950s, the company sold 25 million worth of trains per year.[2] In 2006, Lionel's electric train, along with the Easy-Bake Oven, became the first electric toy inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame.
Lionel remains the most enduring brand name associated with model trains in the United States, its products prized by collectors. Today, Lionel, LLC owns all of the trademarks and most of the product rights associated with the Lionel Corporation; there is, however, no direct connection between the two companies.

357,Vintage Hi Flier Paper Kite Purple Ice Cream Sundae Float Graphic Wall Decor Two Stick Instructions Chex Promo Camper Outdoor Kids Activity,"
            Bright purple paper kite from around early 1970s with an old-fashion ice cream sundae or float graphic.  Fun to fly or use as wall decor. Made by the  Hi-Flier Kite Co. I don't believe this was ever used as the kite was still rolled tightly, tied with string and the instructions are still rolled up with the kite. See photo 5. This kite and three others came in a mailing box that has the address typed on it. The kite is paper with a crinkly waxy covering.
Measures about 26 inches long. No tail is included. In  good vintage condition with some wrinkles, color fading/staining and spots here and there. There is also a 1/4 inch size tear at the top right below where the string loop is. I may have done it while trying to take pictures :(. 
I will be listing the other kites as well. I believe these have been rolled up since the person received them over 50 years ago.
Please review all five photos for more info on condition.
Shipping is based on shipping to the coasts, any overage beyond 2.00 will be refunded once shipped. Insurance and tracking are included in the shipping cost. ALASKA and HAWAII buyers please contact me before purchasing to calculate your shipping costs.

A little history on the Hi-Flier Kite company;
It was launched in Decatur in the 1920s by Harvey A. Sellers. He was a paper supplies salesman who made kites out of samples to amuse kids. Then he felt the tug of opportunity and began production in his basement.
His grandson, John Sellers, says the business had soared to be the nation's top paper kite-maker by the 1960s. Hi-Flier had a factory and 200 employees. A large part of their business was printing advertising kites for companies like Kroger stores.
Sellers father, Harvey Sellers Jr., later took over and Sellers' brother, Stuart, worked in it before running his own printing business. Sellers worked for Hi-Flier briefly and then joined the Navy in the early 1970s. That's when he got a call saying the business was sold.        ",12.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1970s

837,Eisenberg Ice Multi-Color Rhinestones Christmas Tree Shaped Pin and Matching Pierced Earrings (Inventory #J290),"
            Another beautiful Eisenberg Ice listing! This one has a gold tone Christmas tree pin and matching pierced earrings. Both have faceted, round, multi-color rhinestone “decorations”. 
Pin measures 2” long (at longest), 1 ½” wide (at widest), and is marked Eisenberg Ice. 
Earrings are pierced style, measure 5/8” long (at longest), and 3/8” wide (at widest). Because of their small size, they are unmarked. 
Lovely set! 
I have mentioned in some of my Eisenberg Ice listings about item authenticity. Each of the Eisenberg Ice items that I have listed, even if unmarked, is a real Eisenberg piece. The majority of the items have been a part of my personal collection for many years and others were items that I purchased when I was an Eisenberg dealer -- yes, I was a dealer for Eisenberg Ice -- which played a very large part in my having so many pieces in my own collection (i.e. one to sell and one for me!).
Please note: as with all my listings, the quoted shipping is a best guess estimate only. I refund all overages above 2.00 whether it is a single item purchase or multiple items in a single transaction.        ",80.00,4.9886,"Vintage item

            Even though I don’t buy many magazines now, I still save my favorites from the past.  
This magazine rack has been sanded, cleaned, and spray painted with 2 coats of black satin (semi-gloss).  It’s in excellent condition.  It sure would be cute in a black and white bathroom!  You could even roll up towels in it.  Or in a kitchen to hold some cook books.  But the basic black can go in any room.        (Photo props are not included.)
Size:  Footprint is 16” long x 5-1/2” wide.  From floor to top of handle is 17” tall.  The side view distance across the 2 large arrows is 9-1/2”.  Total width at the bottom where magazines sit is 4-1/4”.  The front view distance across the 2 large arrows is 9-1/2”.

            Frayed Cutoffs High Waist Denim Shorts 32 Waist
A must have for a versatile wardrobe, these denim cutoff shorts were made out of a pair of 90s denim jeans. 
Crafted out of a medium wash 100% cotton denim, these shorts pair well with almost any outfit imaginable. 
The high waisted fit makes for super comfy wear - no more having to pull at your shorts to keep them from falling down. 
Not only are they comfortable, but they're undeniably cute as well; pair with a crop top or a tucked in tee for easy summer style. 
They have been cut with your body's natural curves in mind, and frayed for a relaxed, casual vibe.

SIZING:
------WILL FIT OVERSIZED-------
Order the size you normally wear in clothes. If you order larger, it may be too big.
Vintage label size is inaccurate, vintage sizing isn't comparable to modern sizing due to sizing standards changing over the different Eras. Most vintage sizing runs small, so we resize everything to modern sizing and you will receive the size you order. Many of these are originally vintage men's sweaters resized.
*If you are a boy, you may want to purchase a size larger if you want it over-sized. If you want it more fitted then order the size you normally wear in shirts.*
CONDITION:
We strive to send the best condition possible. Because these items are 20 years old, some minor damage may be on your item including: small blemishes, small tears, minor piling. Nothing will be anything I consider noticeable.
SHIPPING:
Please allow 2-3 Business days to process item before shipping.

____________________
SIZE SUGGESTIONS
Keep in mind, the vintage denim tends to run a bit smaller than today's sizing, and the material is a bit thick. Due to this, depending on how snug you want them to fit, most people move up one or two sizes from their regular fit. 
I like to breathe a bit more in mine, and have thicker legs, so I move from a US size 6-8 to a size 10-12 when I where these. 
____________________
SIZE NOT AVAILABLE?
I only list the sizes that I currently have available, to guarantee quick shipping to your doorstep. If you do not see your size in stock, keep in mind that I restock once or twice a week. If you ""follow"" my shop it will keep you updated on any additional listings.
____________________
LENGTH
These shorts are made to fully cover your bottom. However, If you want them longer or shorter, just add that to the comment of your order. I'd be happy to accommodate that.

Two patches--one with the Gymboree ""G"" and one with a fish--add to the awesomeness.  Tag reads Medium, would estimate this about a 4T.  Measurements provided in pics.  If you have any other questions, though, just let me know! This one's a winner. Only flaw I noticed is a bit of scratching on one button.  Otherwise, in very good condition!

5437,Vintage 1980's Pair of Tiffany Silver Belt Buckles,"
            If you're really into vintage silver and you love Tiffany (come on, who doesn't?), these two pieces from my personal collection are perfect for you. Measuring 2"" across (with the buckle), 1"" wide and 1/8"" deep, the vintage sterling buckles are in marvelous shape, with some age-appropriate, yet slight scratching on the engine-turned design. Each piece is marked Tiffany sterling.
The initials read EAS and EES, (an anniversary presents from my mother to my ex and myself), however Tiffany assures me that. our monograms can be removed, if you want a clean slate. I am willing to sell the buckles separately for 159.98 each.
Of course, you could always buy these new at a Tiffany store. But what would be the fun of that? Especially at twice the price!
Alas, I can not ship these internationally.        ",199.00,4.8261,"Vintage item from the 1980s

6076,ONE COLOR OMBRE / 100% Cotton Dog Leash//4 foot dog leash//ombre dog leash//custom dog leash//dog lead//Rope dog leash//Christmas Dog Leash,"
            This listing is for a single (1) color ombre leash. Every leash fades into the natural cotton color.
PLEASE READ FULL DESCRIPTION BEFORE ORDERING.
PRODUCT: 
Our leashes are made of 100% cotton rope and colored using pet safe dyes. They are soft and comfortable, yet very durable. We use heavy duty bolt snaps that firmly secure your pet's collar. 100% cotton twine is used to secure all splices (loops) and is dyed to match your leash. 
PROCESS: 
Each item is custom made. Every rope leash is first spliced and whipped by hand then individually dyed. Please let me know BEFORE you order if you need an item by a particular date.
CARE:
Our leashes may be spot-washed in cold water only with a mild detergent and laid out to dry. Cotton can shrink when wet so please keep a close eye on your leash while it dries. If shrinking occurs, pulling on it gently while wet should bring it back to it's original length.
SIZES:
Our leashes come in two different widths: 3/8 inch and 1/2 inch.
-1/2 inch is recommended for pets 50 pounds and over.
-3/8 inch is recommended for pets up to 50 pounds. However if you have a strong puller or heavy chewer you may want to choose the 1/2 inch leash for a little extra durability.
IMPORTANT INFO. PLEASE READ BEFORE ORDERING.
**Cotton has a tendency to shrink and expand naturally depending on weather conditions and moisture. Please take this into consideration when using this product. We are not responsible for any shrinking/expanding that occurs during the shipping process or during use after sent to buyer. 
**Colors may look slightly different than pictured. We try to get our photos as accurate as possible. Please take this into consideration when placing your order. In addition, because every item is custom made, no two items are exactly the same and the item you order may vary slightly from the photo. 
**Please note that no leash is indestructible. Keep a close watch for wear and tear and replace when necessary. We will not be responsible for any mishaps that may occur due to the use of our product; the buyer is solely responsible for the product after it is shipped.        ",24.00,4.9266,"Handmade item

S I Z E / W E I G H T... 9 in x 6 in x 2 in. and approx. 10 pounds
Hello... and WELCOME.....Rough with the smooth, dark with the light, and always a bit of sparkle and shine; that is the style of Blessing and Light. Every item I create is intended to bless and bring light.☀
☼ The most versatile rustic decor you will ever own or give away! It can be used both indoors or out...perfect for those who love to rearrange:) Place it on a bookshelf, use it as a door stop, put it by the kitchen sink or set it amongst your flowers. These look beautiful in planters as well as on a fireplace mantle.
☼ Each “stone” starts with a rustic tumbled concrete paver. There is no vinyl used on any stone. A variety of high quality inks, stains and paints are applied. The stone is then sealed with an exterior sealer which allows you to place it indoors or out.
☼ The slight variation in color and “flaws” is part of the rustic appeal. I only choose stones that I would want to receive and best suit the design being created on them.
✦ ✦ ✦ ✦ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS/ COMMENTS ✦ ✦ ✦ ✦ 
✹ HOW ARE THESE SHIPPED? ... USPS Priority Mail (1-3 day delivery) Each is “rustically wrapped” with wide kraft paper.  These heavy “stones” are then packaged with care to ensure a safe delivery. 
✹ EXPECTED TIME FROM ORDER TO SHIPPING... From 3-4 business days (depending on the amount of stones I am working on). 
✹ I NEED IT ASAP... Add the ""RUSH MY ORDER"" at checkout
✹ DO YOU TAKE CUSTOM PIECES? Yes, I love creating new pieces or tweaking ones I have to make it exactly what you are looking for. Again, just ask...I try to do my best getting back to you quickly. 
✹ THIS IS A GIFT... Great! I do not put any invoicing in my packages/boxes and I can include a handwritten card. Leave me the message you want written in the ""NOTE TO blessingandlight"" (which will appear at checkout below the picture)

            The perfect care package to send someone who is grieving. 
Lynneys Comforts are a wonderful gift to send a friend or family member to help soothe them during any stage of grief. The five piece set includes Lavender Bath Salts, Lavender Cream, Lavender Essential Oil Pulse Point Roll-on, Scented Candle and a Gel Beaded Hot/Cold Eye Mask. 
Lavender is calming, soothing and relaxing. After a nice bath using the lavender bath salts, the roll-on can be applied to wrists, pulse points and temples to help promote a restful feeling. The eye mask is something I wish I would have received sooner in my grief journey to soothe my eyes after crying. 
This Grief Survivor guided journal will help your loved one know what they might expect in the days ahead. The 28 chapters uncover genuine grief topics such as navigating the holidays, releasing regrets and getting “unstuck.” This productive grief journal walks the reader through these issues and encourages them to reflect on their own feelings as well as record special memories of their loved one. Help them through their grief with this beautiful guided journal by Beth Marshall who wrote this after losing close family members. Only after writing and connecting with other people experiencing grief, she realized a joy-filled life after loss really is possible. 
All items are beautifully packaged in a gift box and include a card on how to use the products as well as a personalized gift card from you. Please include a note how you would like your name to read for the Gift Card.

Disclaimer: All That's Rustic is not responsible for any bodily injury, such as splinters, etc. We do our best sanding down our wood products to the best of our ability without taking away the natural beauty of the wood. Some wood pieces may show nail heads, nail holes, or knicks, but we feel this gives the most true rustic look of all! We wouldn't send out something we wouldn't put in our own homes! Some stain colors may vary since all our wood is hand selected and all different due to it being reclaimed, but it will be in the general shade of stain :) Review our shop policies.

8019,"String of Pearls - Senecio rowleyanus - 6"" Hanging Basket","
            String of pearls hanging basket. Great for gardens, patios, or indoors window sill.  Senecio rowleyanus, commonly known as string-of-pearls or string-of-beads, is a creeping, perennial, succulent vine belonging to the family Asteraceae. This plant was named after British botanist Gordon Douglas Rowley who specialized in Cactaceae and succulents. It is native to the drier parts of southwest Africa. In its natural environment its stems trail on the ground, rooting where they touch and forming dense mats. It often avoids direct sunlight by growing in the shade of other plants and rocks.
Fertilizer: Use either a balanced or low-nitrogen formula at low levels, but frequently---March through October. Soil: Should be loose and porous like a cactus soil.
Succulents are grown in dry, arid climates, so it is important to make sure they have a good drainage with soil that is specifically designed for succulents.   Reduce watering in fall and winter to once or twice a month depending on your climate.
You will receive String of pearls hanging basket similar to pictures above.
Hanging basket size: 4.25 inches deep, 6 inches circumference. 
Succulents need the sun to survive; take them out of the box as soon as you receive them.
Instructions to care for your plants will be included in package.
If you are ordering from areas below 35 degrees, we have 72 hour heat packs available for purchase to protect your plants during transit.
Before checking out, please make sure your address is correct or else your shipment may be delayed.

8619,"Greyt Greyhound Stone Art (donation to Greyhound Welfare) Verdigris, Pet Lover Gift, Greyhound Rescue","
            Pictured here is my sculpture, Greyt Greyhound, capturing the fastest dog in cast stone. My original design was hand-carved, and this example cast from a mold I made of my original plaster bas relief carving. It is 3"" by 8 3/4"" and weighs a pound. A metal hook is embedded in the back, and it can be hung indoors or out.
I will contribute a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Greyt Greyhound to the Greyhound Welfare rescue organization, a 501(c)3 charity and greyhound rescue organization based in Takoma Park, Maryland. We adopted our wonderful greyhound from them in May 2011.
I will hand cast your Greyt Greyhound in my home studio.  Cast stone is a combination of mineral oxide pigments, C-144 masonry sand, marble dust, and blends of white and gray portland cements. Once cured, I will process your sculpture with a complex collection of metallic and interference colors over a black base (Finish A 7 12 31). Interference paints create subtle changes in color based on the type and direction of light. The mineral oxide pigments I use in my finishes are 100% permanent and lightfast. Greyt Greyhound is further protected from the elements by a UV barrier coating.        ",24.00,4.9726,"Handmade item

8941,1940's Vintage / Gilette Safety Razor / Steampunk Razor / Mechanical Razor / Double Edge Razor / Stainless Steel Safety Razor,"
            Here's a nice piece of vintage shaving gear for you. This is a Gillette, double edge safety razor from the 1930's or 40's. 
The unit has a stainless steel nurled handle with automatic, stainless steel head. 
The razor is in good condition. It does show quite a bit of use and the mechanical action sticks a bit, but the razor is functional and should give you a good shave. 
If you're looking for a workaday razor to take on a camping trip or other low-key mission, this would fit the bill. 
I'm confident that this item will certainly make for a unique addition to any collection.

9106,"Montessori Silent E Reading Blocks, Educational Toy, Beginning Reader Tools, Long Vowel, Magic E","
            These blocks are great for introducing Silent E to young readers. Once your child has mastered reading the three-letter Phonetic Reading Blocks, introduce these Silent E blocks. Your child will love twisting the end block to reveal and hide the Silent E to create words with both short and long vowel sounds.  
Easy to use, first show the child a 3 letter phonetic word of your choice. Have the child read the word. Then, twist the block so that the ""e"" appears at the end of the word. Explain to the child that in this word, the ""e"" does not make a sound, but it does have a job. Tell the child that the ""e"" makes the vowel say it's name. For example: man becomes mane, fad becomes fade and so on. Practice reading the new word together. Show the child another word with the same vowel. Continue reading words in this manner, helping when necessary and eventually moving on to other vowels.
The blocks allow practice with all 5 vowel sounds plus 12 different consonants and 1 phonogram. Each rod includes 4 phonetic words  4 silent E words, giving your little reader a total of 40 words to read over and over. All words are in the dictionary. A fun tool to strengthen and improve your child's self-confidence with reading and use of long vowel sounds.
Made to replace or compliment your Montessori Silent E Word Cards. The letters are written in lower case d'nealian print with red consonants and blue vowels, in order to match the rest of your Montessori Language materials. A must have language work for the Montessori 3-6 year old classroom.
Handmade with natural unfinished wood and non-toxic ink and glue. Sets may have slight imperfections/variations since each one is handmade & unique.

Includes:
5 Reading Block Rods with middle sounds A,E,I,O,& U. Each one is 4.5 inches long by 3/4 inch wide.

            ****************************************
Why we honor and insist on hand sew our leather product ?
Leather sewing machines commonly use the ""lock stitch"" , If just one loop of a lock stitch is broken, the other side will automatically be loosened, often this process of unraveling will continue until the entire product is ruined.
Hand sewing (saddle stitch) will not unravel if one loop is broken.
Though slower, hand sewing is superior to machine sewing. It is the best way to sew leather together,the hand-sew leather product will be more durable and stand the test of time !!

10504,Recycled Seat Belt Guitar Strap - Vegan Eco Friendly Guitar Strap - 8 colors to choose from,"
            The Vegan Eco Strap has always been a best seller at Couch. It's simply the best-made, best-looking, most functional vegan guitar strap available anywhere in the world at the best price.  Know also that we've thoroughly considered how this product relates to the world around us, not only by making this strap cruelty free and vegan, but by using 100% recycled seat belt materials, and making this USA made strap sweatshop free, locally here where we live, in Los Angeles, California.
This finely made simple strap is our finest industrial design accomplishment to date and it's a great affordable strap for you guitar. For a little over 20 bucks, it's also a great gift for all your guitar playing friends.
Instead of the cheap nylon webbing most mega-production Chinese-made strap makers use, we use recycled automotive seat belt webbing that that will never break, looks great, and adjusts extra easy and smooth. We also cut the strap about 6 inches longer than the average guitar strap for those who are bigger or who like to play low.
We then sew on our own special vegan end-tabs that are die-cut and made of heavy duty automotive upholstery vinyl on the outside, and further strengthened by a folded-over double layer of super sturdy and flexible carbon fiber cloth on the inside of the strap. Like all our vinyl straps this guitar strap also has a trio of hand tooled stainless steel rivets on the back tab and the front end tab is sewn on with a sturdy x-box stitch for an ultra sleek look and now features sewing around the keyholes for even more strength.
Pictured left to right in the first photo, this strap is available in Mellow Gold, Navy, Army Green, Industrial Orange, Classic Maroon,  Industrial Silver, Graphite, and Black.  Too see more pics of a particular color, there are also individual listings on our main Seat Belts page for each strap. There you will also find our newest color Brown. Please state which color you would like at check out.
ROCK!

10574,Dying Poet by L.M. Gottschalk Published by Eclisple Publishing Co. Philadelphia 1907,"
            Description: Antique sheet music, Dying Poet by L.M. Gottschalk, 1907.  Cool gothic graphics. Unusual theme would make a great framed conversation piece.
Dimensions (approximate): 10-1/4 x 13-1/2 inches
Condition: Fair condition. 102 year old antique paper sheet music which has soiling, stains, tears and marks from use. Back and front cover separated by tear. Please look at the pictures carefully before placing your order.
History: By the 1860s, Gottschalk had established himself as the best known pianist in the New World. In May 1865, he was mentioned in a San Francisco newspaper as having ""travelled 95,000 miles by rail and given 1,000 concerts"". Gottschalk chose to travel to South America, where he continued to give frequent concerts. During one of these concerts, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on November 24, 1869, he collapsed from having contracted yellow fever. Just before his collapse, he had finished playing his romantic piece Morte! (translated from Brazilian Portuguese as ""Death""), although the actual collapse occurred just as he started to play his celebrated piece Tremolo. Gottschalk never recovered from the collapse. Three weeks later, on December 18, 1869, at the age of 40, he died at his hotel in Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, probably from an overdose of quinine.

10711,Things We Don't Talk About: Women's Stories from the Red Tent,"
            Things We Don’t Talk About: Woman’s Stories from the Red Tent is a groundbreaking 72-minute documentary film by award winning filmmaker Isadora Gabrielle Leidenfrost, PhD. Spontaneous and organic, a Red Tent is a red textile space where women gather to rest, renew, and often share deep and powerful stories about their lives. The Red Tent movement is changing the way that women interact and support each other by providing a place that honors and celebrates women, and by enabling open conversations about the things that women don’t want to talk about in other venues. Things We Don’t Talk About weaves together healing narratives from inside the Red Tent to shine a spotlight on this vital, emergent women’s tradition. The film provides us an opportunity to remember, to listen, to know, and to find what it is we need to bring back to our communities to help awaken the voices of women.
This DVD is subtitled in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Hebrew, and English (cc). This film is intended for a mature audience.        ",25.00,4.6667,"Handmade item

            Floral Brooch poppy jewelry, Real flower Red brooch, Red flower brooch Statement flower jewelry Red gift idea girlfriend flower gift for her
This is an actual and real pressed flower that has been dried to maintain its color and shape and then immersed in several coats of eco resin. It is naturally beautiful and also very durable. The color has been enhanced with ink. This Resin jewelry is suitable for everyday use but indispensable for wedding and other special occasions.
I made this brooch myself from start to finish. All my designs are crafted individually by hand, so there will always be some variation and imperfection. Just as in nature, no two items are identical in my shop. This is a stock image and your brooch might slightly differ from the picture because of the natural shape and color of the real plant but this just adds to its uniqueness. 
Lightweight. Antique Bronze Nickel Free clasp .
Flower Size approx 4 - 5 cm (1 1/2 to 2"")
International shipping is done by registered (tracking number) and priority air mail.

            Hello!
I’m Anna, a designer and dressmaker based near Brighton in the UK. I design and make every dress here in my home studio at the seaside for my bridal wear label; ‘This Modern Love’. 
About This Modern Love
The aesthetic for ‘This Modern Love’ is romantic, feminine, bohemian and beautifully simple dresses, all hand crafted using the finest materials such as silk chiffon, corded lace, duchess satin and soft tulle.  My dresses are designed in a delicate colour palette including of ivory, nude and blush tones, though lots more colours are available.
All of my dresses are a relaxed, pull on style which cinch in at the waist with elastic - they are not structured or fitted. Because of this, my designs feel comfortable, lightweight and fluid. My customers are often women looking for a relaxed, vintage style or bohemian dress, with a woodland, rustic or festival theme to their wedding: brides looking for something simple, beautiful and original.

13999,USA made Tahkli Indian-Style Support Spindle Coin Takli,"
            This little Indian-style metal support spindle is approximately 7"" long and weighs 18g.  There is a flattened hook at the top that is very well designed:  It can be used to start a leader by slipping a small amount of fiber around the hook, and the leader thread naturally falls into this 45 degree notch while spinning when spiraled up the shaft.  Also, the flattened hook's profile places the leader as close to the center of rotation as possible.  Although this spindle can be used as a drop spindle, it is most efficient when used as a support spindle.  It is best used for spinning fine, short fibers such as cotton, bison, camel down, yak down, and cashmere.  It is also good for long slippery fibers like silk.  Handmade in the USA, this is the finest tahkli I have spun on, with exceptional balance and speed.  Stamped on the bottom by the master metalsmith as seen in photo #2.
Metals:  black painted steel shaft and brass whorl

The mask pattern that you are buying is designed to fit an adult and you should not need to adjust the scaling. Please print the file at 100% the same size as the original document. If you want to use this template for children, you can scale it down to 80% using your printer settings.
Paint the finished mask, as you like to create your own personal design)
Submit shots of your completed mask at https://www.instagram.com/_shame_shame/ or view what others have been doing!
Have you problems? Сontact with me.
Lots of effort has gone into the creation of the design template. The masks were physically constructed several times and the template has been improved by looking at the model to get the best final result. You can use the template to make as many masks as you want but we request you to kindly not use the template for commercial purposes or share the templates with anyone.
We are grateful for your feedback, you can help us become better!        ",6.00,5.0,"Handmade Supply

16166,Face Painting PDF Cloth doll tutorial. OOAK Cloth doll basic pdf tutorial. Step-by-step guide. Instant download.,"
            Cloth doll Face Painting tutorial. OOAK Cloth doll pdf  video tutorial. Step-by-step guide. Instant download.  English language.
The listing is for the electronic pdf instruction only - not for actual comleted doll or a disc.
About the doll: in this tutorial I work wit a doll about 21 inch (55 cm) tall. But everything in this tutorial is suitable for a doll of any size and almost every pattern.
The face is painted with acrilyc paints and dry pastel.
You will get the head E-pattern. It comes with easy to follow comprehensive step-by-step instructions.
This tutorial is available as instant download PDF book. After purchase you will instantly receive an e-mail from Etsy with a pdf-file, with all links. Etsy doesn't allow to download files over 20 Mb, so I have to give you the link in PDF-file.
The BASIC face painting tutorial contains 2 PDF files:
1. E-pattern of a doll's head.
2. PDF-tutorial. Face. 88 pages, 100 photos with text instructions, the face stencil.
*In this book I tell you everything about brushes, pastel and paints.
*We are learning face proportions. It is the most important knowledge for attractive doll face. 
*We use simple drawing scheme,  and you have to repeat  them in scetches for training.
*The process of face painting is shown in large pictures with detailed text instructions. 
*I show you the simple way to animate the face with pastel (look at the 3rd photo).
*Also we learn the more difficult way to animate doll's face with the help of acrylic paints (te 4th photo).
If you think that you have no talent, then you still do not know the simple laws and techniques of face painting. I'm sure, that everybody can draw a doll face!
SKILLEVEL - beginner. You need have some time and a lot of patience.
It took me several years to learn making beautiful dolls and especially painting faces. 
You can get all my experience now, to avoid many mistakes and disappointments, and learn making cute dolls for a couple of weeks! 
Look at the photo of my students 1st dolls! 
They thought that it's impossible to create such face after 1-2 weeks of learning. 
It's a big amount of information and the most comprehensive course you've ever seen!
If you decide to sell your creations I would really appreciate you credit me as the designer and provide a link to my Etsy shop.

The leather lariat is made with 100% real brown suede leather, with a copper focal point.  
This is not exactly like the necklace she wore but my own interpretation.
The necklace worn on the model is 16 inches long.  The bottom part of the lariat hangs down about 3"", neck measurement is 13"".
Item comes in cute cotton bag in a box.
Thank you for looking, enjoy your day.        ",24.00,4.9406,"Handmade item

16881,"Silver Mountain Ring, adjustable band sterling .925 travel adventure delicate mountains range hiking biking climbing gift for girlfriend","
            Be a bit adventurous with this sweet little silver mountain range ring.  Simple and very comfortable to wear, it makes a pretty and unique little gift or keep it for your own adventures and travels.
I now offer this popular design in shiny silver plated brass and brushed solid sterling silver.  Please look at the photos for the differences.
Each ring is gently adjustable to fit sizes 5-8.  This is a delicate ring and should not be continuously adjusted.  I recommend only adjusting it once to fit and treating it with care.
This ring does not come in a specific size but is adjustable to fit your finger.
Your ring will arrive in a lovely ring box with ribbon and ready to give as a gift. 
All materials are lead and nickel free.  
Please note--this ring may tarnish over time with exposure to air as with all silver products. It is recommended to refrain from bathing, swimming, and excessive hand washing with this ring to keep the finish nice and shiny and to keep it in a small plastic bag to reduce tarnishing.
Ships quickly from the mountains of North Carolina.
I have a necklace to match here:

17157,"Stackable Name Ring, dainty name ring, personalized ring with your word choice, mom ring, stacking ring","
            These dainty stacking rings are perfect for personalizing with your children's names, dates, or a meaning word of your choice.
Please set the quantity of rings you need from the drop down menu.
************************************************************
The rings are created from solid sterling silver or solid 14k yellow gold.  I use round wire to create the band, but forge a small section at the top flat.  It is on this flattened area that I stamp the word of your choice.  I am now offering 2 different size styles:
Teeny Tiny is about 1mm tall with a TINY 1mm lettering.  (Very tiny!!)
Little Bigger is about 1.5mm tall with a little 1.5mm lettering. 
The rings are TINY by design, with TINY lettering meant to be subtle.  This style of ring will only fit up to 10 character spaces.  Keep in mind that they make look large on your computer screen, but they are tiny :)
I do make several versions of posey rings, so if you need more than 10 character spaces or want a larger band or font, please look the other styles:  
http://www.etsy.com/shop/KathrynRiechert?section_id=5227703
The text is an all uppercase font.  Lowercase is not available.
Don't forget during checkout to tell me your ring size (I can do virtually any whole, half, or quarter sizes) and the word/words you would like on the ring. 
When will the custom ring(s) be made?  Click the 'Shipping and Policies' tab (under the photographs and at the top of the this description) for information on shipping times and my shop policies.
The rings are fabricated and will have a solder joint (a thin line or dot where the 2 ends of the ring come together).  I do not plate my rings.
**********************************************************
CUSTOM ORDERS PLEASE READ:
*I can also stamp numbers, a heart, and a plus sign.
*Custom messages can be a maximum of 10 characters spaces.  If you have a question about this, please just send me a message.  
*Please be sure of your ring size before ordering, I do charge a resizing fee (20) if the ring needs to be resized.
*If you are ordering a set of several rings, the sizes and messages can be different for each ring.
*These rings are stamped by hand, as such, letter placement will have a whimsical touch. This embodies the charm of a hand stamped piece and is not to be considered a flaw.
*This is a TINY ring with TINY lettering.  This is by design to make the message more private for the wearer, and to allow you to stack many rings.
*I cannot accept returns or exchanges on custom made rings.
*Did I mention they are TINY?  Please refer to a ruler to see if these are the rings for you.  If you'd like a larger size, please look in the custom section in my shop for larger rings :)
*The patina used to darken the gold rings is affected by hand sanitizers and alcohols.  (I use a different patina for silver rings, and the silver rings can withstand hand sanitizer and alcohols.)
TO ORDER A CUSTOM RING:
Please purchase a ring from this listing. At checkout write in the ‘notes to seller box’ your ring size and the message you would like.
Rings will be made exactly as written, so please check your spelling before submitting your order.  If you are ordering a set of several rings, the sizes and messages can be different for each ring, but please be clear about which size gets paired with which word/name.
For example:
size 6.5
message:  BFF
size 7.5
message:  LOVE
**********************************************************
Don't know your RING SIZE?
There are many sizing methods offered online, however, having your finger sized at a local jewelry store is the most accurate method.
If you need to convert a size from a non-US sizing system, this site is wonderful:

17703,Sheffield Snow Globe Necklace - Sheffield landmarks - Sheffield necklace - architecture - Yorkshire - skyline - snow globe jewellery,"
            Sheffield landmarks old and new adorn the glittery snow filled landscape of our Sheffield snow globe necklace, including the Crucible, Winter Gardens, and the fondly remembered looming chimneys of Tinsley Viaduct. 
We asked local Sheffield residents for their favourite buildings and landmarks to adorn this Yorkshire skyline. Can you identify their top picks?
From our illustrations we created a new view of Sheffield placing the iconic architecture together.   Our snow globe began as a series of drawings which we then combined digitally.  These are fed to Bertha, our laser cutter, who transferred their outlines onto FSC certified Birch wood.  We then hand painted each element using beautiful pearlescent mica-infused inks to make the city skyline pop.
Mixing 3 types of glitter to create the perfect snowy dew over the city gives our snow globes extra glisten and sparkle. 
The city is cut from FSC certified birch plywood and the Sheffield name plaque is cut from FSC certified solid cedar wood, with the globe itself cut from clear acrylic.
We'll post the globe to you in one of our wax sealed boxes, hand stamped by team Frilly.
Keep an eye out for our every growing collection of city snowglobe necklaces.  Our first, Birmingham, is shown in photo 4.

**^^@^^** About Gold-Filled **^^@^^**
All gold-filled jewelry sold by Virginia Wynne Designs is nickel free.  Gold-Filled looks, feels, and wears like gold because it actually has a solid layer of gold bonded to a base metal.  It is 100 times thicker than gold plate and will not flake or tarnish like gold plate.  It makes a great and cheap alternative to real gold and is great if you are sensitive to metals!

READ BELOW FOR ANSWERS TO COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS: 
◆Q: Can I add extra birthstones/or accent beads to a bracelet?

https://www.etsy.com/listing/80300824/add-a-swarovski-crystal-birthstone?ref=shop_home_feat
◆Q: Can you stamp something on the back of the pendant?
A: Sorry, but I can only stamp on one side of a pendant...otherwise I've found that the stamping runs the risk of showing through onto the front. Sorry about that.
Q: Can I include a note in the package so that I can send it directly as a gift?
A: Absolutely, it's no problem at all to include a short note for you in the package. Just type me a quick note during checkout of what you want the note to say.
Q: If I place an order today, how soon will my order ship? 
A: Always check the shop announcement at the top of my main page to see the current turn around times.
Q:What size is the pendant?
A: Check the sizing in the description of each piece of jewelry. Also, click on the arrows on the photos to see additional photos. 
Q: What are the hand-stamped pendants made out of?
A: My hand-stamped, quote pieces are made using brushed aluminum. Aluminum is very hypoallergenic and those that are even allergic to sterling silver and other metals can usually wear aluminum without any problems. 
Q: Can you make a custom necklace/custom quote for me?
A: I love custom orders! Convo me and let me know what you had in mind and I will see if it's something I can design for you. :)

            *SIZE UP. RUNS SMALL. (some go up two sizes.)*
20% of profits are donated to animal shelters! Right now I am primarily donating to an amazing shelter in Chicago called Felines and Canines. More than 7,000 has been donated at this point :) 
This is a Bella brand shirt, so it's very soft and comfortable. Runs small, so I would suggest sizing up. 
*pics belong to fashion bloggers @briebemis & @styledsnapshots - check them out on instagram!*
I am typically a 2-4 in dress size and prefer the medium. Some people suggest even going up 2 sizes, for me personally, I prefer just one.
For a complete size chart check out this site: http://wholesale.bella.com/bella/images/BC_Size_Charts.pdf
This style is considered ""womens slouchy."" That being said, size up.
*MENS/UNISEX sizing available upon request. Just send me an email or put it in the notes when you order :)

            Sheepskin Slippers
Handcrafted of genuine 100% sheepskin. These cuddly slippers look adorable and feel even better. Our sheepskin is always thick, dense and luxiouriously soft. Sheepskin slippers will keep your child's feet warm in the winter and cool in the summer.  The cuff folds up to wrap the ankle in warmth and make them easier to pull on.  Match them with the Baby and Children's Mittens for a great set!  These slippers are the perfect idea for a baby shower gift.
COLOR PICTURED: GOLD MISTY    (To view all the colors available visit our website:  www.thesheepherder.com and select ""Colors and Options"" from the Design Studio)
    
Sizes are a guideline only.  If you know the child's size order it even if it differs from the guideline. You know your child best!  Take into consideration the time of year you are ordering and when you will give them as a gift when determining size.  The slippers will get a bit bigger with wear as the wool packs down.
IMPORTANT NOTES:
◾Please be aware that sheepskin is a natural product and as a result, each hide may be slightly different in texture from the next.  You might see marks on your product.  These are not defects or blemishes.  They are just part of the natural hide and makes each piece unique.
◾Also keep in mind that each computer monitor and printer will show these colors a little differently.

This hand stamped fish key chain is a perfect gift for dad or grandpa!
Key chain includes ONE 1 1/4"" aluminum bobber shape stamped with whatever will fit. 
Your choice of copper (will tarnish) or aluminum (non-tarnish) fish hang from a silver or antique brass fish hook charm - choose from one up to six fish! Fish will hang in a bunch at the bottom of the hook when in use. 
NOTE: 
For the top section of the bobber I can fit up to 5 letters in the large lowercase typewriter style letters or up to 10 characters in an alternative tall and skinny font.
IMPORTANT: 
Copper fish will naturally tarnish and age to a dark finish over time just like a copper penny. Aluminum fish are lightweight and non-tarnish.
Everything hangs from a stainless steel key ring with a silver plated clip - perfect for attaching to a fishing vest or tackle bag!  Every keychain comes packaged with a tackle box card - ready for gift giving!
WHEN ORDERING: 
Please list the following information in the comments section when ordering:
1. Name(s) for fish
2. Name/Message for the Bobber if choosing the custom message option

PLEASE NOTE: I hand-stamp each number and letter one at a time on every piece I make. No two items will ever be exactly the same. Because of the technique I use, the letters and numbers will not line up precisely straight. This should not be considered a flaw but rather what makes your piece unique, one-of-a-kind and special. I use no machines, just my two hands, steel stamps and a hammer. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to message me before purchasing.

            Vintage Levi's brand shorts. These babes have been hand-cut, distressed and artfully frayed to perfection. 
These have a medium high waist that range from 11-13"" rise, they sit just above the hip bone, on most.
These are high waist, vintage 70s-90s in your custom size, favorite color, flattering cut and tatter choice. We get our customers(see reviews) a ""these were made for me"" fit when they provide their measurements.
Vintage Levi's brand shorts. These babes have been hand-cut, distressed and artfully frayed to perfection. 
These have a high waist and medium-high cut.
* Message us for sizing help
* THESE RUN SMALL
* These are custom-fit for you.
* NOTE Just remember that Levi's generally don't have stretch since they are 100% cotton denim. 
******* PLEASE FILL THIS OUT WITH YOUR ORDER: http://firegypsyvintage.com/pages/levis-shorts-size
* Please note these take 5-7 days to custom-fit then 2-3 days to ship.
* 501's are extra  a which are harder to find/more rare, button-fly, slimmer fit, thicker denim and more collectable.
(The 501 has a button fly front instead of the zipper, is has a slimmer fit and is good for less curvy body types. It is Levi's classic style since the 1800s.  
They are harder to find and more sought after they actually gain value with age and are now becoming collectable. The denim is a bit thicker. If you are purchasing these shorts for a trip or event and won't wear them much, I would suggest the regular Levi's. If you want to wear them alot and keep them for years, I would suggest the 501's.)

Please Measure yourself and base your purchase off of the actual measurements keeping in mind these are measurements taken lying flat.
The sizes are approximate and fit will vary depending on your height, body type and how curvy you are in the hip and bottom areas.
These come in small, medium and large and the sizes listed are just approximates based on feedback I receive.

20470,Pussyhat | Bulky Soft Yarn | Women's Rights Pink Pussy Hat,"
            **I am currently a few days ahead of schedule for shipping. We can only guarantee 2-3 week processing time, but it is likely to arrive sooner, I'm knitting as fast as I can! :) 
Don't worry about the seasons, this hat can be worn year round. I wore this exact hat for the women's march in St. Petersburg, FL. It was 80 degrees and I felt as empowered as ever! People will be wearing these awesome hats for the next four years at least! Get yours to continue to show solidarity! #girlpower
This is a one size fits all hat that is quite stretchy. I use extremely soft bulky yarn. The circumference can stretch up to 26 inches. If you have dreads or some other reason you need an XL, let me know, but it will fit a regularly large head, or a little kid due to its stretch.
