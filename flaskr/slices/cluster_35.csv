1156,Vintage Platinum Floral Pattern Art Deco Wedding Ring | Slender Band | Platinum Wedding Band | Platinum Stacking Ring | Art Deco Wedding,"
            A charming vintage wedding band crafted in platinum dating from about the Art Deco period. The piece features a lovely orange blossom or forget-me-knot floral pattern and is marked 100–Irid. 900 Plat for its platinum content. It's in nice vintage condition, commensurate with its age. **Please note that it must have been resized at one point, as the pattern on the band is interrupted in one section (roughly 8mm long), though this does not take away too much from the ring's beauty. You can this section a bit in the last photo. The ring is priced to reflect this. It is roughly 1.6mm wide and 1.1mm thick—on the slender side but sturdy. It's about a size 7.25 on our mandrel. (Please note that the box in the photos is for display purposes only; the rings in the third photo are sold separately.)

These measurements are approximate, and photos have been taken at close range to show details. We are not jewelers or gemologists, but we strive to describe the piece to the best of our abilities. Thank you for looking, and please review our policies prior to purchase.
All of our jewelry is pre-owned (or pre-loved as we like to say). These pieces, like all antique jewelry, should be handled with great care (especially moonstone, which is a softer stone, coming in at just a 6 on the Mohs scale) and not worn in the shower, pool, or when doing housework or exercising.

            This is a really cool OLD 1 lb. Sun-Glo powdered shuffleboard wax container from the early 1970s. It has never been opened. It has great color for such an old can.

It has cardboard sides, and a metal top and bottom. The top has 8 indentations to punch to open.  It measures 3"" diameter and 7"" tall. Plus, if you have a shuffleboard, you can use the contents and still have the neat old can to display with sports memorabilia!!!    #13

            This vintage 1995 Lionel train puzzle has 1500 pieces.  It features all kinds of train cars / engines and associated accessories.  The Springbok by Hallmark jigsaw puzzle, PZL9026, was given to my father-in-law, a lifelong train enthusiast, many years ago.  We got it back in their estate and enjoyed putting it together (as he did).  All pieces are there.
The box is in very good condition - lower right corner is sunk in a bit, and there is a bit of water damage on the back, but it doesn't go through to the inside.
Puzzle weighs in at just under 3 pounds.

            This Vintage SKIRT Linzner Alpine TRACHTEN is a charming piece of clothing in the traditional German - Austrian style (Trachten mode), with blue flowers pattern, which will pair well with a white blouse. It is airy and comfortable, a lovely choice for a summer stroll. The skirt is in excellent vintage condition. 
MATERIAL: 
Skirt: 100 % cotton 
Lining: 100 % polyester
SIZE of the skirt is approximately 46, corresponding to Large (L). 
The size is not visible on the tag. You can find the clothing sizes and size conversions in Europe here: http://goeurope.about.com/cs/shopping/l/bl_clothes_size.htm - just to have an idea, like they say on the page, size conversion isn't an exact science.
Approximate MEASUREMENTS (taken lying flat) are as follows: 
Length from waist to end of skirt: 82 cm - 32.3 inch
Waist: 42 (x2) cm - 16.5 (x2) inch - expandable a little bit to 44 cm (x2) - 17.3 inch

SHIPPING
I ship internationally. The shipping taxes specified here refer to priority mail. If you are interested in buying this item, please take a moment to read in detail the Policy of my shop. The shipping amounts specified below are the fees of our Postal Service - as they are very high I haven't included any of the handling costs in the shipping price. Upon request, I can provide the buyer with a copy of the receipt for the shipping fee. 
COMBINED SHIPPING - If you're considering buying more than one item, should your purchase fit into one package weighing less than 1 kilogram then the second item could have zero shipping costs. After the package is shipped I will notify you with the exact shipping cost (upon request, I can send a scan of the receipt), and will refund any extra amount of money paid by you at the moment of purchase.
Also, please be sure to check with your local customs for any extra duties or restrictions that may apply to the purchase of vintage clothes. I have no way of knowing the duties or restrictions for every country (for example, the US may have an annual quota for import of textiles), and so I cannot be held responsible if for any reason the buyer should encounter problems with the package at their customs. I can put the item on Reserve until all those details are known (exact shipping cost and local customs info), so there will be no hurry - what is important is that both seller and buyer know exactly what to expect when purchasing an item, and do all that is necessary so that the item will arrive safely to its new owner.
Feel free to message me with any questions, I will be glad to answer all.

            This listing is for one yard (36 inches or 91.33cm) of fabric. There are multiple yards available. If more than one yard is purchased then you will receive the entire yardage as one complete length.
*measurement increments on rulers in the pictures are in INCHES*
This autumnal fabric is new, old stock and would make an amazing quilt, pillow case or home decor item. It is in perfect shape. This fabric has not been laundered.
This wool blend fabric has a woven pattern of black grasses over a blue background.  The background color is actually made of black and light blue threads so that the overall color appears to be a dark denim blue color.  Please refer to the last photo for the best representation of the color. Crayola brand crayons were placed in the photo for a color comparison.
This fabric has a slight sheen and a wonderful texture created from course weave and the wool slubbing. The drape is stiff and has slightly rough texture.
Fabric specifics:
-Fabric is 14.5 inches (36.8 cm) wide.
- Medium weight
-95% wool, 5%nylon
-Little to no stretch
*I am always willing to provide more information or pictures regarding my fabrics or using/sewing these fabrics. Please do not hesitate to send me a convo if you have any questions.*
I believe that the pictures show a good representation of the fabric colors however, please remember that colors may look different on your monitor.

            Star Wars Ubrickkian Landspeeder 9000 Z001....
Driving through the streets of Mos Eisley in your new landspeeder, you decide to take a break and have a few drinks.  In the parking lot of the Cantina, you see a gleaming Ubrickkian Landspeeder. Mezmerized, you walk up to it.  The bright white cooliant paint glints in the sunlight.  You peer in through one of the windows.  Plush leather upholstery covers the entire interior.  You notice the keys had been left in the ignition.  You try the door.  It swings open.  Would anyone really notice if it dissapeared for a few days (or weeks)?  Probably not.  You hop in and take off.  Two seconds later, you notice a Stormtrooper Patrol Speeder right behind you, the persuit lights flashing brightly.  Drat..
Add this original blueprint to your collection - frame it or leave it as is.  The blueprint would also be great as gift wrap paper for the die-hard Star Wars fan, or you could even use it for altered art or mixed media projects.  Be creative!

Although Switzerland was neutral during the war, the Swiss Army remained active and was in alert to be ready to protect the country. This beltbag is a silent witness of these turbulent times.
It is from 1937, marked with the date and the maker's mark: ""S. Fäh, Sattler, BENKEN"". The Swiss cross is also punched to the back panel. 
The ammo-bag measures 7.3"" x 3.7"" x 1.6"" / 18.5cm x 9.5cm x 4cm.
The inner size of one compartment is 3.3"" x 3.3"" x 1.2"" (8.5 x 8.5 x 3cm).
It is in nice vintage condition without damages. It has a warm dark brown color and nice patina. Some scratches and signs of wear are results of the 80 years and the war times. 
It is intact and fully functional, ready to be used. Please see the photos to judge the condition of this wartime piece.

            This is a gorgeous and dramatic, 1920's, Egyptian Assuit shawl with fringe.  These shawls are sometimes referred to as tullebi-talli, which when translated means"" net with plating"".  These tiny silver plated pieces are woven in and out of the netting and then hammered into place.  I imagine it would be a very time-consuming piece to complete.  This one is in near mint condition with only minimal tarnishing in a couple of areas.  It measures 88"" by 35"", excluding the 4"" black silk fringe.  This impressive shawl weighs close to five pounds and is almost entirely covered with tiny silver plated pieces.        ","2,075.00",5.0,"Vintage item from the 1920s

About Persol: 
Founded in 1917 by Giuseppe Ratti, Persol is an Italian eyewear company. The name is derived from “per il sole,” which means “for the sun” in Italian. The company originally catered to pilots and sports car drivers with the line’s sports wear focus and durability. Persol was introduced to the States in 1962. Early on, the brand was popularized by Steve McQueen and, later, Don Johnson and Tom Cruise, to name a few of the many celebrities who have sported Persol.

5277,"Brass Rubbing - 1641 Penn, Buckinghamshire","
            The charming brass, much sought after by enthusiasts, show the children of John and Sarah Penn. The family were cousins of the famous Quaker, William Penn (1644 -1718) who founded Pennsylvania. The charm of these brasses lies in the way the engraver shows each child as a separate entity. The five daughters wear simple clothes with broad falling collars and vadycked bodices. They are all shown in different poses-in marked contrast to the engraved effigies of the 15th and 16th centuries.

            All natural (no waxes or dyes) hemp net for hermit crabs, reptiles, or anything that enjoys climbing. Great for putting dry hiawatha moss or sheet moss in for your crabs to dig into. I also like to put their changing shells in it to keep them from getting sandy. Net holes are ideal for placing green leafy vegetables or flowers in to encourage foraging. The net is safe for them to munch on as well. This net measures 12 inches by 9 inches. Extra twine for hanging will be included. The nets and ladders in the aquarium photos are demonstrative and not necessarily the same size as the listed item. If you have specific measurements let me know and I can give you a quote. I have various ladders and hammock sizes/shapes in my shop as well. Thanks for looking!

6144,Mini Catnip Sampler Organic Catnip and Catnip Pellets,"
            This listing is for a sampler of the catnip we use in our handmade toys.
You will receive 2 kinds of catnip each in a 6"" x 3.75"" heat sealed and later resealable bag. 
One bag contains 3.0 oz of our super clean compressed catnip pellets and the other has 0.3 oz (about 1/2 cup) of the best, most potent and delicious smelling loose dried and cut certified organic catnip leaves and flowers.  
In the photo of the 4 bags of catnip, the mini set is on the right. 
The larger bulk set can be found here:
http://www.etsy.com/listing/96633025/bulk-catnip-2-kinds-organic-loose-and
The dried leaf and flower catnip is certified organic and is a product of the USA.  Freshness makes a big difference when it comes to catnip and ours is much fresher than the catnip at the pet store so that your cat will get the maximum enjoyment and fun when you sprinkle it onto his scratching post or use it to freshen up refillable catnip toys. 
The compressed catnip pellets are a product of Canada where high quality catnip is compressed to make clean pellets.  Because the catnip is pelletized, it will last much longer than traditional leaf catnip! The pellets are perfect for refreshing refillable toys and also add a nice heft to traditional catnip pouch toys.  Catnip pellets can also be given to cats as an edible treat!
We package each kind of catnip into heat sealed bags so that all air is kept out and so that the catnip stays fresh and potent.  Once you open the packages, you can simply zip them closed to keep the catnip fresh.
We use this same super potent catnip to fill the toys we sell and here's what some of our clients have said about the catnip:
""The mail comes through a slot in our door and by the time I got home from work my cat had already made his way through the envelope, the pretty wrapping and started chewing through the box to get to these lovely little catnip peeps! I decided to go ahead and give him one and he has not stopped playing with it since.""
""My cats absolutely go bonkers for these!!""
""Wow -- Gus (our pride and joy) LOVED your medicated treats! He's normally only so-so with cat-nip...""
We are located in the San Francisco Bay Area and this item will usually ship First Class. All items are ready to ship unless otherwise noted. If you need more than what we have listed, please convo me to discuss bulk or wholesale orders.

            Dog paws need extra attention, too! Since dogs walk on hot pavement or snow and ice, their paw pads can get dry and cracked, or worse, blistered. Our Finley got a blister on one paw after playing basketball with our son. He was limping and in need of soothing help. We decided then that a Paw Fixer was definitely necessary! 
It actually came in handy later for a scratch on Finley's nose. Another dog got a little excited, and Finley got a scratch. We rubbed Paw Fixer on it a couple of days and it was gone! It heals paws and boo-boos!
We began with shea butter for its healing properties and conditioning emollients. We added avocado oil for its soothing and regenerative ability, sweet almond oil for its healing and moisturizing, and coconut oil for the antioxidant and anti-bacterial benefits. Our Paw Fixer created just the fix Finley needed. This balm is offered unscented, lavender, or lavender cedarwood.
Rub a pea sized amount onto paws to moisturize and condition.  Please remember that with a balm a little goes a long way!

6315,KLIBAN Cat fabric POWERFUL Organic Catnip Toys ~ Set of 2 !,"
            Everyone loves the Kliban Cat !  
 I am offering a set of 2 Kliban cat pillow toys handmade by me.     The  Kiss a Cat pillow measures 5 x 4 inches, and the super kitty measures about  14 x 5 inches. The back is a thick fleece.  
These are filled with the best organic catnip I have ever found ! 
Catnip Leaf is in fact not a medicinal herb but a narcotic. Felines have a sense of smell that is far more developed that that of humans - by a magnitude of several million. In fact, it has been suggested that felines perceive scent in the same way that humans perceive color. Just as certain wildcrafted herbs can cause humans to have visual hallucinations, so too does catnip leaf cause your tabby to experience olfactory hallucinations - which, if the typical cat response is any indication, are highly pleasurable, but ultimately harmless.  
If you live with a cat (or more than one), you'll want to buy these catnip toys to keep your kitties entertained. In fact, this natural herb, when given to your cat, is more likely to keep YOU entertained.        ",10.00,4.9917,"Handmade item

Why did the chicken cross the road?
Ralph Waldo Emerson: 
 It didnt cross the road; it transcended it.
Freud: 
 The fact that you thought that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.
Grandpa: 
 In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken had crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.
Jackie Mason: 
 Whaddaya want, it should just stand there?
Dr. Seuss: 
 Did the chicken cross the road? 
 Did he cross it with a toad? 
 Yes the chicken crossed the road, 
 but why he crossed, Ive not been told!
Sherlock Holmes: 
 Do not concern yourself with the chicken that did cross the road; the answer lies with the chicken that did not cross the road.
Darwin: 
 Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally selected in such a way that they are now genetically predisposed to cross roads
The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
 And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken, ""Thou shalt cross the road."" And the Chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.
James Dean: 
Because it was chicken.
Richard Nixon: 
The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did NOT cross the road.
Martin Luther King: 
It had a dream.
Bill Clinton: 
I did not cross the road with that chicken.

6681,8 - 10 ft cotton cord cover - asst colors available,"
            By special request...this listing is for a 8-10 ft length cord cover.
They are made in my smoke free/pet free home of NEW cotton or cotton blend material. I make them in all lengths and colors, but this listing is for the MEDIUM 8-10 ft. length. Remember, your cord cover should be at least twice the length of your cord to allow for more ""scrunch"". This is what makes them attractive. They are great for deterring pets and infants from chewing on cords!!
My cord covers are open ended WITHOUT velcro or elastic. (Personal preference). 
The colors I have currently available are:
1) Bright White
2) Off white/Ivory/Cream
3) Black
4) Brown, (dark brown, taupe, khaki)
5) Red (Christmas red or burgandy)
6) Orange or (peach)
7) Blue (turquoise, baby blue, royal blue or navy blue)
8) Yellow 
9) Green (olive, mint, lime green, Christmas green, teal)
10) Pink (hot pink, pale baby pink, mauve)
11) Purple (or lavender)
12) Gold (Harvest)
13) Gray (light, medium or dark)
14) Natural (an ""earthy textured"" off white with brown flecks)
After purchasing, please just message me your color request so I will know exactly what to ship.
I can create other color cord covers upon special request. Disclaimer: Although your cord cover will always be the color you choose, it may vary slightly in shade. Sometimes the fabric that I've been using will be discontinued or the ""dye lot"" will vary. If you are a repeat customer and purchasing the same color more than once, you need to be aware that the shade may vary slightly.
Quantity SPECIAL: purchase FOUR cord covers in one order -the FIFTH is FREE!(just be sure to message me if you want your fifth FREE one to be a different color from the rest).  Shipping is just 3.00 no matter how many cord covers you order!        ",10.00,4.9688,"Handmade item

As shown in the pictures the fish measures about 1 inch in length and it is a little over 1/2 inch in width. A hole will be drilled in the top middle where a silver split ring will be attached to another slightly larger one to be used for collar attachment(the split ring attaches to most collars). Once stamping is completed a jewelry wax is applied to seal the piece.

CUSTOMER REVIEWS:
This item is the Sandalwood Oil you obtain from Government run shops like Cauvery Emporium in Mysore. There are many adulterated Sandalwood oils on the market, and this is NOT one of them. This is pure Sandalwood Oil from India. It arrived on time from the seller, Divya, who is pleasant to deal with and answers your questions promptly. You may buy with complete trust from her.
******************************************************************************************************
Very impressed with the Sandalwood Oil. It's so hard to find, I was just delighted that it arrived quickly, and even included the most wonderful gift. Thanks so much! I highly recommend!!!
******************************************************************************************************
This is the best Sandalwood that I've purchased. Very extraordinary sandalwood.
******************************************************************************************************
The oil has a woody, exotic smell, subtle and lingering scent and the color is pale yellow  gold.
The essential oil of sandalwood is extracted through steam distillation of pieces of wood from matured Sandalwood trees which are 40-80 years old. The older the tree, the more oil is available, and the aroma is stronger.
Uses of sandalwood essential oil
This relaxing oil has a harmonizing and calming effect which reduces tension and confusion and is ideal for use in depression, hectic daily lifestyles and states of fear, stress, nervous exhaustion, chronic illness and anxiety.
It is very useful for any chest complaints as it has a pronounced effect on the mucus membranes of both the pulmonary as well as genito-urinary tract - making it very effective for complaints of the urinary tract as well.
Chronic chest infections, sore throats and dry coughs as well as bronchitis and asthma can benefit greatly from this oil, as well as cystitis and bladder infections, also helpful with sexual problems such as frigidity and impotence.
On the skin, sandalwood oil relieves itching and inflammation of the skin, and is most effective in relieving dehydrated skin - making it great for anti-ageing skincare - and the astringent action has a great toning effect and is also used with great results in oily skin conditions and to prevent the skin from forming ugly scars and for fighting dry eczema.
Mix with carrier oil for massages & body creams & lotions.

8288,Cedarwood & Patchouli Deodorant - Organic Deodorant - All Natural Deodorant,"
            Still using your favorite store-bought, antiperspirant deodorant? Perhaps it's time to think about ditching it. 
Because it most likely contains a host of harmful ingredients, like aluminum, which has been linked to breast cancer, Alzheimer's, bone disorders, and kidney problems, ""fragrance"", which is a term typically used to mask a chemical cocktail of synthetic scents that can wreak havoc on your endocrine system, sodium laurel sulfate (SLS), a known carcinogen, parabens, which have also been linked to breast cancer and are known endocrine disruptors, and a whole slew of other ingredients that you probably can't even pronounce and do God only knows what to your body. 
Plus, sweating is GOOD for you. It's how the body rids itself of toxins and cools itself down. But what's that? You'd really rather not get a whiff of what smells like an onion that's been left out in the sun all day every time you lift your arms? 
Fear not, my friend. There's a way to combat the pesky pit bacteria that creates that odor. This recipe contains: 
- Organic Coconut Oil: saturated fats in the form of medium chain triglycerides make coconut oil a rich moisturizer. Add in antimicrobial properties, naturally occurring proteins, vitamin E (a known antioxidant), and a host of beneficial fatty acids and coconut oil's reputation as a use-for-everything oil begins to make sense. 
- Organic Arrowroot Starch: a much better thickening agent than cornstarch, because its organic, gmo-free, and minimally processed. 
- Organic Mango Butter: a harder butter than shea or cocoa, and with a higher melting point, this fatty-acid rich butter is a wonderful moisturizer. 
- Beeswax: a thickening, stabilizing additive that lends some hardiness to the product. 
- Baking Soda: prevents fungal growth and fights odor. 
- Organic Patchouli Essential Oil: known for its disinfecting, antifungal, antiseptic, and deodorizing properties, this essential oil is a powerhouse when it comes to combating underarm odor. 
- Organic Cedarwood (Virginia) Essential Oil: this oil not only blends well with (and, let's face it, tones down) patchouli, but because of its own astringent and fungicidal properties, it works in tandem with the patchouli oil to keep you smelling like you just strolled out of a forest. In a GOOD way. 
If you're looking for a different scent combination, we also offer:

Packaged in a recycled, recyclable paperboard tube with a compostable label and shipped in recycled, recyclable materials so you can feel good about what's inside AND outside your product. 
**A FEW NOTES**
- This is an all-natural product made with sterilized equipment and no natural or chemical preservatives. For best results, store in a cool, dark place and use within six months of purchase. Make sure to leave the deodorant tightly capped between uses, and use on clean, dry armpits, as adding dirt or water to any preservative-free product could introduce some yucky bacteria into the mix. 
PRO TIP: if a natural product looks or smells off, discontinue use. 
*For external use only. Keep out of reach of children. Discontinue use if irritation occurs. This information has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.        ",10.00,4.7554,"Handmade item

8882,"OLD BOOKS Perfume Oil - Vanilla, Aromatic Woods, Leather, More - Choose From Four Sizes!","
            When I was still a hobbyist perfumer, I worked in an old bookshop. More often than not, as soon as a customer walked through the door, they would take a deep breath and comment on the shop's wonderful aroma. The soft vanilla base, the woodsy heart, and a dry, smoky hint of leather in the scent of old books contain the magic to evoke memories of limitless stories and fairy tale endings.
The ghosts of aging wood pulp and the ripening binding materials of the books would slowly float into my clothes and hair during the day. Every evening when I returned home, my husband would pull me close and tell me how I smelled as lovely as a library. It was then that I knew I wanted to capture that fragrance in a bottle
OLD BOOKS was born, and it is now the signature scent of my Literary Classics Perfume Collection. 
This perfume contains only pure, organic essential oils in a carrier of organic rice bran oil. It is 100% vegan, carefully crafted by hand, and it arrives in an amber glass bottle.        ",10.00,4.848,"Handmade item

8957,Vegan  Sugar Wax | All Natural Wax Hair removal | Sugaring Wax Kit | Organic | Sticks Included,"
            Remove your unwanted hairs the natural and organic way.
Sugaring has been around for hundreds of years as an effective and almost pain free hair removal treatment. It is made with only Nature’s ingredients and has no additives, colors, or fragrances. 
Sugaring can be done in AND out of the shower, and there is no need for extra supplies (simply use the sticks provided or your hands!)
Some benefits include:
-	All natural ingredients
-	Made to order—ALWAYS!
-	Slower and thinner hair growth
-	Smoother skin
-	No ingrown hairs!
Simply reheat the wax in 10 second increments, apply in direction opposite of growth at a malleable temperature, and pull away.
************************************************************************************
Occasionally, clients may experience inflammation after waxing. It can be from small and itchy bumps, to mosquito-bite-like welts. The hives only last a brief time, an hour at most. 
This is called a histamine reaction. The body is reacting to the hairs being pulled out and perceiving the hair removal as a threat. The immune system springs into action producing histamine to fight the threat, like an allergic reaction. 
To calm inflammation, follow up with a skin soother like aloe vera, rose water, or salt water. The inflammation should only last an hour or two before it is completely gone.

9183,Begleri Worry Beads Black Paracord Skill Toy Fidget Toy Stress Toy,"
            **With marbles this set weighs .66 ounces or 19 grams. With steel bearings this set weighs 1.17 ounces or 33 grams. Which one you choose is totally up to you. I've heard that heavier is easier to learn for newcomers since it doesn't spin around as fast and you have more control and momentum when it gets going. I personally use marbles in mine, but that may be because i'm an expert and like the speed and lightness.**
You'll receive 1 handmade black paracord begleri. Be sure to tell me how long you want the cord in between the beads in the length portion. Look at the last photo. You'll see that the length of my fingers together is 3 inches. For short game, measure yours and add 1.5 inches. For long game, add 3 inches to what you get. That's how I personally measure. Some already have their own way. Long game is definitely more versatile when it comes to tricks, while short game is easier to learn and the beads clack more. Searching YouTube for 'begleri tricks' will yield more long game tricks being found.
About Begleri
Begleri also known as worry beads, are used for relaxation, passing of time, and just overall enjoyment. They originated in Greece where cab drivers would flip them to limit smoking, and pass time while waiting on customers. For me they really do ease a worried mind.

PSC Partners Seeking A Cure is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation, whose mission is to provide education and support to PSC patients, families and caregivers and to raise funds to research causes, treatments and cures for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.  This disease causes the bile ducts, inside and outside the liver, to become scarred, narrowed and eventually blocked.  As more ducts are blocked, bile becomes trapped in the liver, causing damage.  If left unchecked, liver cell death can result, leading to cirrhosis and the possibility of a liver transplant.  A friend received a PSC diagnosis in 2011, and this organization has been a huge asset for her and her family since that time.  More information about PSC Partners Seeking A Cure and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis can be found at the organization’s website, http://www.pscpartners.org.

10347,"Medium Beach Balls, Fabric beach ball, first  birthday gift, baby shower gift, Easter gift, rattle toy","
            Gorgeous, colorful fabric beach balls are a fun and versatile toy for children of all ages. These are soft and easy to grip for young babies' exploratory play. Great for indoor play for older children learning to throw and catch. Ideal for dodge ball or indoor soccer. They are very soft and lightweight which would make injury or property damage extremely unlikely when these are tossed around by your rambunctious bunch. Each ball has a jingle bell inside which functions as a rattle for babies and gives warning of oncoming danger in a dodgeball game. My husband and I have had a ton of fun tossing these around with our one year old. He loves learning to throw and catch and kick and chase the balls all over the house. The fun colors and patterns are just a bonus in this great toy!
The large ball is approximately 21"" around - similar in size to a junior soccer ball.
The medium ball is 16"" around. 
The small measures 12"" around - a little larger than a soft ball.        ",10.00,5.0,"Handmade item

            What if creating beauty and living from your passion became your daily reality? What would you be feeling? How would it affect your life? How would the fact of you successfully and fruitfully following your dream affect the lives of your loved ones?
I am truly convinced there is one key difference between successful and less successful artists, crafters and designers, and it is not their artistic talents, nor their ability to take perfect photos or master their tags and titles, even though these are of course important too. What really distinguishes the two is the level of belief and self-confidence that the successful sellers had about themselves even before they became successful. I believe the sellers you look up to often had their success guaranteed even before they actually opened their stores. Why? Because they believed they would be successful. And when they did, the whole world had no choice but to believe it too.
I have written this ebook because I have been where you are. I had my weeks of doubt and anxiety that all the work I have put in creating my artist dream was just a waste of time. But then I decided to change my thinking and once I did, everything else changed too. I want to share with you what I have learned in the process. This ebook has two purposes only: reminding you that you are capable of achieving anything you desire and showing you in practice how to do it through changing your attitude.

Some reviews from my lovely readers:
""I read the book yesterday and I can honestly say it is a gem of a book. I believe that it will be a great guide and tool for those looking to create success for themselves. You take some truths that are timeless and put them in a great format. I love the way you give an overview and then break it down, piece by piece with a personal touch. You have given a personal look into the how and why, and that's what makes your guide unique. It may be a new premise for some but I think that you have brought it to them in a ""don't sweat the small stuff"" way. You show them how to open up to the fun side of creating and being prosperous; to use their minds as they were meant to be used. I've read about this before and have experienced it myself to some extent - I ""forget"" to practice it. Your book is concise and yet full of words to help me stay on track. 
Great read!!! I would recommended it to all who are looking for success, no matter what that means to each one.""
""I read your ebook twice! First of all I love all the inspirational quotes in between the lines!
I think what you say is really true, in the end, after everyting possible is done and still nothing sells, it comes down to believing in your art and self! This is my biggest hurdle and your ebook really reflected it to me (...) Very inspring and I probably will read it again, just to remind myself of all the good tools you show.""

            ""The Ghost Orb Light"" Pro-pack Silkscreen Sleeve CD
Official Track Listing:
1. My Presence, Here Resonates..Eternal (Intro)
2. Beyond Twilight
3. Trance to the Spinning Blades
4. Pneumonia
5. Our Days (A Reflection..A Memory)
6. Ghost in a lonely Realm
7. Dried Pills of Lassitude
8. Mania of the Poltergeist
(Release Date: November 2008)
--Self-Released
--Description: ""The Ghost Orb Light"", is a full-length demo-album from compilations of all our oldest music we've made from our past sessions of writing and composing that we've decided to form into a musical album. With various combinations of style and sounds, a mostly dark acoustic ambient set. Operatic ghost chantings, clean vocals, to tortured muttered harsh screams and cries, held together with soft whispers of a cold night Siren; from the hypnotic atmospheric echoes that entice you with vibrant high octaves meshed into a type of somber glossy synchronization. Gripping you into the isolated walls of an amnesiac, to a faint baby crying somewhere in an antique Room with a random banjo playing chords to a person who just overdosed in a Hospital Bedroom. Faltering the continuous cycles of a depraved poltergeist wandering itself within its unknowingly prison in search to resolve the compensation of his or her own past life.
The Woman in the Attic Room calls out to the Spirits at night, as these restless Hauntings in the darkened depths of shadows around her every corner unveil slowly. From Realms beyond our own; they find a new place to dwell inside and all around the listeners ears. Conjuring ghost orbs in the Lantern. One by one, as each tells a story. Neurotic Carousel's ""The Ghost Orb Light"", guarantees to throw you into a trance-like dream state. One in which you cannot so easily pull away or escape from.

10647,Mike Heaphy and Infinite Heart Original music CD 12 Songs,"
            I made this CD of original music ~12 original tunes I would describe as Folk Rock. My band and I always received a great response when we performed them live so we decided put them on a CD. This CD was recorded with many of my best friends over the course of the summer of '95 and we had a blast doing it.
 It was recorded by Hank Bones of Bones Tones Studios in Brooklyn, New York, with one live track recorded in Oslo, Norway. It is our hope that you will like listening to these songs as much as I liked writing and recording them. Here is a link to videos of two of the songs on the album so you can get an idea of the content.

11412,Book Art Apple,"
            I recycle, upcycle and re-purpose old books destined for the land-fill.  I try to pick out books with natural foxing (or tanning of the pages). The outside is inked with a bright red ink. I add a twig from the backyard for the stem and also a few leaves for a realistic look.
This would make a nice teacher's gift or a gift for any book lover. You may want one for yourself... to set on a bookshelf or desk.  Also, the apple would be a wonderful gift for the Jewish community in celebration of the Jewish New Year.
You may not get the one pictured, but I do use the same pattern for all the apples. There may be a slight difference in the size and color of the pages.
.
The apple in the first two pictures are what people fall in love with, so I've left those pictures in, but, in reality, the last three are more representative of how I now make my apples. However, if you like the leaves in the first pictures, I can accommodate you.
The apple measures approximately:  5.5"" H x 7"" W; with about a 20"" circumference

11495,Sale--Speech Therapy Stimuli Book for Childhood Speech Disorders,"
            Speech Therapy Stimuli Book for Childhood Speech Disorders
This resource developed for speech-language pathologists and parents gives careful attention to sound and word selection and is presented in an engaging picture format.   This publication incorporates many words considered part of a core vocabulary, which is described as “a small set of basic words in any language that are used frequently and across contexts” (Cross, et al., 1997).  Targeting core vocabulary words helps children to be better understood by others.
The words have been selected carefully to represent a core vocabulary as well as the opportunity to incorporate the following goals:
•	Vowel differentiation/ accuracy 
•	Target voicing errors
•	Sequencing sounds with increasing complexity in one, two, and three syllable words
•	Building intraoral air pressure 
•	Sound placement
•	Developmental acquisition- incorporating “early 8” and “middle 8” sounds  (Shriberg, 1993)
•	Prosody and coarticulation
•	Vocabulary - many first words; high-frequency words
•	Narrative skills- story-based pictures
This book is a useful tool to use in therapy and home practice as part of a treatment program for children with speech sound disorders such as children with hearing loss, childhood apraxia of speech, cleft palate, dysarthria, and phonological impairments.
The book is approximately 22 pages and spiral bound.

12274,Custom WEDDING CHARM photo memory soldered glass personalized charms reversible with your 2 pictures or images toss bouquet boutonniere,"
            This is a listing for ONE custom silver memory charm that I will make to order for you! Have a favorite picture of a loved one, pet, friend, or saying? This adorable charm measures approximately 1"" square, and features a reversible design. You will email me one or 2 photos of your choosing and I will custom make the item for you! These are not those cheesy glue on commercial style frames. All is sandwiched together between two pieces of glass, sealed inside and soldered with lead-fr*ee silver solder. I can make your photo as is color or even change it to sepia or black & white. I will shrink it and crop it for you to fit the pendant. Want one side to have a special sentiment...I can do that too! I am pretty flexible with the design...so let me know what you want and we will work it out! Possibilities are ENDLESS! This will be beautiful hanging from your bouquet or for a toss bouquet, and will last as a momento for years to come!  Need a different quantity?  The listing is for one, but I can make any number you need, just add the quantity to your cart. PLEASE READ THE FAQ SECTION BELOW TO ANSWER THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS!!!! :)
Makes a wonderful gift! Don't forget to get one for the groom's boutonniere too!
These generally take about a week or less to ship once the photos have been proofed.  
The photo shows what your charms may look like when hung on your own ribbon. Yours comes with just the charms ordered.
Email images to  tstept2 [!at] aol.com or attach to a convo.  THANKS!
------------------------
FAQ:
------------------------
1. How long will they take before I get my charms?
Once photos are proofed, I have them ready to ship in about a week or less usually.  During busy holiday seasons, it can be up to 3 weeks.  I do my very best to get them out as quick as humanly possible, and please let me know if you have special time constraints, so we can upgrade to faster shipping, etc.  
2.  Where do I send my photos? 
Please email the photos in their original uncropped form to  tstept2 [!at] aol.com or attach to an etsy convo, and I will crop, edit, resize and email back a proof for you in color, b&w and sepia.  
3.  How big do photos need to be?
Atleast 1"" in size, the larger the better!
4.  What goes on the backside?
Anything you wish!  I can place the same photo, another photo, a word, a text, initial, date, a pretty print I can create, you name it!  Let me know what you wish to have, and I can create it for you!
5.  Can I mail photos instead?
Nope.  I really prefer scanned images, as it is really scary to mail precious photos, and I cannot be responsible for the post office.  I would HATE for your photos to be lost!  Scanning pics is best...or even a friend or coworker, or copy shop can scan them.  I have even created these with pictures of photos!  :)
6.  Can I get the blank charm to add my own photo?
These are not commercially made pop on charms.  I create these from scratch right around your photos, so sadly it is not possible.  I cannot ship without the photos.  
7.  I need my charm within a REALLY tight timeframe, like a week or less...is this possible?
YES!!!  I do offer rush processing, which is a 10 fee per item, and I have it ready to ship in about 24 hours from the okay of the photo proof.  You may still want to upgrade to priority or express, but I only charge exact shipping, so US priority is 5.50 to anywhere in the US, and express next day is 18.50.  I do it all the time, and if we act fast, you will have your very special charm right on time for the big day :)  I have a separate listing in my shop for RUSH charms.
8.  I am worried my photo may not work, should I send it prior to ordering?
Nope.   Please do not send pics until you place the order.  I do not do any photo editing etc until you place the order.  I have not turned a photo away in over a decade of creating these, so rest assured, I will make it work :)        ",10.00,4.9696,"Handmade item

            Threepence's have always been linked to superstition, spiritualism and luck.

This threepence is from 1900, just at the end of Victoria's reign and is very delicate and detailed.

**This set Includes keepsake and toss garter**
*****Details*****
Please make sure your measurement is exact. Do not add or take off extra inches to make sure your garter fits.  All garters are made smaller then the actual size for a snug fit. All you have to do is provide us your exact measurement/size. 
The keepsake garter is hand embellished with a rhinestones and pearls and center with a blue rhinestone., The matching toss garter is embellished with a simple yet elegant bow and blue rhinestone jewel surrounded by elegant rhinestones. 
The center of both the keepsake and toss garter is adorned with an elegant blue jewel--for the ""something blue""!
Quality is our number one goal so we use high quality, soft stretch lace for both the keepsake and toss garters. 
The 'garter box' option available upon checkout is a custom fit, kraft colored jewellery box. It is the perfect size to keep your garter safe until the big day! It is not a keepsake box which are at least 10 times the cost. Those will be available soon!
*****Details*****
To better the quality of our products, we have recently switched our ivory and white stretch lace to a higher end product. All keepsake and toss garters will be made using the same width lace to avoid color or style conflict. 
Lace details:
Different lace lengths are available through the selection drop down!
The Keepsake lace measures approximately 1.5” (inches, as pictured) - 2.25"" (inches) wide depending on the color. All toss garter lace measures approximately 1” (inches) wide. 
***Please include the following in the ‘Note to Sellers’ box at checkout***
1.	Thigh Measurements – see below.
2.	Wedding date. We work towards your wedding date to ensure you receive your products on time. 
Custom Orders:
I welcome your creativity! Please message me for custom orders and I will be happy to accommodate.
Measurements (**Please ensure to measure while standing up**):
Select your thigh measurements in the dropdown box at checkout. To measure your thigh, place a soft measuring tape 4-5” (inches) above knee or as desired.  Alternatively, you can use a piece of string, make the measurement and place that string against a ruler to get your measurement. I need this exact measurement. It is very important the measurement is done standing up to ensure maximum accuracy. Please do not take off or add anything extra, I will take in the appropriate amount to ensure a comfortable and secure fit. The toss garter will be made according to the same measurements as the keepsake.

12708,"Dried Flower confetti, Flower girl, Wedding table decor, Tossing Flowers, Petal Confetti, 2 cups","
            2 cups of amazingly assorted dried and dehydrated flowers. 
The colors of these flowers are crisp and bright. 
The flowers included are:
Pansy- giant majestic and crown varieties
Dianthus, purples and pinks
Viola in assorted colors
Cyclamen- pink, red and white
Marigolds- orange, yellow and flame
Roses- yellow, pink, white, red, coral
Bougainville- coral, purple, pink and white
Salvia- blue and purple
Whirling Butterfly- creamy white
Justicia- orange
Almond Verbena- white
Artemisia- yellow clusters and leaves are silver
Turks Cap- redish purple
Camellia petals- red and pink
Snap dragons- yellow, orange, pink and burgundy 
Gomfrenia- pink
These are for decoration only and not fit for human consumption. 
A basic guideline for amounts to use:
1/3 to 1 cup for each person tossing at bride and groom
3 to 6 cups for flower girl baskets depending on basket size
2 to 3 cups per table for decoration
These flowers were collected from my own garden and also from my families nursery in Spring, Tx.  Collecting a few flowers from each plant really helps the plants to thrive and push more blooms. It is also very relaxing! I then take my collected flowers and depending on type use silica gel, press or use my amazing dehydrator! This is really neat process which I thoroughly enjoy.  And the flowers last almost forever instead of a couple of days.        ",10.00,5.0,"Handmade item

12938,Beach Hut Personalised Wedding Post Box / Hand-made Wedding Card Box,"
            This beach hut wedding post box is perfect for those who love the British seaside, offering a unique place for guests to leave cards on your special day. The fabulous beach hut wedding post box will be an unusual talking point on your wedding day. It will provide a feature point for your guests to deposit their cards and, being made from real wood, it is sturdy enough to be used as a storage or keepsake box after the event.
It has a large slot in the front allowing for easy posting and the lid lifts off to access the cards inside.
The beach hut wedding post box is available with a base colour of Grace White or Ivory and a wide range of contrast choices (please images for a full list) so there's sure to be something to suit. You can also choose 2 further colours for the bunting (this will also be used for the bucket, spade and ring). The plaque above the door can be personalised with up to 2 lines of text containing a maximum of 12 characters on each line and the date of the wedding can be added to the bunting too, making the box even more special and personal. Select the beach hut stripe colours from our options and then just add a ""Note to Seller"" at the checkout with your required personalisation and bunting colours.
Further personalisation options and more colours can be arranged but if you need these services then please ask prior to placing an order. Some of these extra options may incur an additional cost.
PLEASE NOTE that all items are individually handmade and personalised to order by us in our Lincolnshire workshop and each one takes time to produce so delivery will usually be within 28 days.
But this does mean that your box will be created especially for you and delivered by courier to your chosen address. We hate to disappoint so please allow plenty of time between ordering and delivery.
If you need delivery sooner then please contact us before placing an order and we might be able to help.
We ship by courier so a  signature is usually required but delivery to an alternative address or neighbour is acceptable.
Materials:
Every personalised wedding post box is carefully handmade, by us here at Lindleywood, from high-grade sustainable European pine supplied by a small local wood-merchant. It is then hand-painted with hard-wearing water-based wood paints. These paints, by Little Greene, a small independent British manufacturer from the northwest of England (who have been creating high quality paints since 1773), enable us to create beautiful products. The paints comply with European Standard BS EN 71-3:1995 (better known as the 'Toy Paint Regulations') so are safe for children too.
Important Note regarding colours: The colours shown on our paint chart are the colours we have available as standard. Please note that although we have tried to accurately portray these colours, Internet browsers and screens may cause colours to appear slightly differently.
Please be aware that each item is individually hand-made and hand-painted to order by us so one item will differ slightly from another and may not appear exactly as in the photographs of other products. This means that each product is entirely unique and extremely individual! Also note that as we make each item from wood there may some variation in grain. Over time there may also be movement in joints and surfaces. This is down to the nature of ‘real wood' as opposed to synthetic materials and we feel further adds to the individuality of each product.
Size:
The campervan wedding post box measures approximately 60cm (h) x 41cm (w) x 38cm (d).        ",218.89,5.0,"Handmade item

13366,Ivory Cluster Birdcage Veil- Ivory Flower Fascinator- Wedding Headpiece-Available in Ivory or White,"
            These 3 Ivory/Cream flowers are accented with a large rhinestone jewel in the large flower and smaller rhinestone jewels in the small flowers.  The FIFTH photo shows the veil in white.
Ivory Russian veiling surrounds the flower piece.  The veiling wraps around your head for a full over the eyes veil.  The flower piece is on a separate hair comb than the veil so the flowers can be worn separate from the veil.
The veil comes in 3 different sizes.  9"" veiling just covers the forehead, 12"" veiling comes to the eyes/nose, 18"" veiling comes to the chin. Veil length and where it comes to on your face is approximate.  The veil will need to be played around with to get it to fit the way you want it to fit.
To see how they fit go here:

This is a lovely gift for the bride to be & love token that will be long cherished as a wedding day keepsake. 
{ W E D D I N G ♥ C U S T O M }
The Lucky Sixpence was originally to be given to the bride from her father and placed in her left shoe. He did this to wish her all the blessings a father can give to his daughter. It was to symbolize good health for the couple as well as great wealth. Most important is was to ensure his daughter happiness. It is then typically passed down from generation to generation in a family.
Today the Wedding Sixpence is given to the bride from many sources. It is a popular bridal shower gift, a lovely gift from the bride's father, and is also a keepsake and family heirloom handed down from mother to daughter or father to daughter.
{ H O W - 2 - O R D E R }
Our sixpences are vintage and circulated condition with love marks from time gone by. You will receive a random year & sixpence.
You can leave it blank or I can stamp 2 initials & a ♥ (ex: J♥B) or I can stamp a year (ex: 2017) or a 6 number date (ex: 12.20.70) of your choice. 
Please add request to the Note to Seller box when you check out.
MEASUREMENTS: A sixpence is the size of an American dime. It can be safely placed in the left shoe as the tradition goes without much discomfort. 
*Love marks: are marks from time gone by. There could be a scratch, a chip, ink, paint, dent, patinas, dust, dirt, water marks, etc. Basically any mark from being used & loved by somebody before you.

            Something Old
Something New
Something Borrowed
Something Blue
And a silver sixpence for her shoe!
This little wedding rhyme came into use sometime in the late Victorian Period in England. It endures today as a custom adopted by almost every bride on her wedding day. The rhyme details those items which a bride should carry in order to insure good luck on her wedding day. 
The sixpence was a silver coin minted in the United Kingdom between the 17th and 20th centuries.
Our custom letterpress printed card comes with an easily removable sixpence coin. The card is printed on double thick cotton paper in french blue and silver. All our coins have been professionally cleaned to remove any tarnish. Our coins usually date between 1930 and 1967, when the last coin was minted in England.
Card measures 4x5 inches.

New to Stenciling? ( Here is some tips! )
Stenciling Tip 1: Use a Professional Tool
Stenciling brushes are round with short, stiff bristles. Use it in a quick up-and-down movement to dab paint onto your stencil. This helps prevent paint getting under the edges. A sponge or small roller works well too.
Stenciling Tip 2: Work from The Outside
Start panting on the edges of the stencil, working into the center, rather than from the center outwards. Again this helps prevent paint getting under the edges as you're less likely to accidentally bump the brush against an edge.
Stenciling Tip 3: Less is More
Don't overload a brush with paint as it'll seep under the edges of the stencil. Load the brush lightly, so that the ends of the bristles are covered evenly; wipe off any excess on a piece of paper or cloth.
Stenciling Tip 4: Think Thin
You'll get better results by applying two thin coats rather than one thick one.Wait for the first to dry before applying the second.
Stenciling Tip 5: Get Sticky
Keep a stencil in place by taping it at the top and bottom with a piece of tape. Low-tack tape is best as it's very easy to remove and shouldn't pull off any paint from the surface.
Stenciling Tip 6: Go Multi-Colored
To use more than one color in a stencil, use tape to mask off areas of the stencil you don't want in a particular color.
Stenciling Tip 7: Practice Makes Perfect
If you're using various stencils together, first try it out on a piece of paper. It's far easier to find out that something isn't working at this stage and then correct it than when you're painting on your final surface.
Stenciling Tip 8: Wash Regularly
Not you, your stencil! If you're doing a repeat design, wash your stencil regularly in warm water to keep the edges free of paint. If there's some paint on an edge, you won't get a crisp edge to your painted stencil.
Stenciling Tip 9: Store stencils Flat
A stencil, obviously, needs to be flat to be usable. To stop it from buckling, put it between two pieces of card and store it somewhere flat, such as in a book or telephone directory.        ",10.00,4.8982,"Handmade item

14170,FED-5C Russian Soviet USSR Rangefinder 35mm Camera Body,"
            I checked this camera body out and everything is working properly. 
The shutter works at all speeds including Bulb. All speeds including slowest speeds function as designed without lag or hesitation. The shutter curtains are in good condition without pinholes or cracking. The viewfinder is clear and sharp with minimal dust. The exposure meter is fully functional and works accurately. The self timer works perfectly. The body of the camera is in fair condition: there are no paint scuffs on the edges, nor any damages on the chrome parts, but leather is peeling from sides of body.
Comes with original leather case with shoulder strap.
I try very hard to provide accurate descriptions of the items in my store. If a camera is described as functioning properly, it is. I've tested it. If any item from my shop arrives and is not as described I'll happy refund your purchase. To my knowledge this camera functions well and should upon arrival.

This Snapchat wedding filter is an excellent addition to any wedding! Your friends and family will already be snapping all day and night. Let them remember and share their moments with a personalized filter for your day! 
This is a digital good. You will be sent a .png image file that you can directly upload to Snapchat. The file will be sent to the email address linked to your Etsy account.  
|   I M P O R T A N T   C U S T O M I Z A T I O N   D E T A I L S   |
This filter is personalized with an 18 character intro, 2 first names OR 1 last name, and a date.
Please add this information into the Notes to Seller when you are completing your purchase. The date will be written in the format you use in your note. 
Some intro ideas:
 Celebrating
 Just Married
 Just Hitched
 Celebrating Mr. & Mrs.
 Celebrating Mr. & Mr.
 Celebrating Mrs. & Mrs.
 ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥
Note: Snapchat does not allow hashtags on filters. However you can have your hashtag without the ""#"" symbol. Snapchat also does not allow first AND last names on geofilters, just one or the other.
|   H O W   D O E S   T H I S   W O R K ?   |
I will design your geofilter as you request and email it to you within the next 48 hours (though usually sooner). You will then upload it to Snapchat and select the area, date, and time you want your filter to be active. Then during that date and time anyone in the area you selected will be able to use your filter on Snapchat!
Uploading a custom filter to Snapchat is an additional expense to consider. Prices vary depending on size of location and duration. A 20,000 square foot area and 8-hour time period is 5 (the minimum dollar amount). This would cover almost all weddings. If you want your geofilter to apply to two different locations (for example in the ceremony area and a separate reception area) you will need to set two separate geofilters. Uploading your filter is a simple & quick process that you complete online with your Snapchat account. I will provide more detailed instructions on this with the delivery of your image file. Here is more information on Snapchat's On-Demand Geofilter program: https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/co/on-demand-geofilters

Please don't hesitate to reach out and message me if you have any questions or special requests. I am able to accommodate almost anything. If you are in a time crunch feel free to message me before your purchase as I am oftentimes able to complete rush orders within a couple hours at no extra charge. I also can do special requests on this design for you (colors, fonts, etc) or we can discuss a brand new custom design!

On every listing I make I include a semi transparent dark gradient behind the wording to ensure that your filter stays visible on white backgrounds. It's on the product photos in this listing-- take a look! It's very subtle and unobtrusive to your photos but makes a big impact on the readability of you filter. I also test each filter to make sure if stays visible on photos.        ",10.00,4.9865,"Handmade item

14912,"colorful sweater knitter stitch markers, snag free, colorful knitting accessory, fun gift for knitters","
            colorful, bulky sweater stitch markers...with last year's crazy cold and snowy winter, how could I resist doodling a drawer full of beautiful, cozy sweaters.  
These stitch markers are very lightweight and slip easily from needle to needle, up to US 10.5/ 6.5 mm. The set includes 1 each of the markers as shown, though yours will actually be from another set.  Due to the coloring techniques used, they may vary slightly. 
The markers will arrive safely mounted on a card.  I've put them on a bulb safety pin so they don't get separated in your knitting bag. You can pin them right onto your project, use the pin as a removable stitch marker, etc. These are water resistant, not waterproof, so please refrain from using these while knitting in a snowstorm : )
I'm offering a little gift bag and card option for my stitch markers this season. Choose your bag, and I'll select a coordinating tag for you. If you'd like me to write a note for you, just leave me a note at checkout.

15644,100 Fairy Lights (String Lights) on a 17-foot (5m) copper wire strand. Choose battery-operated or plug-in (Starry Lights) with a timer.,"
            String lights with 100 fairy lights on copper or silver wire.
***I offer the same product with remote controls.  If you want to have a remote with your lights, click on the link.***  
https://www.etsy.com/listing/481362289/remote-controlled-lights-100-fairy?ref=shop_home_active_4
This product is a string of 100 warm white Fairy Lights (also called starry lights) on a thin copper wire that is powered by 3 AA batteries, 3 C Batteries, or a wall plug. 
This item is small and great for enhancing home decor and party decor crafts. This product comes in copper or silver wire color.  There are 100 Warm White Fairy Lights on each strand, and the strands are 16.5-feet long. (5 meters)
The AA Battery Packs are roughly 2.9"" by 1.9"" by 0.75"".  They have one timer setting for 6 hours on and 18 hours off, and they have a steady-on setting where there is no timer.
The AA Pack and Waterproof AA Pack are hard-wired.  The other battery packs and wires are connected with our plug system.  The plug system allows you to change wires, change battery packs, and expand to more lights if you need to add lights.
The Waterproof AA Packs are rough 3.3"" by 2.5"" by 0.9"".  They have one timer setting for 6 hours on and 18 hours off, and they have a steady-on setting where there is no timer.
The C Battery pack is 3.3"" by 3.3"" by 1.5"".  It uses 3 C batteries.  The battery box is clear, and it is not waterproof.  The box one timer setting for 6 hours on and 18 hours off. There is also a steady-on setting where there is no timer. C batteries will last about 5 times as long as AA batteries.
The USB option plugs into any USB port.  This product has 7 feet of lead wire, and a remote control.  You can power these lights with your computer, your laptop, your car, or best of all with a wall plug that has a USB port.  (Select the plug-in option if you want us to provide the wall plug.)  For our non-USA, non-Canada customers, this would be your best option if you want plug-in lights.  Just add a local USB power plug to this product, and you are good to go!
The plug-in option uses 110V AC power. It uses an American style plug attached to the USB product described in the previous paragraph.  There are 2 USB ports on each plug-in module.  This plug-in option is not designed for outdoor use.  You can operate 2 sets of USB lights from one plug-in and with one remote.
When the timers are set, the lights come on at the same time each day. Batteries are not included with the batter pack options.
Battery life varies due to the brand and the environment, but quality AA alkaline batteries will last 15 to 20 days under normal circumstances.  C batteries will last 60 to 90 days.  *All run times are with the timer set.        ",10.00,4.9254,"Craft type: Floral arranging, Gardening, Home improvement, Party & gifting

15741,Waterless Airlock for wide mouth mason jar lacto fermenting 3 pack,"
            NEW 3 pack of Fermie Friend Waterless Airlocks for large mouth mason jar fermenting (JARS ARE NOT INCLUDED). 100% food grade silicone, non-toxic, BPA-Free, and dishwasher safe.
The lid fits onto any U.S. wide mouth mason jar (like Ball, Mason or Kerr). Attach the lid to any wide mouth mason jar - fits a half-gallon jar for larger batches and small half pint wide mouth jars.
Ferment just about any vegetable in a wide mouth mason jar.
The one piece silicone waterless airlock design allows for gasses that are created during fermentation to be vented out of the top of the lid while keeping air out of the container.
Lacto-fermentation is the process by which lactic acid bacteria metabolize vegetable sugars and create lactic acid and carbon dioxide. The process is completely vegan and should not be confused with the word “lactose,” which refers to milk sugar.
Sauerkraut is made by a process called lacto-fermentation that is analogous to how traditional (not heat-treated) pickled cucumbers and kimchi are made. The cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt and left to ferment in a wide mouth mason jar with an airlock.        ",16.99,5.0,"Craft type: Canning & preserving

            These great beads are made by the Krobo People of Ghana, Africa. Powder glass beads are made by crushing glass to a fine powder and heating it so that the particles fuse together. The glass is then poured into clay molds, with a cassava leaf stem used to make the hole. They are baked in an oven and the glass fuses and the cassava stem burns up. This technique has been used in Africa for centuries.

18150,Sterling Itty Bitty Nose Stud.,"
            Perfect and dainty, these solid sterling silver nose studs are the perfect size for everyday. Choose from a dainty, organic ball on the end or a flat head stud. Price is for one nose stud.  
I make these studs to a standard length (see last photo). Measurements are approximate as these are hand formed. The tails will be left a tad long so you can get a more custom fit. Simply trim the ending with nail clippers or wire cutters and file smooth. If a kink or bend occurs in the tail gently smooth out with your fingers.  If you need a custom length please let me know in the message section of your order.
FYI METAL TARNISHES!  Sterling studs will tarnish over time just like sterling silverware.  To bring back the original shine simply buff gently with a soft, lint-free cloth.
**** NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES due to the personal nature of this item. Please make sure this size stud head and gauge will work for you BEFORE ordering. My studs are much smaller than you would find in the stores, therefore they may not work for everyone. If you have a stud that you wear and like the fit please measure it in millimeters and I will do my best to match the length. I will NOT honor exchanges or refunds if the length does not work, it is your responsibility to measure and let me know when you place your order.        ",10.00,4.9153,"Handmade item

18571,Hemp Music Bracelet - 3 in 1 Treble Clef and Eighth Note Charm Bracelet,"
            ABOUT THIS BRACELET:
This lovely charm bracelet is like wearing three bracelets, with only one piece of jewelry! Silver toned ""8th note"" and ""treble clef"" charms are woven on to colored hemp with a casual braid between them.  Your bracelet will be made-to-order, just for you!
HEMP COLOR: Choose one from the list of colors. The featured color in the main picture is gray. Examples of the other colors are in the last picture. If you'd like your bracelet to be a combination of 2 (or 3 or 4!) please select ""combo of 2"" in the color menu and send me a message to specify the color request, either before or after purchasing.
SIZE: 
This bracelet can be made in any size you want! Please include your measurement in the ""note to seller"" box upon check out. If no size is specified, then I will make it in the most common size, 6"" expandable.
Is this a gift for someone else and you don't know their size? Not a problem, my bracelets are all adjustable via pull cords. For example, a 6"" bracelet will be 6"" around when fully tightened. But there is about 4""-5"" of cord left over for the bracelet to expand upon. This way, someone with an 8"" wrist could still wear a 6"" bracelet, but someone with a 5"" wrist may find it to be too big. If deciding between 2 sizes, go for the smaller size: bracelets can expand to be bigger, but can't be reduced any smaller than the stated size.
ABOUT FIT:
Please note, this bracelet is designed to be a fitted bracelet so that the 3 parts stay put. If the bracelet is worn too loosely the charms may overlap (which doesn't look as cool!) So if your wrist is any smaller than 6"", please let me know so I can make sure your bracelet is an appropriate fit for you :)
Rough Size Guide:
(XXS) 4""-4.5"" is for children
(XS) 5""-5.5"" is typical for older children, teens, and smaller framed women
(S) 6""-6.5"" is the most common size request I receive, fits smaller men and small to average women
(M) 7""-7.5"" is the most common size for average sized men, also for average to larger women
(L) 8""-8.5 is for larger women and average to large men
(XL) 9"" is an uncommon size, but requested a handful of times for larger men
Reference points:
Female: 5'3, 105 lbs = 5.5""
Male: 6', 200lbs = 7""

19170,"Black statement bracelet, Black silver jewelry, Fashion jewelry bracelet, Unique black bracelet, One of a kind, Oxidized silver bracelet","
            This is a one of a kind unique black statement bracelet.
This large and yet delicate bracelet is great for a sophisticated look. 
It will look especially impressive, as part of a complete monochromatic style.
You can wear it loose, close to your hand wrist, or higher on your arm like an arm band.
For an even more stunning look, you can combine two bracelets in different colors (black  silver or blackgold).
Example in the 5th picture.
I create this bracelet from a sterling silver (925) twisted wire , and each time I sculpture it in a different way, which makes it a special one of a kind piece.
For this reason, the item you get will not be exactly the same as the one in the photographs.
If you love it and choose to order it, you will be able to adjust it to your arm by gently twisting it to fit you perfectly.
Size:
This is a one size piece (adjustable to fit your arm).
Material:
Oxidized 925 sterling silver round wire.
Measurements (approximately):
Wire thickness -  1.5 m""m (0.06 inch)
Color:
Dark grey , almost black.
Available in silver or gold plated (Yellow gold color - like 18K tone).
For gold plated item: 
www.etsy.com/listing/266451762
Care and handling:
The bracelet comes in a natural fabric pouch.
The best way to store it is in the pouch. It will keep it from getting scratches when you're not wearing it.
Please prevent jewelry from coming in contact with cleaning or beauty products (hand cream, body lotion, perfume....).

With a custom order request, sizes can be made that range from preemie all the way to 12 months, and larger sizes may be available by also be custom order. Want a different color? Just ask! If these are not exactly what you are looking for just ask for a custom order. You can find the link below the listing photo. There you are able to describe what you would want.
Making these adorable little crocheted shoes & booties is a hobby of mine. I have been crocheting for the last 2 decades, and these are a favorite. I formerly sold on eBay but regret to say how unfitting that is for an item like this. My little shoes & booties deserve better! I have brought them to Etsy to share them once again. 
Acrylic yarn is safe for machine wash cold and dryer on low heat, although hand wash / air dry is recommended. DO NOT wash with items that have velcro!
I most always use synthetic yarns. I also need to mention that my items have small parts, such as buttons and embellishments. Props not included. I do all of my own photography to keep costs as low as possible.        ",10.00,5.0,"Handmade item

            These simple but darling easy on kids slippers are perfect for the toddler or preschool aged little one in your life! With 3 simple sizes fitting from a toddler shoe size 5 up to a preschooler shoe size 13, these slippers offer a great size variety.
SIZING:
Size Small: Toddler 5-7 (5.5 inch sole)
Size Medium: Toddler 8-10 (6.5 inch sole)
Size Large: Preschool 11-13 (7.5 inch sole)
If you want the best possible fit, have your child step on a piece of paper and trace their foot and measure and order slightly larger than your child's foot. These have a great amount of stretch, so sizing doesn't have to be exact, but it's of course always best to get shoes or slippers a little big for growing feet!
These slippers are made with 100% acrylic yarn for lasting durability, and I will apply a bead of a dimensional fabric paint to add a non slip sole at your request. I will do my best to match the color of the slippers you choose, but if you would like a special color or the clear glitter as shown, just let me know at checkout.

            This is a great penny keychain that makes for an awesome anniversary gift, engagement gift, or a gift for various other occasions!
This lucky penny key chain will be hand stamped with initials with a heart stamped around the year of the penny and then the rest of the date in numbers off to the side of the year of penny.  
IMPORTANT*** Please make sure that you leave me both your initials and the full anniversary date in the note to seller box when you check out!
We use a much different process than traditional engraving, which only carves a light groove into the metal. Our products are all uniquely stamped by hand with a hammer and steel stamp, which is a more forceful technique resulting in a much longer-lasting finish. Because our products are not made via machines, it should be expected that reasonable variations will occur; these only contribute to the uniqueness and quality of each hand-finished piece.
Copper will tarnish to a natural aged patina. This is normal. If you would like to keep your keychain polished, please use the enclosed complimentary polish pad.
Thank you for ordering from PickityPick, we look forward to creating a one of a kind item just for you!

This button reads ""Stay Sexy Don't Get Murdered"" surrounded by a floral wreath. If flowers aren't your thing, there is also a blood splatter themed design with the same phrase available in my shop (https://www.etsy.com/listing/489494815/stay-sexy-dont-get-murdered-blood?ref=shop_home_active_5).

Please note: If you order a button with a magnet back, they are not meant to be functional, just decorative. At this time the magnet backings are not strong enough to hold up paper, documents, and/or pictures. They are just decorative. Thank you!
-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*-.*
All buttons are my design. They are made individually, by hand, with love, by me. Because they are handmade, variations and imperfections are to be expected. I try to only send the best buttons but if your button, for whatever reason, is not made to your satisfaction or arrive damaged, contact me and we can work something out!
I try to ship orders out as fast as humanly possible! USPS shipping time depends on where you live. Hopefully you will receive your murderously cute buttons as quickly as possible!
