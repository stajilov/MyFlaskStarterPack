The round locket sits beneath a dark purple amethyst coin.  Tiny amethyst rondelles accent the new 14k gold fill chain, which is finished with a lobster clasp.

944,Antique Silver Locket 1891 Victorian Silver Locket 1800s Estate Jewellery Victorian Silver Jewellery Victorian Silver Love Token 1800s,"
            A charming and unusual looking  antique Victorian Silver Locket with a glass front. It is hallmarked for Birmingham 1891. It also bears the maker's initials but these are a little difficult to read.
The glass is bevelled and to the top is an usually designed loop through which a necklace can be passed through. The back of the pendant is prettily decorated with engraved floral work.
DIMENSIONS: Height: 1 1/4"" (including the loop) x 3/4"" across with a depth of 1/4""
CONDITION: For its long age, the pendant is in a good condition. The glass has a few minor nicks together with some surface scratches, and the inner frame (which is holding in the glass section) is tarnished in places.
However these do not detract from the attractive appearance the locket has.
Please note that as the items we sell are antique or vintage, most of them will have been used for the purpose that was intended. Therefore they may have signs of wear in keeping with age and use. Any damage will be described with accompanying photographs.

 dictionary pages
 old stamp collector book pages

 Each pack has been arranged, tied in raffia and packed in a cellophane reseal bag for presentation as a gift. 
 Page sizes range from A6 to A4. 
 No two packs are identical but each pack has a pretty good variety. 
The pages are taken from old salvaged books that I have rescued along my travels. Pages may contain aged yellowing, creasing, staining and some may have small tearing. Pages have been ripped and separated along the seams and may have tiny puncture marks where the old string binding has been removed. This all adds to the rustic charm and patina of the pages.

These range in size from teeny tiny to fairly large; most white/ivory in color but some darker.  The lot will include two hole, four hole, and shank style  buttons.  These are great for mixed media, scrap booking, collage, and, of course, sewing!  I will select a random assortment trying to give a mix of sizes/shapes.  These are unwashed true antique/vintage previously used buttons some with threads still in tact.  The pictures are representative of the lot you will receive NOT the actual lot.

The buttons may vary slightly but we stand behind our quality.  We mix them in a huge barrel and then scoop out one lot at at time.  We have been selling them like this for many years and we are very serious about the color tones and sizes looking very close to the photo.  Many were made in Germany or France and were made for the garment industry. These are quality buttons and not cheap China buttons.        ",15.99,4.9545,"Vintage Supply from the 1980s

3054,Stunning antique French Jacob Delafon bath shower mixer  faucet taps C1900,"
            These are magnificent, and getting harder and harder to find, to be honest whenever I see antique fittings and faucets of this quality I buy them (curiously I have a penchant for antique bathroom fixtures, they were almost sculptural in design) these particular beauties were made by the grand daddy of French bathroom fixtures 'Jacob Delafon' his fittings were of the very finest quality and adorned the finest homes in France and they obviously command a very high price now on the salvage market.  I managed to get these taps at source for a song, so I am passing on my good fortune to someone who will revel in them as I do!
They really would MAKE a bathroom.  Wonderful quality. Heavy gauge brass with a nickel finish with beautiful porcelain inserts reading 
Chaud - Hot. 
Froid - Cold.
Bain - Bath
Douche - shower
They have the most amazing patina only acquired with great age, I find them utterly charming.
Condition report
I am selling them in 'as is' condition, there is wear and Verdi Gris to the finish.  They are untried and not tested, but all of the taps turn with ease.  With these older taps be prepared to do a little work, washers may need replacing etc.. But for this price you would struggle to get reproduction fixtures never mind original Jacob Delafon, so a compromise may have to be made.  I am just passing on my previous experience of antique bathroom ware, it is fitted throughout my home with no issues, but a little more care is required when fitting, but the finish is ABSOLUTELY worth it! 
You can actually have a look on YouTube, there are lots of videos on how to refurbish antique faucets, it's really not as hard as you imagine, I have personally just done a set of taps for a shower that leaked and needed new internal mechanisms (10 online) they now work like new. And all this info is worst case scenario as they have not been tested properly.
NB I do have some modern chromed elbow joints that fit these taps that I will include free of charge in the sale, you may not wish to use them, but your plumber will be very grateful as they will make fitting a lot easier and you won't have the trouble I had trying to find some.

            RARE! GENUINE! TOP HAT!  Circa 1890's made by D. Magee's Sons in St. John, New Brunswick, Canada . . With original, hand stitched, leather carry case. 
 
Silk, wool and felt are/were the most common materials used to make these hats.  This hat does have a brush and a perfect concentric pattern on the top, and I've not been able to determine if this is silk plush or genuine beaver felt (neither material is currently available).  From what I've read it takes an expert to tell the difference, however, D. Magee's Sons, in St. John was listed as ""Hatters & Furriers"" and were in business in the late 1800's 
Hat is in amazing shape for its age . . . exterior is in remarkable shape and the only sign of wear I see is two very small spots on the side where it looks like the nap is worn
Black grosgrain ribbon around the brim . . . brim is firm and contoured with some wear on the very edges . . .  also comes with a wool band that I assume goes over the ribbon
Interior is clean and undamaged and has the makers stamp which reads D. Magee's Sons . . 63 King Street . . St. John, N.B.
shown in photo . . additional photos available upon request
Inner circumference: 22 & 1/2""
The crown rises: 6 & 1/4 inches
Brim extends:  2""
Pristine sweat band,  width: 2 & 1/2""
Comes with leather carry case and velvet dust pillow.  Handle firmly attached with original rivets/stitching.  It appears the  stitching holding the strap to the case has at some point been repaired, but is fully functional . . .  lock still works and key is attached . . . the lid lining has a brown stain as shown in photo
The original leather case has obviously seen some serious miles.  Shipping labels indicate travel to London, Brussels, Budapest, Liverpool, Paris, Charing Cross (via Calais) with the home address in Quebec.  Regardless, it still  keeps the hat snug, safe and protected inside

6188,"Chicken Sweater, Sweater for Chickens and Roosters, Sweater for Chickens, Chicken Clothes, Gift Ideas","
            Chicken Sweater is hand knitted in quality acrylic blend yarn with buttons for safe and snug enclosure.
Really fun photo prop! 
If you would like a specific color or shade, please indicate in ""note to seller"" when checking out.
Sizes available in MINI, BANTAM, STANDARD, and LARGE. For an exact fit I will need the following measurements in inches: 
Base of neck to base of tail, width across back of neck, tip of wing to tip of wing (across back). 
I can not accept returns on sweaters after they have been worn for sanitation reasons. Please be sure to check sizing before ordering.
Toggles/Buttons may differ from picture based on availability. Color may vary based on computer settings. Multicolor/variegated yarns man differ by skein of yarn due to differences in manufacturer dyes.
Can be easily slipped over your chicken's head and buttoned on each side. The sweater is moderately stretchy and will become slightly bigger with wear due to the nature of yarn. The stretch makes it easier to offer universal sizes as there is room to adjust the sweater based on your chicken. 
Please do not leave sweaters on your chickens without supervision. The material is not entirely waterproof and can snag. It is best used as a PHOTO PROP ONLY.
If you want a perfectly fit sweater, you need to provide measurements. Please ask by sending a conversation.

8622,"Hippopotamus Garden Sculpture, Hippo Ornament 27"" Long, Concrete Cast","
            Amazing LARGE 27"" Hippo/ Hippopotamus, garden sculpture.
Due to the fantastic success and popularity of my previous Hippo garden sculpture I decided to create a much larger version of the Hippo. I sculpted the Hippo in the same style as the smaller 17"" version I sell so that previous customers can display them together.  Please see my other listings for the smaller 17"" Hippo.
I feel that outdoor sculptures should be as detailed as indoor sculptures, and I feel the the lack of detail on a lot if not most of the sculptures in garden centres is very evident. With this in mind I created this Hippo sculpture and will create other highly detailed garden sculptures in the future.
As you can see the Hippo looks great in the pictures, I've taken pictures of the Hippo when it's dry and wet so you can see exactly what the colours are like. when the Hippo is wet it looks even more authentic as real hippo's have a shine to their backs when they are submerged in the water. I've also taken some detailed close ups so you can clearly see the texture and quality finish of this garden sculpture.
The Hippo garden sculpture is cast using concrete mixed with fine grain sand for a smoother finish that can take finer detail from the mould. 
 Also don't forget to Like, Tweet and Pin this listing to share with your friends and family and see what they think! (you can find social media links to your right just under the ''Add To Cart'' button)
The approx size is: (length 27"") (width 12"") (height 4"") inches. (Colour may vary)

I have been studying herbs and creating herbal apothecary items for over 21 years.  I create everything with loving intention and healing energy.
I use the finest ingredients I can find for my body care products.  Organic and local as much as possible.  A lot of the herbs are grown and/or wild crafted from right here on our sustainable farm.  I only use herbs and essential oils to add fragrance - no chemical fragrance oils.  
 
All body care and apothecary products are created in small batches by hand (by me!).

9507,"x2 Hippo, Hippopotamus Garden Ornaments, Sculptures 17"" 27"" or 22"" Your Choice of Two! Easter Gift, Mother's Day","
            Welcome to my Etsy listing! This listing is for TWO Hippos, the photos above are of all three to show you how they look together, but if you purchase this listing your will receive the smallest 17"" hippo and then you choose either the 27"" Hippo (in the centre) or the Hippo head Using the options above near the price.
 If you purchase this listing you save £10.00 on the Hippos and also the postage for the smaller 17"" hippo is FREE! this is especially beneficial for my overseas customers as for instance customers in the USA will save £28.05 on the postage of the 17"" hippo plus the £10.00 discount on the Hippos themselves so that's a £38.05 discount! (the discount varies depending on where you live) 
The reason I can do this deal is because I can pack the 17"" hippo with either of the larger Hippos because it stays within the package weight limit. But I have to pack the larger one's separately because packing them together would send the package over the weight limit!
If you wanted a set of three Hippos the best thing to do is order this listing and then go to my single listings and then choose the other larger Hippo you want. So for instance if you purchase this listing and then choose the 27"" hippo option, then you could go to the listing for the hippo head and add that to your order, that way the postage price is correct and you've still saved money!
 I'm very proud to offer to you my Hippo garden sculptures! I created this range of Hippopotamus garden ornaments which have all proved to be hugely popular. People from all around the world buy my Hippos, from the UK to the USA, Germany, Japan ect, and no matter where they go they always delight my customers and bring a smile to their faces!
A lot of people buy my Hippos as gifts for Birthdays, Weddings, Father's/Mother's day, Christmas gifts and they are well received by the recipients as you will see from the comments I've had about my Hippos from previous customers (click the link above with the yellow stars on it to see my feedback). People also buy them to treat themselves and add some character to their gardens and are a delight for them and visitors to their garden to look at, so much so that I have many repeat customers who come back and buy my other Hippos to complete the set. I've also had friends of my customers buying them from me as they saw them in their friends gardens and couldn't resist having some in their garden.
If you or one of your friends or family would like to see these Hippos emerging from their lawn this sping/ summer why not order these charming and tactile garden ornaments now! Also please take a look at my other Hippopotamuses in my Etsy shop and see if you'd like to add any of them to your family too!

10052,Pandora's Dice Tray,"
            These are wooden dice trays are hand made in the USA. They are intended for use with all forms of dice based games. Be it miniature games, board games, role playing games, or purely dice based games. They also work well as a transport tool for moving models from table to table while gaming, being able to hold entire skirmish sized armies.
The trays are finished in a range of stains, which are sealed in with multiple layers of varnish. The trays are also inlaid with genuine leather bottoms in a range of colors. The edges are all sanded and rounded for a smooth feel and easy handling.
The trays are durable, resistant to scuffing, water resistant, and cleanable. The layers of varnish seal in your chosen stain color and protects the wood from the hazards of use and wear, while also making them easy to clean. Spilled liquids can be cleaned right up without damaging the finish.
The leather inlays help protect the tray and your dice. The leather softens the sound of impacting dice while also protecting them from getting scratched from repeated rolling on textured gaming boards. The leather is cleanable and won't get clotted up or shed like felt can after repeated use.
Each tray also has small rubber feet to raise it up off the tabletop, reduce sliding, and limit wear on the bottom of the tray.
As they are all hand made each tray is unique with slight variations in the build, stain, varnish, and leather inlay. They all have their own unique features and subtle differences.

            These piano rolls are in good condition in the original boxes.
NOTE: I have several more that are not listed in the drop down. If you are looking for something specific, please convo me. 
Approximate size: 
28.5 cm W x 560 cm L
11.25"" W x 220.5"" L (18.4')
NOTE: The length of these rolls vary slightly. In order to reduce the risk of damage to these delicate items, I have only measured a few and reflect the average length. The width is the same for all. 
Some History:  QRS has been manufacturing piano rolls since 1900 and is the only manufacturer of piano rolls still in business today, with over 5,000 master recordings and 45,000 music rolls. We have rolls from actual performances by legendary greats such as Liberace, Scott Joplin, Fats Waller and George Gershwin, among others. We also offer more contemporary selections from artists ranging from Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald to Elton John, Billy Joel, and Yanni. Check out their website at:  www.qrsmusic.com.
If you don't have a player piano, piano rolls are great for recycling as paper for scrapbooking or decorating; think table-runner or placemats for parties for your school band or orchestra, or I have seen them used as wallpaper. 
I've priced US shipping for media mail. If you would like oth

            Leuchtturm 1917 or A5 notebook leather cover and Ipad Mini cover. Travel accessories. Agenda leather cover. Leather portfolio. This is a leather cover for an A5 notebook like the Leuchtturm 1917 or the Moleskine large notebook (less wide than an A5), your Ipad Mini, your  phone, or crayons, pencils, passport, cards, travel memories... anything you want.  The pocket on the front left side is made with the natural shape of the leather so all cases will be different. 
COLORS: Take a look at the fourth picture to see the available colors.
CLOSURES: You can choose a strap with a buckle (not attached to the cover), a detachable wrap leather strap, both or without closure. They are made with the same leather that's used for the cover. Last picture shows the different possibilities. Remember that if you use a notebook with elastic band you can use it as a closure.
It's been a long time working in the perfect cover for my travel journals and I've finally got it: the perfect notebook cover for your travels or for your agenda. 
This case is made using only leather and waxed thread, there are no metal things and no zippers, that way your case will last for ever, nothing will broken or rust and the case will be better with the pass of time.
This cover is for A5 sized notebooks like Leuchtturm 1917 that measure: 5,7 x 8.2 inches (14,5 x 21 cm) or you can use any other notebook of similar sizes like the Large Moleskines that measure 5 x 8.2 inches (13 x 21 cm) .
Material: Full grain oiled leather. 
Leather cover size: 6.8 x 9.2 inches (17,5 x 23,5 cm)

Just Wanderlust leather goods are hand-cut and hand stitched without using any machines, and the materials are in limited supply what makes each item very unique. No two accessories are exactly the same. Please note that some may have natural leather markings. I prefer hand stitching because is stronger than the lock stitch used in sewing machines and the finish is much more beautiful and rustic. These are accessories that last a lifetime.

PLEASE LEAVE IN NOTES TO SELLER:
1. Name(s)
2. Date (Optional)
3. Location (Optional) 
4. Font Style Number for Middle Name line (Optional) (if not included will leave the same as listing picture)
*You will select what you would like the top line of text to read and the middle line font color when you purchase at the drop down menus*
*There is a very subtle black gradient on the bottom of the filter behind the text so the text will show up wonderfully against any photo background!*
*The purchase price includes 2 revision changes. Any changes after that will cost 5 usd per additional proof (unless it is by fault of OnLoveandCoffee) so please check the information you submit carefully :)*
What you will receive is a PNG file that meets Snapchat's guidelines and is 100% ready for submitting/uploading to Snapchat. 
*Please note the below is NOT accepted by snapchat, so please do not include any in notes to seller*
-Hashtags with the # sign

-Cuss Words
Filters also will not work in Mexico!
*Please allow at least 1 business day for your filter to be submitted and reviewed by Snapchat. They will not accept same day submissions. Approval on the weekend does happen, but it can be slower and is risky*

LEARN MORE ABOUT SNAPCHAT GEOFILTERS- 
Please note that there are additional expenses involved when uploading a custom filter to Snapchat. Prices can vary widely depending on size of location and duration. For example, a 20,000 square foot area and 8-hour time period is 5 (which is the minimum dollar amount). When you go to upload your filter, this is a simple & quick process which you will complete online with your Snapchat account. For more information on Snapchat's On-Demand Geofilter program, please visit:
 https://www.snapchat.com/on-demand (this is where you will upload the file) and
https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/odg-howto
Once you have your filter all setup with Snapchat, it will then be available during the time and location selected for your event. You need to have your ""location settings"" enabled for snapchat. To use it, you take the photo on snapchat, then swipe right until you see your custom filter. You can then send the filtered pictures within snapchat or download the image with the filter and repost to various social media sites (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc) or just keep the images as a fun memento of your event!
**This shop is not liable for anything after the snapchat is approved within Snapchat. No refunds will be given after the final snapchat filter is emailed to purchaser**

______________________________________________________________________
Use your imagination to create your event card box.  
Slot is on second tier for cards to drop down but top lid can also be removed and cards dropped down to accommodate holding more cards.  Boxes hollowed out so cards drop to bottom.  Set is mailed nested and all you do is put lids on to stack and secure.
Boxes are intended to be painted (paint recommendations will be on your invoice). If you want to cover in fabric, please make that request at checkout and boxes will be sent with bases unattached to the lower lid and you will have to glue/attach yourself.
(Note: due to the nature of the unfinished boxes, slight variations or flaws may appear, but can easily be covered up with paint - paint recommendations given after checkout on your invoice)

            Any fabric ordered will be cut from a bolt when it is ordered.
It will be a continuous piece of fabric if you order 1 yard, 2 yards or 5 yards.
The only exception is remnants which is typically the end of a bolt and always clearly marked as such.
No fabric is cut ahead of time.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
If you know someone who loves building with Legos then you can probably think of dozens of projects you could do with this fun building block fabric.
The fabric is lightweight, similar to what I would call linen. 
If you would like to receive a small sample of cotton-poly fabric let me know.
The colors are Red, Blue, Light Blue, Yellow and Green.
The pattern repeats every 3 inches vertically and every 3 inches from side to side.

This fabric can be washed and ironed the same as any other cotton-poly fabric.
I often apply an iron-on interfacing when I need the fabric to have a stiffer feel.
Steam will not hurt the fabric but when ironing it is recommended that steam, or anything above a low heat setting, not be used until after the fabric has been through multiple washing and drying cycles.

16120,Phoenix Duochrome Color Shifting Top Coat Red to Green Indie Nail Lacquer Starlight Polish Unicorn Pee,"
            Phoenix is a color shifting duochrome top coat, meant for layering over other polishes.  It is one of Mythological Top Coat trio, which is a set of three color shifting duochrome top coats.  Phoenix shifts from red to gold to green, and flashes vivid red and bright green at the extremes of its color range.  It's beautiful, and pictures don't do justice to the color shift.  The nail wheel swatches show two coats on black.  Phoenix is the shade on the right in the fourth picture.  
NOTE: Due to the limited availability of the pigment used in the Phoenix polishes, there is now a restriction on their purchase. The limit is not more than 30mL per person per 12 month period per individual Phoenix-named polish. The limit is in mL rather than bottles because it applies to both mini bottles and full size bottles. It's 30mL per Phoenix-type polish, so a person could purchase two full size bottles of each Phoenix-named polish in a 12 month period. The polishes that have purchase restrictions are: Phoenix top coat, Phoenix Song top coat, Phoenix Feathers, and Phoenix Fire. This limitation covers individual bottles and sets. For those people interested in doing group orders, contact me first to work something out. If there are any questions or anyone would like more information, please contact me. I'm always happy to explain!
The wonderful Lauren of Dizzy Nails was kind enough to review this polish.  The first picture is a compilation from three of her photos, to show Phoenix at different angles.  The second picture is one of her photos of Phoenix top coat and Unicorn top coat (with Unicorn on the index and ring fingers, and Phoenix on the middle and pinky fingers).  Both pictures show Phoenix over black.  Her photos are fabulous and show the color shift far better than mine.  Please go see her review (and more photos!) here: http://www.dizzynails.com/2012/08/unicorn-and-phoenix.html
The last picture shows what the 15mL and 5mL bottles will look like. I also have the three Mythological Top Coat polishes listed as a set, in both 15mL and 5mL sizes, for less than buying each color individually.
The color shifting pigment in the Phoenix polishes is very similar (and displays a very similar shift) to the pigment in the original elusive unicorn pee.  The pigment in this is the same type of pigment (Polyacrylate-4, red to green shift), but made by a different manufacturer, which results in two minor differences.  The first is that the particle size is not exactly the same.  The second is that the precise spectrum of the color shift and what shade is produced by a particular angle of light are not identical - very, very close, but not identical.  If you have additional questions, or would like the longer and more detailed version of this explanation, please feel free to message me!  
Phoenix is a custom polish, made from scratch with nail lacquer base and color shifting pigment. Starlight Polish is 5 free, meaning free of DBP, toluene, formaldehyde, formaldehyde resin, and camphor, and contains no carmine or other animal-derived pigments.        ",5.75,4.9519,"Handmade item

Shea butter has soothing, moisturizing and protecting effects. Due to the presence of a sizable quantity of unsaponifiable fats, its content in vitamins and other active elements, Shea butter adds other more precise activities to these general properties. It displays a protecting role against UV rays because of its content in cinnamic acid and can thus be incorporated in solar products. The natural latex contained in Shea butter would moreover prevent certain sun allergies. Shea butter also helps cell regeneration and capillary circulation. This favors the healing of small wounds, skin cracks and crevices, and skin ulcers. In the cosmetic field, this property is an asset against skin aging. It has restructuring effects on the epidermis, also on dry and fragile hair. Dry skin, dermatitis, dermatoses, eczema, sun burn, and burns are all helped by natural Shea butter. It has an anti-elastics characteristic which makes it a good active ingredient against stretch marks. Shea butter can also be used to treat rheumatism and aching muscles, and to ease colds because it decongestant nasal mucous tissues. It is very well tolerated by the skin for it does not normally trigger any allergic reaction and can even be used on very sensitive skin areas such as mucous tissues and around the eyes.

FOR BRACELETS CONTAINING AMBER STONE: All stones in our chakra bracelets are handcrafted with authentic stones, with the exception of the amber bead, which is synthetic. The reason for this is because amber is extremely expensive to obtain, and adding amber to each bracelet would drive the price up dramatically. However, we DO offer the option of customizing the bracelet with an authentic amber stone, but please note that your new total will be 25.
I've Handmade These Healing 7 Chakra Volcanic Stone Bracelets With Love and Care.
This bracelet features Lava Stone, Red Agate, Lazurite, Amethyst, Turquoise Stone, Tiger Eye, Green King Stone, and Amber to represent the 7 chakras and is hand-crafted with love.
Red Agate - Regulates Root Chakra • Cleanses aura • Balances spiritual, physical and intellectual energy • Balances Solar Plexus Chakra • Stimulates positive energy to emotions • Eases stress and anxiety
Amber - Regulates Sacral Chakra • Increases recovery time • Protects against negative energies • Attracts love and loving energies • Electrifies desire • Draws out inner warmth
Tiger's Eye - Regulates Solar Plexus Chakra • Heightens courage • Increases integrity • Sharpens inner vision • Stimulates metabolism
Green King Stone - Regulates Heart Chakra • Purifies and strengthens nervous system •Encourages gratitude • Soothes and quiets the mind • Relieves fatigue and exhaustion
Turquoise - Regulates Throat Chakra • Considered the “Master Healer” stone • Repairs spiritual injury, mental strife and previous trauma • Promotes communication, resolving hostilities and arguments • Heightens wisdom • Absorbs negative energies to protect the wearer
Lazurite - Regulates Third Eye Chakra • Aids in meditation • Increases awareness • Blocks negative energies • Encourages ease of expression • Clears the mind
Amethyst - Regulates Crown Chakra • Enhances intuition and psychic powers • Aids in meditation and lucid dreaming • Stabilizes emotions
Lava stone - Very protective stone • Excellent for removing negativity and attracting love and positive energy • Powerful cleanser of psychic smog created within your aura, and is a strong psychic protection stone • Formed from volcanic eruptions cools on the earth's surface, the speed at which it cools prevents crystallization and the rock forms as solid volcanic rock.

First wash is important!! Product is not pre-washed. Wash dark colors separately.
Some shrinkage is normal for cotton and rayon garments, please allow for this.

If hand washing is not your thing, it's best if you machine wash in cold water & hang dry.

            Aluminum keychain hand-stamped with a coordinate of your choice.  It can be stamped on all four sides, but if you're only getting one coordinate, it will only be two sides unless you choose to fill the other sides with something else.
Do you know a location that you want but don't know the coordinates for it or how to find them?  Message us, and we'll find them for you :)
The different Orientation options are as follows:
""Opposite Sides"" - This is NOT what is shown in the pictures of this listing.  In this orientation, one coordinate will be stamped on the keychain, and the other one will be stamped on the opposing side.  Only two sides will be stamped.
""Adjacent Sides"" - This is what is shown in the picture.  One coordinate on one edge, the other on the edge directly adjacent to it.  Only two sides will be stamped.
""All Four Sides"" - In this orientation, the coordinates will be stamped alternating with each other on all four sides.
Looking for something other than coordinates, but still want the bar keychain?  Check out our generic Bar Keychain listing here: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/266904981
The bar keychain is 2 inches long.
Please leave your customization request in the ""Note to Seller"" box before checkout.
