1278,Men's vintage Orient watch Diver watch Automatic watch Japanese watch Large watch Gift for him,"
            The Orient Watch Company is one of the largest producers of mechanical watches in Japan. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seiko Epson but designs and manufactures separately from Seiko. 
Needing an inexpensive modern movement for mass production, Orient licensed the Seiko 7006 movement design along with the Seiko 6600 Magic Lever automatic winding mechanism. These were combined to become the Orient 46 movement, which is still the company's mainstream automatic watch movement today. Orient also manufactures a number of other movements, including the high-end Orient 88700. 
Orient is unusual in that they produce all of their own movements, including most components, in-house.
The Japanese Orient diver automatic watch works and keeps time well. The black  dial has white indexes and it is in good condition, however the glass and the bezel show some age marks. It also has a date and a day windows at 3 o'clock with quick date set up. Some sizes for you 44mm bezel that rotates 48mm with case and crown guard, lug to lug 51mm, thickness around 13 mm.
The Orient comes with new N.D.LIMITS diver strap.
This watch will make a fine addition to any watch collection.
As a vintage watch the water resistance cannot be guaranteed.
Please also mind that any mechanical watch should be serviced regularly.

Please pardon the non-Professional photos.  I took these photos right in my living room.  I bought this gorgeous piece(along with another chandelier) for my own home only to find out that it would be too large for my small/low ceiling powder room.  So my loss is your gain!
I can't even tell you how Beautiful this chandelier is.  And I can see nothing wrong with it at all.  Nothing to point out.
This chandelier is super heavy and total quality.  Actually, it's a piece of ART!

            Awesome bundle of deep purple, bright orange and silver flowers, handmade out of vintage seed beads in Venice, Italy in the 1960s. Each flower is on a 2.5"" piece of wire; wires are thin and pliable, if you want to take them apart and make something out of them...although they are pretty cute just in a vase!
Each bundle has 12 flowers
Each flower is approximately 15mm diameter. Wires can be manipulated to spread petals out and position flowers to your liking.        ",10.00,4.9055,"Vintage Supply from the 1960s

5311,Hand Crafted BABY PLAYING an Original LITHOGRAPH Print By Maud Tausey Fangel,"
            Up for sale is an original lithograph by Maud Tausey Fangel of a playing baby with special additions.   
Wikipedia "" For a good part of the first half of the twentieth century, Ms. Fangel was the children's artist in our country -- her illustrations of ruddy-cheeked, doe-eyed, curly-locked children were everywhere. They set the standard for their day .... Many of Ms. Fangel's pictures were done in pastels, which allowed her to capture the movements of her young subjects in swift, impressionistic strokes. Most of Ms. Fangel's models were children from poor families, from orphanages, and settlement houses. Unaware of this, one newspaper referred to these children as ""glamor babies."" But Ms. Fangel understood the youngsters who sat and wiggled and dozed in the high chair for her a little more deeply than the correspondent: ""I have a strange, persistent feeling that babies have a consciousness that we do not possess,"" she wrote. ""They seem not yet to have lost an intelligence brought with them from another world. They are still wrapped in the mystery of their source."" 
       My mom took this wonderful print and added her artistic touch.   She made the satin pillow and added a lace edging.   She also crocheted the baby sweater and baby booties and made the diaper and dress.  She then decoupaged the print with her special additions.    She made this to hang in my baby room in 1947.   It looks like she reframed it at one point and eventually it landed in the cedar chest.   I have it hanging in the bedroom now and  It comes from a Tabaco Free Home.  I do my best to describe each item as accurately as possible.   I take lots of pictures from lots of angles.  Please see the pictures for details as they are part of the description. If you can't see everything you want, I will be happy to send you more pictures. If you want more details please ask questions.   It  will be packed very carefully.  I will ship same day if cleared payment received before Noon, will ship next day if payment received after Noon.  Thanks for looking!        ",49.99,4.9636,"Vintage item from the 1940s

9498,Mad Max: Fury Road - Nux's Bird Bobblehead,"
            ""What a day! What a lovely day!!""
Up for sale is a replication of the cobbled bobble-head bolted to Nux's dashboard, from the latest Mad Max installment, Fury Road.
Made in a similar fashion, each bobble-head is hand-made: the ""jaw"" is made of welded plate steel (all cut and shaped by hand, and then soldered together), the skull is a resin cast from an original sculpt by me, based on images of the skull used in the film; the base is a custom sculpt based on a real Minsup Coupler, but sized larger to have more visual substance, and cast in a lead-free pewter.
What is being sold is the bobble only; if you want to put it on your dashboard, I recommend industrial strength velcro or hot glue as an alternative to bolting it in.
With this companion at your side, you will ensure your ride into Valhalla will always be witnessed by at least one.
NOTE: Because each piece is assembled by hand on order, there will be some variances all across each piece; no one will be exactly the same as before or be exactly as the ones in the image show. It won't be drastically different but there will be some subtle differences in each piece.        ",120.00,4.8537,"Handmade item

9770,Burgle Bros. Board Game Insert,"
            This insert for the Burgle Bros. board game is designed to organize all the game components and still fit inside the unique box the game comes in.  It includes a bottom divider to hold the cards, room tiles, and walls and a top divider to hold the characters, guards, dice, and organize the game tokens.
If you select ""Yes"" for the ""Sleeving your cards?"" option you will receive the insert without the divider between the rooms and cards installed to accommodate the extra room needed for sleeved cards.  The divider will come loose with the insert should you want to install it later.
It is recommended to remove the cardboard spacer in the lid of box for use with this insert as shown in the last image.
FAQs
Burgle Bros. has been through two print runs and if you acquired the game after January 1st, 2017 it is likely you have a second printing.  The second print run had changes made to the components which required a redesign of the insert, thus the different layout.  If you are unsure of which printing you have take a look at the rulebook.  The second print run rulebook has 22 pages with page numbers at the bottom of each page while the first print run rulebook has 14 pages and no page numbers.
The first print version of the insert does not have a labeled space for the replacement tokens pack intended to replace the missing tokens from the second print run.  These tokens can be easily stored with the meeples however.  The replacement token pack can be found here should you need them (https://boardgamegeekstore.com/products/burgle-bros-replacement-chit-set-alter-ego).
Both versions of the insert are able to fit the promo event cards.  The promo pack can be found here (https://boardgamegeekstore.com/products/burgle-bros-5-promo-event-pack).        ",7.00,4.9831,"Handmade item

10006,Yarn Playing Card Holder.,"
            We are selling just the card holder not the cards.  Available in multiple colors.  The card holder is 3 inches in diameter and holds up to 14 card.  You can place your cards in this card holder and they will not fall out when turned upside down or when laid on a table.  The card holder are made of yarn with a plastic center. These are the ultimate card holder.  I started making them after using cardholders that would drop the cards during my card games if I turned them the wrong way.  They can be used for any card game and let you focus on the game rather then your tired hand. I make each holder myself and have many different color combinations ready to go. Just message me your color preferences. These are a great addition to a gift of a pack of cards or a board game; something extra that is handmade and says you care.
If you want to order several in different colors pick the option, mix of colors.  If you want to pick the colors that I sent to you just write a note in your order telling me what colors you would like me to send.        ",5.00,4.9333,"Handmade item

The pages are still tightly bound and there is no cracking to the spine.  Lavishly illustrated by the author, who was mostly known as a famous fashion photographer.  
The book is 397 pages long and measures 6.5"" x 9.5"" x 1.5"".

14040,Glass Dip Pen - Calligraphy Pen,"
            This listing is for one Romantic, marbled, hand-blown glass dip pen made in the Murano/Venetian style. These particular glass pens are very easy to write and draw with. They aren't too thick or heavy and each pen measures: 
7 1/2"" x 5/8"" x 5/8""
We currently have six different glass pen colors in stock:
• Red
• Multi Colored
• Green
• Black
• Red & Yellow
• Blue
Please choose your color before check-out. 
Glass ink pens were invented in during the height of the Renaissance in Venice, Italy. They were invented to solve the problem that many people had with quill pens and wooden dip pens in that the nibs would run out of ink too quickly, causing the writer to interrupt their work by frequently dipping the pen into the inkwell. 
These ingenious pen tips contain spiral grooves on the glass which holds more ink for a continuous flow. These pens were made to be dipped into ink bottles or inkwells. Ink also washes easily off of a glass pen and they are very easy to write and draw with because there is no nib or quill to split. (One just has to worry about them shattering if they are dropped.) 
The colors are marbled in the traditional Venetian glass blowing style. The entire pen is made of glass. 
Our pens come in a padded gift box with a piece of sandpaper for sharpening the tip of the pen. (Because these pens are made of glass, the tip can dull after use, one ""sharpens"" the pen by gently sanding the tip back into a point.) 
You will receive one pen and one gift box with your order, the inkwells and ink bottles are not included. You can however, purchase ink, paper and inkwells within our Arcane Objects Shop!
We can only accept returns or exchanges on art materials like this if they are returned in unused condition with packaging intact and in its original condition.

Are you worried about the download process once you've purchased my digital paper?  Please don't be :)
Send me a convo whenever you like and I can help you with anything.  Usually the jpegs that are the papers, come zipped up in a folder.  Most computers have a button that says 'extract' or 'extract all' after you've downloaded when you are viewing the zip folder.  Once your computer has extracted the jpegs, you can then go and import them into your chosen program.
It can seem scary at first :)  But as promised, I will be here to help, customise, support...anything! to 
make the process as smooth as possible.  Thankyou

It is a handbag, but the strap is long enough, so you can also wear it on your shoulder.
The distressed leather makes every bag unique and beautiful and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.
The bag is lined and it has a pocket for quick-access items, where you can keep your keys, your phone and other small things that we normally lose in the abyss of our bags.
Perfectly for a daily walk and for a business meeting, it is largely enough to carry a 13 inch laptop, a tablet, an agenda and a book.
