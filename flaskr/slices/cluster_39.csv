961,Vintage Early Laurel Burch 1970s Rare NOS Cloisonné Enamel Leopard Cat Pierced Earrings Sterling Silver 24k Gold Wash,"
            These vintage 1970s early Laurel Burch new old stock cloisonné enamel pierced earrings feature a leopard cat in a sterling silver 24k gold wash setting.  The enamel colors are Turquoise, Amethyst, Light Rose, Alabaster, Citrine and Jet.  
The earrings measure approximately 1 1/2"" in length by 7/8"" in width.  They are marked SILVER.  Her early pieces were not named and only had an inventory number.  This pair is number 5951.  
The earrings were designed by Laurel Burch and handmade by Chinese artisans before the much more common Laurel Burch pieces later made in Taiwan. 
These rare earrings are in excellent condition and are a wonderful treasure to add to any collection. 
Thank you for viewing my offerings!
NOTE: I am offering pieces of my extensive early Laurel Burch collection.  I have discovered there are unscrupulous sellers offering items as ""early Laurel Burch"" that are, in fact, not.   Chinese pieces made prior to Laurel Burch's partnership were made with the same materials, and quite possibly by the same artisan.  For one to label all Chinese pieces as Laurel Burch is misleading and dishonest.  Collectors please beware!  
Below is helpful information from Laurel's catalog on caring for these treasures.  I used the recommended Tarn-x for cleaning tarnish and it worked extremely well.  I used Tarn-x on a Q-Tip and dabbed it gently on the front and back side of a brooch, rinsed in warm water, and repeated this process several times.  The piece looked brand new!  I hope you find it useful, too.
TAKING CARE OF YOUR EARRINGS
Laurel, Inc. enamel earrings are an exciting blend of contemporary style and far eastern craft.  Each earring is hand enameled on vermeil, in China, using techniques unique to that country.
As each piece is hand worked, there will sometimes be slight differences in coloration. These should not be viewed as imperfections but rather as your assurance of their individuality.
We offer the following suggestions for the care of Laurel, Inc. earrings.
The enamel itself is a thin layer of glass on the surface of the earring. It should be treated very gently and never bent as that could lead to its cracking or shattering.
Fixed earwires and posts are soldered to the earring. The juncture itself must never be bent as this could cause the earwire to separate from the earring. If adjustment must be made, always be sure to support the top of the wire while bending the end portion.
Those earwires which are an actual part of the earring design should be adjusted, if necessary, by moving the wire from side to side. They should never be moved up and down as this could loosen the solder.
Earwires that are hinged are designed to allow enough movement for easy insertion into the ear. The hinge should never be forced. 
As silver is a relatively soft metal excessive manipulation and adjustment should be avoided.
To clean the earrings (both silver and vermeil) we recommend using a silver cleaning solution, such as Tarn-x. The earring should be first quickly dipped in the solution. It should then be carefully washed in warm water and mild detergent to remove any residue of the dip. If a piece is badly tarnished this procedure should be repeated. Dry gently and your earring will be good as new. We do not recommend the use of rough cloths for cleaning vermeil.        ",200.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1970s

2146,VIntage Dick Bruna Miffy Wooden Coat Peg Made in England 1990's New in Box | Children's Coat Hook | Nursery Hook,"
            A very cute Dick Bruna wooden coat peg, still brand new & sealed in the box.
Copyright 1979 / 1991.  Made in England.
The second picture shows the coat hook. 
The back of the box states 3 items that are available in the line and the same packaging was used for all 3 items. This box contains the coat peg only.
The box is a little squished but the coat peg is like new inside :) A lovely gift idea!
As it is still in the packaging it is a little hard to measure but it looks like approx. 14.5cm wide x 13.5cm high at the moon area.        ",17.10,4.9679,"Vintage item

I have sold all the rhinestone and do not all that are shown. I have about 7 styles left and if you order several listings there will be duplicates because my variety is limited.
I think it's a lot of fun for 1 each,  sold ""grab bag"" style. That means you won't know which ones you will get. I want you to be happy so I will try my best to send a great mix.I will be sure to add one  that I think is great, one with enamel, and a mix of the other three.

3222,"Coach skinny flight bag, made in NYC, black Coach purse, skinny flight tote, organizer bag, Coach NYC, vintage Coach collectible bags","
            Vintage Coach skinny flight bag in black leather. Made in NYC.
A great organizer bag with outside pockets on each side, chunky brass top zipper, and sturdy handles.  Inside the main compartment, a hanging pocket for small items. Brass feet on the bottom protect your bag. You can take this with you on the plane and actually have room for your feet!
Made in the original Coach factory in New York City, with the unique registration number of 136-9430. Coach made different variations for their flight bags, some with detachable straps, or , like this one, with two straps attached on square rings.  I like how they move smoothly out of the way when you unzip the bag.
Nice vintage condition, with some minor scratches on the leather surfaces. The brass finish on the strap rings has gone to silver - they're otherwise in good shape. There is normal wear on the brass feet, as you'd expect.  I note a pale mark from long ago on the bag's interior.  This bag is clean, and has been gently washed and reshaped, then conditioned with silicone-free and petroleum free leather conditioners, to enhance the longevity of your leather.
Dimensions: 12"" wide, 9"" tall.  3.5"" deep at the base.  Strap drop: 9.5""

4902,Capricorn Zodiac Vintage Good Luck Collectable Coins/Tokens (Not US Currency),"
            This is an CAPRICORN zodiac gold tone coin/token that came from an old military supply store. These coins were bought by soldiers in the 1940's and early 50's to carry in their pockets for good luck. These tokens are not spendable currency, but are unique collectables from the 1940's and 50's. Each coin is in an envelope that describes each zodiac symbol as shown by the photos. The envelopes, due to their age, show some signs of wear. Some envelopes have small folds and tears. Each envelope is marked with ""Copyright 1949 Roy G. Booker & Co. 1112 Peachtree St., Atlanta, GA.""
The CAPRICORN card has the following on the envelope:
""Your Astrological Reading, Dec 23 - Jan 20
The astrological reading is on each envelope.
These are the last 6 capricorn tokens that I have access to for my site.
The front of the goldtone coin has a relief of a woman and a goat. The back of the coin has the phrase ""You are Self Reliant""  and an image of a four leaf clover and a horseshoe.
Each coin is the size of a US quarter as shown in the photo. Quarter is shown for size only.

6166,"Pet Chew Sticks, 5 Choices of Baked Fruit Wood, Rodent Chew Toy, Rat Chinchilla Guinea Pig Supply, Pear, Blueberry, Grape, Blackberry, Apple","
            Choose between five varieties of all natural baked fruit wood sticks for your rodent to chew on. Rodents have teeth that never stop growing so you must provide them with safe and healthy chews to keep their teeth worn down and provide an outlet for their natural instincts and energy. 
There are 6 chew sticks per bundle in the single flavor orders. 
There are 10 sticks total in the assorted bundle - two of each variety. 
These 4"" to 7"" slow baked wood sticks are apple, blackberry, pear, blueberry and grape. The blackberry canes have been stripped of thorns. All of these sticks were cut from fresh, live, healthy wood; no downed, diseased, or old dead wood is ever used.  
Chinchilla and rat experts recommend BAKED wood chews to eliminate the threat of passing along bacteria, diseases, and germs to your caged pet, which may not be immune to wild-borne pathogens or illnesses. 
Please check all photos to see these beautiful varieties. Your order may appear different as baked fruit wood bark can vary in color and texture from harvest to harvest. 
Thickness varies from very thin - under 1/4"" , up to 1/2"" in diameter and you will receive an assortment of sizes unless you specify if your pet prefers thinner or thicker chew sticks.
They were hand trimmed from organically grown trees and berry bushes in New Hampshire. None of these trees or bushes have ever been sprayed or had any sort of chemicals or pesticides applied. They were cut with hand clippers - no chainsaws, gasoline, exhaust fumes, oil, or power tools have ever contacted these sticks.  
The mixed fruit wood sticks are all natural, without any added flavorings, dyes, or scents. Food coloring is a chemical additive that is not good for you - why would you give it to your pet? 
You can choose your pet's favorite varieties and will receive 6 chew sticks. Try all five varieties, or get an assortment, and get a break on shipping as each additional bundle adds only 25 cents in shipping.

6245,"Fleece booties, multiple sizes, quality made dog and cat booties,canvas patch, good traction, warm, multiple colors and multiple sizes","
            Please: Before placing the order for booties, have the exact measurements so you can order the correct size. If you need help , let me know. As all sales on booties are final
   These booties will give your pooch the warmth and traction they need when going outside and for that matter when you need to protect your hard wood floors, these booties work great. I  have even had customers that use these for some protection on very warm pavement, plus it gives added cushion so the pets won't get cuts  and various other issues while out. I have customers that tell me they put booties on the pooch so they don't bring in alot of dirt. Just take them off when they come back in the house.If you have looked over the description of the booties and noticed that I included cats, you weren't reading a misprint, I have made booties for cats, and the customers have been ecstatic! The chart I use as a guide is as follows:
                      itty bitty 3/4""-1"" x 2""-3 1/4""
                      xx-small1 1/4""-1 1/2"" x 3 1/2""-4 1/4""
                      x-small-1 3/4""-2"" x 4 1/2""-5""
                       small-2 1/4"" x 5 1/4""-5 1/2""
                        medium-2 1/2""-2 3/4"" x 5 3/4""-6 1/4""
                         
I will not guarantee a proper fit without the exact measurements.
Remember, I only use this as a guide, when you order and you need a slight variation we will design the ideal booty for your pooch (or cat). The width is most important when choosing the size and will dictate the price. If you have any questions, please contact me. Thank you for your patronage.
   Please remember to protect your pet's pads in any inclement weather.
When ordering the booties, give me the width and length of the paws that you require for your pet, not just the size, so I can create the correct booties. Without the exact measuremets, I can not guarantee a proper fit.
FYI: When ordering please make sure of measurements as all sales are final.        ",13.00,4.9762,"Handmade item

            Snuffle carpet ""Sniffy"" in the colors of your choice
Sniffy the snuffle mat is different! It´s not knotted but sewn which makes it much more stable, no plastic or rubber pad but very robust outdoor fabric is the base for  Sniffy the snuffle mat. We use high-quality fleece from the clothing industry, no cheap, thin fleece blankets that wear out too quickly. Hundreds of fleece strips were sewn here close together with a special stitch. Our Rhodesian Ridgeback girl has already tested her sniffing carpet extensively and found to be highly recommended.
Just watch this Video to see how it works:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk19ygpcZ3M
Instructions:
Place some food on the carpet, move the fleece strips so that they slide down. Your dog watches and waits for his signal to start searching.
What food can you use?
the normal dry food, Treats, small pieces of vegetables (carrot, apple) cheese cubes etc.
What your dog will learn:
Patience, he must wait quietly until you have prepared the snufffle mat.
Use its nose, all dogs love this
Slower eating, swallow up to fast is not possible here.
Snuffle carpet ""Sniffy"" is washabel in the mashine by 40 degrees
Please watch your dog by using the snuffle mat to prevent the dog destroyes it
The sniffing carpet will be made  immediately after your order. If you prefer different colors please contact me for your wishes (up to 3 colors) by the ""Contact Shop Owner"" button .

••• HOW LONG DO THEY LAST?
ahh, yes. the eternal question. although i can't predict how long they will last on each individual person, i usually like to give a range between 2-6 days, depending on placement  other factors. the gold and silver tattoos seem to last a bit longer than the flat colors, probably because of the mystical metallic glittery magic.. or something. care instructions are provided with your purchase to help you get the most out of your happytatts.
••• A NOTE ABOUT SENSITIVE SKIN:
i'm a fair-skinned little blonde girl who is allergic to certain kinds of metal and will burn if i'm in the sun for more than 15 minutes without sunscreen. these tattoos DO NOT affect me. i wear them. i love them. i freak out my family, friends, and coworkers on a regular basis. it's great fun. all that being said, i DO NOT make the claim that these tattoos will not affect YOUR sensitive skin. if you have a history of problems with temporary tattoos or adhesive, please purchase at your own risk. oh yeah, and please don't sue me if you get a rash, okay? thanks. you're lovely. and if you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to contact me.

It is really good working, we know the best quality for white inks is bleed proof white, but absolutely frankly I'm using now our white inks in my everyday work and I'm very happy about it. Shake well before using, the inks are water soluble if it seems too thick, but be careful if you add to much water the ink will become transparent, if you have overdone with water, let the jar stay still for a while so that the pigment lay down to the bottom and the carefully pour out extra liquid.

✨Gypsy Sparkle gives you a Caribbean blue water that has millions of glistening sparkles while swirling in your bath. The topping is a colorful mixture of fragrant infused Epsom Salts and cosmetic glitters.  Gypsy Sparkle Bath Bombs are designed with a flatter bottom so that they spin and float once they are dropped into your bath tub. The fizzies spin the bath water and cosmetic glitter, it is mesmerizing and beautiful. The Epsom salt may need a little time to melt and dissolve. 
✨Gypsy Sparkle is made with an opulent blend of high quality shea butters, salt from the Dead Sea, and essential oils. Your water will be as blue as the tropics! These fizzing bombs will nourish your skin and make you smell amazing!
✨THESE BATH BOMBS MAY leave a color ring on bath tub and powder sediment at the bottom; however, it will not stain if you wipe down as soon as you are finished bathing, the oils from the bath bombs will help wipe with ease. I use a slice of loofah sponge, it works great and won't scratch the tub. You can also use Softscrub, Ajax,  Comet, 409, or Spic&Span that also works well. 
✨Please be cautious stepping into and out of the bath tubs as these bombs contain oils and water softeners that may cause slippery.
Find us on Instagram and you just might receive a message that you won free bath bombs!

7638,"Organic Lavender Sachets in muslin bags, grown in the Pacific Northwest United States, set of 4 for 5 dollars","
            This is fresh and fragrant organic lavender, grown in the Pacific Northwest United States.  If your only experience with lavender is with the stale imported-from-France variety you are in for a real treat!
 
This listing is for 4 cotton muslin bags as pictured.  The selling price is only 5 for a set of 4 bags.
The cotton muslin bags are also made in the USA.  I hand-rinse the muslin bags to remove any starch so that a 3"" x 4"" bag generally shrinks 1/4"" in length and width.
These will be delightfully aromatic for a long, long time -- to scent your drawers and closets, to repel moths from your knits and yarn, to freshen your car, or use in your own home crafts!
 The muslin pouches are shipped individually sealed in cellophane wrappers to ensure product freshness.
Makes a great rustic wedding favor!

Acceptable Application Surfaces
•Glass
•Metals (Must be painted with a smooth, glossy enamel.)
•Vehicles (Must be painted with a smooth, glossy enamel.)
•Vinyl (Such as Banners, Canopies, flags, etc.)
•Plastic
•Fiberglass (Must be painted with a smooth, glossy enamel.)
•Wood (Must be painted with a smooth, glossy enamel.)
•Other Painted Surfaces (Paint must be smooth and glossy, vinyl will not stick to oxidized, faded, or peeling paint)
Not Recommended Surfaces
•Cement
•Raw Lumber
•Oxidized or faded paint
•Peeling paint
•Rubber
•Raw Metals
•Oily Surfaces
These lists are not comprehensive and there are other acceptable and unacceptable substrates than those listed above. Again, when in doubt, apply the rule that states vinyl will generally adhere well to hard, smooth, glossy and clean surfaces.
*DIFFERENCES IN MATTE AND GLOSS VINYL*
Gloss vinyl has a glossy finish and matte vinyl has a flat finish. As a general rule, matte is for indoor use and gloss is for outdoor use. You can use matte vinyl outdoors, but it will not stick as long as gloss vinyl, and you can use gloss vinyl indoors but it has a sticker adhesive backing and may be harder to remove from walls or other painted surfaces.
For anything that will be wet or handled regularly I recommend using gloss vinyl.        ",3.00,4.9132,"Handmade item

8809,Leather Hair Band | Ponytail Wrap | Ponytail Holder | Hair Tie,"
            -Step Up Your Favorite ""Go To"" Hairstyle!!!
-Update your look and stay comfortable at the same time with these leather ponytail holders! Our holders are stylish and sleek but so simple and versatile. 
-Best of all, you can use your own hair bands so it will always fit right and when the elastic breaks you can just slip it out of the leather and put a new one in!!! 
 
-You can order them 2"" (for finer to medium hair thicknesses or wearing half up), 3"" (for medium to thick hair) or 4"" (for thick hair or wrapping around the base of your bun).  Each band comes 1"" wide standard. This listing includes one coordinating elastic band.
I prefer the 3"" length, it wraps all the way around and the ends nearly meet underneath my ponytail.     
For reference: My hair is approximately the same diameter as a US quarter or 1"" when I have it all pulled back.

8848,"SAMPLE Exfoliating Rose Face Toner, All Natural Skincare, Facial Toner, Rose Water Toner, Organic Toner, Exfoliator, Antiaging Skincare","
            **One-ounce sample size of the Exfoliating Rose Toner.**
This powerful tonic is so much more than just a toner. If you're looking for an all-natural way to experience less breakouts, smoother skin, and an overall refreshed and brighter look with the appearance of smaller pores, look no further. Just check out our customer reviews!
""The BEST EVER! Im obsessed!!! You will be too! Ive searched high and low for years for the perfect skin care- and this toner is simply divine!"" - Sara
Unlike normal toners, this unique formulation works to clear off dead skin cells that intensify fine dry lines and blocked pores, while using its antimicrobial properties to clear away those pesky blemishes and keep them at bay. 
This toner is formulated with a hefty amount of willow bark extract. The extract is naturally-sourced salicylic acid, but comes with none of the drawbacks commonly associated with its use, primarily irritation. As such, it is a safe way to reap the benefits of a ß-hydroxy acid, which enhances skin cell turnover by promoting exfoliation resulting in a general improvement in the appearance of the skin and a smoothing effect with accompanying reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. With its antimicrobial properties, it's useful as a remedy for problem skin conditions, including blemishes.
The addition of aloe vera juice, geranium rose essential water, and chamomile extract helps to soothe and cool the skin, and reduce inflammation and redness. Organic licorice root extract works to brighten the skin and increase luminosity naturally, while ameliorating age spots and irregular skin pigmentation. You'll also enjoy the excellent anti-aging protection of organic ginger root extract due to its ability to almost totally inhibit collagen degradation, as well as its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Finally, add in the punch of even MORE powerful antioxidant and anti-aging protections from the organic green tea and goji berry extracts, and you've got a true skin powerhouse! 
Gentle enough to use on all skin types, including acne-prone skin - young to mature. This might just be the last toner you'll ever need. It is always recommended that you do a patch test before using all over face (especially if you have very sensitive skin).
Directions: Apply in the evening after cleansing. Shake gently before each use. Apply small amount to cotton ball and wipe gently across face and neck. Do not rinse. Allow to sit and dry for at least 15 minutes before following up with moisturizer. 
Ingredients (in alphabetical order):
- Aloe Vera Juice
- [Organic] Chamomile Extract
- Geranium Rose Essential Water
- [Organic] Ginger Root Extract
- [Organic] Goji Berry Extract
- [Organic] Green Tea Extract
- Leucidal Liquid (radish root ferment filtrate [certified organic preservative])

""All I can say is WOW! This stuff is amazing! I was so excited when I got it by the colour alone-its a dark, earthy dusky, rose hue. The toner did not just evaporate when I put it on, nor did it sit on my skin with a sticky residue-it sunk into my skin. It immediately left my skin resurfaced, clear and soft-everything a toner should do and more. A couple days after I started using it, my skin is brighter, more even toned, more smooth and taught, and over all more HAPPY!! The smell is anything but medicinal or overly perfume-y: it is full of heady, earthy ROSES-my favourite go to for my face and skin because of its healing properties! I love this toner and I will be buying it forever!"" - Vanessa
""Jessica obviously put thought and care into this product. Not only does it smell delightful and feel refreshing, but it actually WORKS! I experience mild rosacea, and this is the first toner that has truly reduced my redness. Additionally, my skin feels more elastic and supple, and my husband even commented that my skin looked nice. I absolutely will be back for more, as this has become a necessary daily component of my skin care routine."" - Bekah
""Love this product! I had been experiencing a stubborn breakout on my chin for a few months and tried a couple products before i purchased this one on a whim. I've been using it for about two weeks now and now there's not a blemish in sight! And my face feels noticeably softer and smoother. Oh yeah -- and it smells amazing!"" - Jacqueline
""I knew, or rather hoped, I was going to love this based on all the other reviews and I'm so glad I settled on getting it! It's so wonderful after a cleanse, it doesn't try out my skin or make it feel tight. It actually makes my skin feel supple and soft and I can already tell a different in texture after just a few days using it. Very impressed and want to try all your other toners now as well! :D"" - Sarah

9001,Joy Natural Products Sleep Tight Night Cream,"
            When I asked a friend how she had virtually no wrinkles at 60 years old, she responded ""I've made my own face cream for years."" That discussion followed by months of research and many recipes later helped us refine and tune until we created this perfected lotion. Our skin smoothie lotions are our signature product at Joy Natural products. We call it a skin smoothie because it feels like your skin is taking a nourishing drink.  One thing that makes us unique is we don't add water to our lotion base, we instead add aloe vera for added skin benefit. 
INGREDIENTS: Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Almond Oil, Organic Beeswax, 100% Pure Aloe Vera Gel, Lavender and Fennel Theraputic Grade Essential Oils.
USE: We recommend using this face cream in the evenings. The lotion has no preservatives so is used best within 2-3 months of purchase date. 
ESSENTIAL OILS: We only use high quality and certified doTERRA Essential oils. The essential oils used are fennel and lavender for anti-aging and calming properties, perfect for a great night cream. If are buying a 4oz glass bottle and would like Rebecca to help you craft an oil blend specific to your needs, we are also happy to do that for only 2 more. We can not create custom scents for the 1 oz sample. 
SIZES: We offer a 1 oz sample size, a 4 oz glass bottle, and a 4 oz refill. The 1 oz sample is shipped in a small plastic container. The 4 oz refill is shipped in a plastic sandwich bag to allow you to easily cut the corner and squeeze the lotion into another container or to refill our current 4 oz glass container. 
PAIRING: As shown in the final picture, we recommend pairing this with our day cream, which has the same basic ingredients but with non-nano zinc (estimate spf 10-15). We chose an invigorating peppermint and wild orange blend for our morning smoothie to help you feel alert and awake.
This lotion is one of a kind. We hope you enjoy it and are happy to answer any questions!

Body Butter Care:
Body Butters are sensitive to extreme temperatures and best stored in a cool, dry place. During warmer shipping months, your lotion may arrive in a semi-melted state. 
Simply place in the fridge for 10 – 15 minutes and stir gently to restore to its original form. Blends containing vanilla fragrance oils may discolor to a light tan color. It is a natural side effect of vanilla and does not effect the quality or stability of the product.        ",5.00,4.9298,"Handmade item

HOW IT'S MADE
Each hand-crafted batch of this nail and cuticle cream takes nearly two months to create.
First, we double sun-infuse pure jojoba oil with skin-nurturing calendula, comfrey, and lemon balm, a process that takes several weeks. Next, we infuse the oil yet again, this time with nail-intensive and anti-fungal herbs. We combine the resulting oil with organic, unrefined shea butter, rosehip seed oil, and a touch of beeswax, and warm it just to the melting point. Finally, we stir in the essential oils, and pour the cuticle cream into its containers to cool. 
NOTE: This stuff is just herbs and tradition, folks, and I'm not a doctor. Our nail & cuticle salve is sold under the FDA category of 'cosmetic' -- a nail care product -- and not as medical treatment.

----------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS
Unrefined Shea Butter: Pure, unrefined, certified organic shea butter, hand-picked and expeller pressed from whole shea nuts. The first choice in natural skin care, unrefined shea butter nourishes your cuticles, and forms a breathable, water-resistant film to protect them from damage all day long. 
Jojoba / Meadowfoam Seed Oil: Meadowfoam seed oil and jojoba oil are very similar in consistency, absorbability, and health-related qualities, and are both prized for their ability to rejuvenate and support skin and nails. Both are native to North America.
Rosehip Seed Oil: The essential fatty acids in rosehip seed oil nourish both the cuticle and nail bed. Roses can be found worldwide, including in our own garden. 
Beeswax: A natural hydrating ingredient that increases essential moisture. 
Herbs and Essential Oils: Calendula, comfrey, and lemon balm are each known for their exceptional skin-healing properties. Horsetail grass provides silica, which promotes strong nails. Orange and tea tree oil are strongly anti-fungal and anti-bacterial, helping to heal any underlying nail problems.

9492,Chemistry Crayon Labels - set of 24,"
            Children play and draw with crayons practically every day, so why not make the experience more educational? This listing is for a set of 24 labels to stick in the crayons in a basic 24 pack of crayons so that while children are coloring, they are also exposed to the names of chemicals that will make those colors! So instead of thinking ""I want green"" they will think ""I want Barium Nitrate Ba(NO3)2 Flame"" and then when they take chemistry in high school and their teacher sets some gas on fire and it makes a green color and they ask the class what chemical it was your student will know it was Barium! Genius!
Add a chemistry card!
http://www.etsy.com/shop/QueInteresante?section_id=7660072
Included: Set of 24 stick on colored labels (to blend in to crayon label)
Sheet with information about which chemical goes with which color and a chemistry lesson for the non-chemical person
*Crayons and card NOT included
~Sometimes the labels stick really well and other times they don't. I'm not sure what affect this but sorry if you're unsatisfied with how well they stick....tape will always solve the problem!
**QueInteresante recomends that you purchase Crayola® crayons to go with the labels.
***The color slightly shifts to the next label so there is about 1mm to cut off to get rid of the other color. I've found this unavoidable!
~~These crayon labels have been featured on GIZMODO, various other science/educational blogs, and the 9/27/10 issue of Chemical and Engineering News.

            This listing is for 1 Marble Maze's are great fun. Perfect for church, Dr.'s office, quiet books, great to tuck into a diaper bag or purse.
Please choose the color you would like in the pull down section when ordering
Marble mazes are made with very soft fleece fabric.
We have 2 different marble mazes this listing is for design #1 see our listing for design #2
https://www.etsy.com/listing/203713386/fleece-marble-maze-2-educational-game?
Object is Move the marble from one of the maze to another without running into a dead end!
Kids love moving the marble though the maze. It is great for young children and improving their finger dexterity. 
Our marble mazes are made on embroidery machine so all of the seams are sewn multiple times, which makes the marble very secure inside the maze but children should still be supervised.
Mazes are 5""X7"" 
We can make them in any color you like, they can also be one color on one side and another color on the other side, just put your color choices in the ""notes to seller"" section.
****We have a lot of designs that haven't been listed in the store yet. check out our ""My store"" boards on Pinterest . If you find something you like email me, I would love to make it for you.

10127,Fidget Spinner Tri Blade EDC Fidget Toy,"
            Get in on the newest EDC craze with your own fidget spinner tri-blade. This version has a textured face on one side and smooth face on the other. Three bearings surround the center bearing. Printed in PLA and fit with the bearings of your choice.
See them in action here: https://youtu.be/iTBc0Z-MuR8
All options include a free set of finger caps (two pieces) for one bearing matching the spinner color. The bearings and finger caps are NOT glued in place, but are pressure fit very snug. The finger pads can be removed, but due to the pressure fit, the center peg of the finger cover may break off during removal. 
WHAT'S INCLUDED
* DIY Kit-NO BEARINGS!
Includes only the body and one set (2 pieces) matching caps (you must add your own bearings!) This IS NOT a complete spinner.

HELP ME CHOOSE
All of the bearings will spin better after a break-in period of normal use. Each step up increases the maximum spin time. See the video comparison of the bearing options here: https://youtu.be/iTBc0Z-MuR8
* Steel
The basic carbon steel bearings will spin unassisted for the least amount of time. If you just want something to constantly spin, the standard carbon steel bearings may be good for you.
* Bones Redz
This is a premium steel bearing made famous in the skateboard industry. Very quiet and smooth spinning.
* Yellow Jacket
Very similar spin times to hybrid ceramic bearings but with less cost. Very quiet and smooth spinning, better spin times than Bones Redz.
* Full Ceramic
The smoothest and longest spinning bearing you can buy! The full ceramic construction enables the least amount of friction.
*Note: Colors may vary slightly due to computer monitor settings. The photos shown were taken in natural daylight to get the most accurate color representation as possible.

            Orgone cell phone devices have a self-adhesive backing to attach to your cell phone or any small electrical device.  They are made up of Eco friendly resin, crushed quartz crystal, with copper, silver,  brass or aluminum particles. EcoPoxy® is a safe, Environmentally Friendly, Low Odor, Plant based Epoxy Casting Resin. Needs no ventilation. Certified Green and eco-friendly resin. Each piece at least includes copper, brass and clear quartz crystals. They are around 3/4"" diameter and 3/16"" deep. About the diameter of a nickel. The rounded shiny surface helps it to slide easily into your pocket or purse. It has a concave surface beneath so that the 3M two way tape is hidden.  They are very lightweight and the quartz crystal is crushed so that it cannot be seen. The glitter is for color. Each piece is handmade separately and can differ slightly from the photos. Colors in photos can differ depending on the lighting and your monitor. I can send you a photo of the actual pieces before mailing to you if you like. Charged with Reiki.  Choose from 4 colors: black, gold, turquoise, or purple. Or choose a gift set of 8 of my color choice to save 2.00. 
The set of 10 gold are 1"" in diameter.
Clear Quartz crystals are the supreme gift of Mother Earth. Even the smallest is imbued with the properties of a master healer teacher. Wearing, carrying or meditating with a Clear Quartz crystal can open the mind and heart to higher guidance, allowing the realm of Spirit to be transmitted and translated into the world of physical form.
Clear Quartz also amplifies any intent that is programmed into it and can allow the crystal to hold a pattern of energy long enough and strongly enough for the manifestation of a goal to occur.
Energetically charged with Reiki.
Orgone devices are a matrix made of resin, metals and quartz crystals known to strengthen the body's energy field, intending to protect from man-made EMF radiation and negative energy. These metaphysical tools have been known to help improve life physically, emotionally and spiritually.
About Orgone Energy: 
Orgone is s also known as “Qi”, ""Chi"", “Prana”, “Ether” and “Akasha”. It is a universal life-force energy which permeates all matter on earth. Orgone can exist in a positive, healthy form, as well as a stagnant, harmful form, often caused by modern technologies that emit EMF radiation. The side-effects of being surrounded by stagnant orgone energy can include depression, anxiety, sleep problems, allergies, and other physical and mental health issues.
Dr Wilhelm Reich, an Austrian psychiatrist, researched orgone energy in the earlier half of the 20th century. He found that organic materials attracted and held orgone energy, while non-organic metal materials attracted and rapidly repelled orgone energy. Today’s orgone devices are built on these two principles. As a mix of organic resin and inorganic metal shavings, that purportedly simultaneously attract and repel stagnant orgone energy, producing a “scrubbing” effect which re-charges the stagnant energy. It was later discovered that adding quartz crystals to this matrix efficiently collects, transmutes, and emits positive energy. This encased quartz crystal which has a piezoelectric effect (it produces a small electric charge when put under pressure) adds to the energy-cleansing effect.
The properties or attributes of any stone or orgone are metaphysical in nature & do not claim to heal or cure. They are not meant to take the place of standard medical or psychological treatment, but to accompany & work alongside with it.

11336,Gordon Ramsay Colouring Book,"
            This is a very adult colouring book, indeed! Featuring 24 pages of Gordon Ramsay's killer phrases and scenes from his many television appearances.
This colouring book is A5 (approximately 21cm x 15cm) sized and perfect for any fan of the foul-mouthed chef. The paper weight is 160gsm so is ideal for coloured pencils. 
It can also be colouring in with felt-tip pens although I will warn to be careful not to flood the paper with ink as it may run through to the back of the page, and as they are double-sided may potentially ruin the other image.
Processing time is approximately 1-2 weeks as each is individually printed, although I will aim to get them send out as soon as possible.
Warning: unsuitable for children due to foul, adult language!

Aluminum is a soft metal, so naturally it will acquire small scratches and nicks. These are not imperfections, but a characteristic of the metal itself. 
This item is stamped by hand, by a human! Though we try our best to keep our stamping straight and consistent, it is impossible to make it 100% perfect. The nature of hand stamping is that letter spacing, depth and placement will vary.
Bookmark measures about 5 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Your bookmark comes with your choice of color ribbon or bamboo cord.
How to order:
Please read shop policies before purchasing - many important FAQs can be answered there!
1. Choose your ribbon color
2. In the ""notes to seller"" box at checkout, please leave us a note on what name and date you want stamped onto the bookmark
Please be very specific, as we will stamp your message exactly as you have it, including spelling and capitalization.

11452,"Personalised book mark, stamped Aluminium, customised copper bookmark, readers gift, book lover, tassel, brass bookmark, Christmas present","
            This is a beautiful Hand-stamped Aluminium, copper or brass book mark, stamped with your favorite greeting, quote or just a cheeky message and finished with a cotton tassel in the colour of your choice.
This bar measures approx 150mm x 12mm and can be personalised with anything you wish.  Please send us a message with your choice of words, please do check spellings, we will stamp exactly as it is sent to us.
We can fit a maximum of 45 characters (including spaces & grammar) per bookmark. 
Please note that these items are hand-stamped meaning that I stamp each letter one at a time, so each letter will have varying degrees of depth, alignment & unpredictable spacing between them.
The process is very different from traditional engraving, which carves a light groove into the metal. Stamping is a more forceful technique, where each individual letter, number and symbol is stamped by hand, one at a time with a hammer and steel stamp. This is much deeper than engraving.
PLEASE MESSAGE ME WITH YOUR PERSONALISED DETAILS.

Please read through all policies before ordering for information on production times & FAQ.  By ordering this item you are agreeing to all of our policies.
ALUMINIUM: A soft metal that is a great price alternative to Sterling Silver. Aside from being low in cost, aluminum does not tarnish - If the metal becomes dull or dirty it can be easily wiped away with a lint free cloth / silver cloth. This soft metal, however, is not as strong as Sterling Silver & continued bending & twisting will weaken the metal & inevitably break.
COPPER: A hard metal that has a lovely earthy red colour. Known for it’s possible medicinal benefits. Copper can cause slight green discoloration of the skin, this is due to the metal reacting to the natural acids in your skin & the oxygen in the air. As Copper does oxidize quickly, it often has a darker appearance, which can be removed easily with a Copper cloth / Sunshine Cloth / Pro Polish Pad to reveal its beautiful red finish.
BRASS: An alloy metal with a small percentage of Copper. It is this small amount of copper that gives brass its deep golden colour, this can also cause slight skin discolouration however brass is one of the hardest metals we use for bracelets.        ",8.62,4.9056,"Handmade item

Amy Style calligraphy is the newest member of the printable Learn Calligraphy for a Latté series. The straight up-and-down slant of the Amy makes it an enjoyable, frustration-free style to learn. The Amy requires only a straight pen and a nib {I recommend the Nikko G}; no oblique holder is necessary! This intuitive printable worksheet set will be a dream come true for those who have never attempted calligraphy before; and it's also perfect for the experienced calligrapher looking to practice a new, modern style.
This printable Amy Style Premium Calligraphy Worksheet Set includes the following pages {27 total}:
- Illustrated Supply List
- How to Create Faux Calligraphy in the Amy Style
- Faux Calligraphy Letter Formation Practice Sheets {Uppercase Letters, Lowercase Letters, Numbers; with built-in ghost tracer letters}
- Dip Pen Calligraphy in the Amy Style
- Explanation of Dip Pen Calligraphy Strokes
- Stroke Practice
- Dip Pen Pen Calligraphy Letter Formation Practice Sheets {Uppercase Letters, Lowercase Letters, Numbers, Symbols – includes slant lines}
- Word Practice 
- *NEW*: 4-Page Additional Word Practice of Common Words
- Stroke Reference Sheets
- General Practice Sheet
Due to Etsy's file upload imitations, I have split the worksheet into two separate files. Print out part I first, then part II second. You will need a PDF reader to properly view and print the worksheet set. If you do not already have one, you can download Adobe Acrobat for free here: https://get.adobe.com/reader/
*Please note that the Calligraphy for a Latté series is available for personal use only. Your patronage helps me to continue to offer these sheets at such a great price! So, please, if you want to give a copy to a friend, pay for that copy. For other use {e.g. classroom}, please contact me.        ",5.00,4.9388,"Handmade item

14302,1/4 oz cosmetic mica in jars/Soap colorant/Nail art/Candle colorant/46 colors to choose from/Buy four get one FREE,"
            This listing is for 1/4 oz of our mica pigments. Each mica will come in a jar and buy four get one for FREE. Meaning if you purchase 4 1/4 oz micas, you will get 1 additional 1/4 oz mica for free. The free item will be automatically added when we process your order, no additional move is needed. Please list your choice of colors in the note during check out. You can even choose the color for the free mica. If you do not indicate colors, we will be happy to choose them for you and it will be a good assorted colors.
We added a few new additions. 
Red Mauve is a color close to Burgundy but more on the violet side. 
Gold is a fine mica, close to our previous Gold shade, but darker. 
Fall is a green gold color. It may look like a green color, but it has a golden shimmer.
The last picture is showing our newer micas. 
Pearly White is a more shimmery mica compared to the White mica we have been carrying. 
True Gold is a very similar shade to our Gold mica, but more shimmery, which makes it more ideal for eyeshadows and shimmery MP soaps, although it may not matter a lot for CP soaps. 
Golden Beach is a blue shade with golden shimmer. 
Cherry Blossoms is a pink shade with golden shimmer. 
Bright Violet is a brighter purple color compared to Magic Purple. The picture makes it look a little bit blue, but it is a very purple color.
Just to clarify, Carmine is just the name of the mica, instead of being carmine the pigment, so the Carmine mica in our listing is complete vegan. :)
These colorants can be used for:
Soaps
Nails
Candles
Bath Bombs
Bath salts
Lotions
Hair conditioners
Facial cream
Body butter
Eyeshadows
Lip balms
and more...
Note: Most of the blue and green colors are not safe for lips, except the mica named Blue. 
Due to the brightness of each computer (including tablets and smart phones) screen, the colors could look differently. If your project requires very restricted colors, please contact us for more detailed information. Sometimes people could have different judgement of colors, so it could be a good idea to purchase a small amount to start with, and then buy a larger amount later.
While the color of these pigments stay true in all other applications, based on our test in CP soap, 
Carmine will turn into a very light pink
Peach Pink will be a light pink brownish color 
Peacock Blue mica will turn into a more greenish blue
Orange will turn into a sort of yellow orange color
Congo Pink will turn into an orange color and we recommend adding a bit more, such as 2 tsb per pound of soap, instead of 1 tsb per pound, to get a bold color.
Magic Purple and Bright Purple will turn a greyish purple in some cold process soap recipes

14388,Woodland Animals - Clip art and Digital paper set,"
            Are you looking for cute high quality clip art images to use in your projects? You’ve come to the right place!
PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT TO READ MY PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND SHOP POLICIES BEFORE PURCHASING THIS ITEM, even if you have purchased something from my shop in the past – I know this can seem a little bit boring but once you read them, you will feel more confident about the type of product you are buying and the permitted uses for it ☺ 
This is a set of 36 .png files with transparent backgrounds (clip art) and 5 different digital paper designs. The digital papers are 8.5"" x 11"" and 12” x 12” .jpg files. You can see the content of the set and the approximate size of the clip art in the gallery images (below the main image). All these files are in high resolution (300 dpi) and watermark-free. This product is a digital item that is going to be sent to your email address. If you need the clip art images in jpg format please mention it in the “note to seller” at checkout, just keep in mind that those will have white backgrounds instead of transparent backgrounds. If you have any questions about the sizes or type of files, please feel free to contact me.
You’ll love the way you can take charge of your projects with these easy-to-use elements that can be easily arranged in any way you like. These graphics are unique, created with love and are ideal for the projects you seek to put your heart into. 
About my process: When I get started on a new set, my first step is to imagine the characters and elements I want to create. Next, I draw all of these concepts by hand the old-fashioned way using paper and pencil. After that, I digitize them so that they convert each of my original details into digital strokes so that they can be used and reproduced in any number of projects.
 
The formats used in my files (.jpg and .png) are very common and can be opened with any program that allows you to work with images. If this is the first time you are purchasing clip art images and you want to make sure that these files will work in your current setup, you can contact me to request a file sample: just send me a message mentioning it and include your email address. 
Note: DIGITAL COLLAGE SHEETS, BOTTLE CAP IMAGES and any product that resembles them are NOT allowed. You can create them for personal use, however you cannot sell them in digital format.
You can find more about the allowed uses in my policies section.
------------------------------------------
WHEN AND HOW ARE YOUR FILES GOING TO BE SENT?
------------------------------------------
Once the order is placed, you will receive an email with a link to download your files within 24 hours following the payment. When paying with checks, please note that payment frequently takes 3 – 5 business days to complete.  Unless you specify something different in the “note to seller” at checkout, I will send your items to the email registered in your Etsy account. 
I’m almost always able to send your files within a few hours or even minutes. I always send them as soon as I’m able to sit in front of my computer. However, if you urgently need your files and you are not able to wait up to 24 hours, you can contact me before purchasing my products and I’ll let you know when I’ll be able to send them so you can decide if the turnaround time is convenient for you (I promise I’ll hurry!).
If you see your order marked as “shipped” and/or if 24 hours have passed and you haven’t received your files, I recommend for you to look for the email in your spam folder. Sometimes email providers don’t realize that the email I sent you contains something really cute and that you are waiting for it and they sent it to your “not wanted” or “spam” folder. If you can’t find my email anywhere, please contact me and I’ll send it again, and, if it is necessary, I can use a different delivery method.
------------------------------------------
LICENSES 
------------------------------------------
These graphics can be used for personal and commercial purposes. In all cases you need to follow my terms of use.
The standard licenses included when you purchase this item are:
-License for personal use: Any personal project in which no profit is made.
-License for commercial use: If you have a small or home-based business, you can use any of the images you purchase in my shop in your products to sell (see permitted uses and restrictions in the policies section). With this license it is necessary to give credit to my shop with the words “Graphics by Pixel Paper Prints”. Credit needs to be placed in your product description, on the same page as the product in an easily readable fashion.
Extended licenses
-License for commercial use with no credit required: If you want to use my graphics in your products and you do not wish to credit my shop you need to purchase this permit. One license needs to be purchased for every set of graphics for which you do not want to credit my shop. The cost of it for most of my products is 20.
-Mass production license: 
This license includes all of the benefits from both the standard and extended licenses and eliminates the 1000 piece reproduction restriction. You need to purchase this license if you intend* to sell more than 1000 products using one or more elements from a single set of graphics as part of your product design (physical and/or digital). For more information on this, check out the section “Permitted uses” under “Policies”
All the licenses are non-exclusive and non-transferable.
------------------------------------------
WHAT PROGRAM DO YOU NEED TO WORK WITH THESE FILES? 
------------------------------------------
That depends on the project you want to create, but here is a list of some popular options:
-Adobe Photoshop /Photoshop elements
-Gimp (you can download this one for free at: http://www.gimp.org/ )
-Microsoft Publisher
-Microsoft Word (only for basic compositions).
-LibreOffice (Writer is a free alternative to Word). 
If this is the first time that you are working with this type of product, I will be happy to help you as much as I can and I’ll be glad to guide you towards any tutorials online that might help you with the project you have in mind, but I hope you can understand that it is not possible for me to offer training in the use of these graphics and such service is not included with your purchase. There are several really fantastic sites out there for such training. I recommend Lynda.com to gain familiarity with new software suites. 
It is really easy to manage and print these images, but if you want to be sure that you are going to be able to use them and/or if you have the necessary software/program to work with them, I can send you a sample of one of my files so you can try it and see if it works for you before buying a product, just contact me and provide me with your email address so I can send you the sample file.

If you are having a hard time removing your piece, simply put it in the freezer for a few minutes to harden your medium, then try to remove it. Works every time for me! :) 
Some mediums such as polymer clay, may be baked in your molds since they are heat safe, but my advice is to bake your piece using a lower temp. to get the piece to harden, THEN remove it and bake the rest of the way at the normal required temperature. 
                                                             about the CUPCAKE MOLD

14795,60 Sock Yarn Nuggets  - Wool Mini Skeins - 1200 Yards Total,"
            Need some variety in your scrap knitting & crocheting?  Here's a delectable collection of fingering-weight (sock) yarn designed to inspire creativity.  Maybe you have been waiting to collect a wider selection of colors to start that special scrap project, or you want to start an instant scrap stash without investing a fortune buying full-sized skeins yourself.  Now's your chance!
You get a large selection of 60 different multi-hued, 20-yard Yarn Nuggets (1200 yards total), all skeined and ready to go.  The brand new yarn used for the Nuggets can be 100% wool, or wool with a bit of nylon or bamboo, and classified as ""sock yarn"" with a gauge of 7 sts/1"" on US size 1-3 needles.  Most of the yarn is 4 ply, with a little single ply tossed in for variety.  Although most of the yarn is superwash, I recommend hand-washing your finished items in cold water and air drying for best results.  The rainbow-colored Nuggets range from simply shaded to self-patterning, self-striping, speckled and tweedy.  I handpicked this extensive collection of commercially-available yarn from around the world and it all falls in the fingering weight category.  Some of the yarn is hand painted or kettle dyed, but not by me.
You can use Yarn Nuggets in many ways, including:
     - Fiddly Bits tubular infinity scarf/cowl by Hipknitizer (on Ravelry.com & pictured above)
     - Excavation scrap blanket by Hipknitizer (on Ravelry.com)
     - the beekeeper's quilt by tiny owl knits (on Ravelry.com)
     - Monkey Jacobus by Annita Wilschut (on Ravelry.com & pictured above)
     - Zig and Zag Sock Yarn Pram Blanket by Debbie Orr (on Ravelry.com)
     - Scrappy Socky Stripey Cardi by Fawn Pea (on Ravelry.com)
     - Odds & Ends Kerchief by Giddy Davis (on Ravelry.com)
     - doll and small stuffed toy clothing
     - holiday ornaments
     - scrap socks & hat
     - baby clothing & booties
This yarn pack was carefully prepared by me in a clean, pet-free, smoke-free environment.  I select the 60 Yarn Nuggets to be as varied and interesting as possible and no two collections are exactly the same, although there might be a little overlap.        ",59.00,4.96,"Handmade Supply

            If you want your print tiled, it will repeat the print like in photo 4 with 9-4""x4"" please select the size with tiled beside it. 
This listing is Lilly Pulitzer inspired outdoor vinyl. Digitally printed on high quality vinyl, with Eco Solvent inks on a professional Roland Versa Camm wide format printer. It is waterproof and has a durability up to three to four years great for window decals and signs. If you are putting a decal on something you handle a lot, such as laptops, phones, key chains, cups. I recommend you to laminate it. It will keep it looking new and customers happy. If you apply to cups don't put in dishwasher. 
 
This vinyl can be used with any plotter. If you laminate it you may have to turn up your cutting pressure.
If you would like I can laminate the vinyl for you, just select that option in the size box. If you would like to laminate the vinyl yourself select DIY Laminate in the size box and I will put a sheet of laminate with your order. 
If you have any questions, or if you need different sizes message me. I am still working on getting the Etsy shop set up. If you have a pattern you want on vinyl contact me. 
Most orders will ship within 2-3 days. 
More patterns coming soon!!

15675,London Police Box woodworking plans |  PDF downloadable file,"
            How to build a  London Police Box.
There are 57 pages in the downloadable file, including plans,  drawings, photos, and step-by-step instructions.
It is my take on the 1929 Mackenzie Trench design police watch box, very similar to (and the same size as) the Police Watch Box that sits outside Earls Court Railway Station in London.
The police box outside Earl's Court tube station in London was built in 1997 and based on the 1929 Mackenzie Trench design.
It is not a prop.
It is a very solid structure suitable not only for show, but also for many practical uses. It is big and strong enough to be used as a garden shed to store garden tools etc., and it can be transformed into a cattery, a pool side changing shed, or any other type of quirky rendition that could be limited only by your imagination.
This is a full-size version very similar to the police box outside Earl's Court tube station in London.
The plans are written in both standard (inch) and metric (millimetre) measurements.
It is designed for outside use. The corner pillars alone could just about hold up a house.
It is made in sections that can be dismantled if it ever needs to be moved
The footprint is 1430 mm (57¼"") square and it stands 2700 mm (9 ft) tall. 
Help is in the form of user-input and the URL for the user/comments page is given in the documentation in the downloadable file.        ",5.00,4.7778,"Handmade Supply

16031,"RECYCLED Bath and Body Works 14.5 oz empty candle jars, clear / colored, with optional tops, storage, crafting, curios, supplies, gifting","
            This listing is for ONE empty, recycled ""Bath and Body Works"" 14.5 oz ""3 wick"" candle jar. You can also optionally purchase a top for the jar. These jars are great for craft storage, crafting supplies, curios, or gifting. They are also suitable for reuse as a candle-making supply - You could make your own 3-wick candles. 
The jars have been cleaned and de-labeled, and are ready for use. There are no chips or cracks on them. There may be occasional irregularities in the manufacturing of the glass such as waviness and small bubbles. There may be other minor imperfections, because they are very gently used / upcycled. I take care to inspect every jar carefully, and send only jars that are in very good condition. 
These bottles are rerouted / recycled / upcycled before they go into the trash stream and given new potential use. This makes them environmentally sound / mother loving! I believe the upcycling process helps to re-route positive energy back into the world where there could have just been trash... Love your mother, indeed!
Please NOTE: all colored jars are NOT colored glass, but the color appears to be sprayed on or painted on. This appears to be pretty common in the modern manufacturing process. I will not send colored jars with imperfections or scratches in the color on the side walls of the jars. I find it acceptable if there are minor scratches or imperfections in the coloring of the bottom. Please convo me if you are concerned about imperfections of the bottom, and I will make every effort to meet your desires.
The optional tops have a rubber seal which makes the jars pretty air-tight for storage. I would NOT consider these safe for food storage, as the rubber seals retain some of the original scent of the candle, and I expect the scent would affect the stored food. The tops have been cleaned with soapy water. 
For the tops with decorative patterns: There may be minor imperfections of the INSIDE of these tops, but I take care to offer tops that are new-looking on the outside (no scratches or dents). 
For the tops that are flat and shiny (the ones that read ""Bath and Body Works"", ""Slatkin & Co."" or ""White Barn"": These tops tend to get scratched much more easily and typically have some imperfections in the form of small scratches, especially on the flat top surface. They may occasionally have tiny areas of rust as well. I offer these at a REDUCED price given their imperfections, but I will send the best that I have :)

 Pressed Glitter EyeShadow that will make your makeup look even more gorgeous!
These are all handmade to order and inspired by glitter injections products, but for a much cheaper price. Each is a full size pan and all pans are magnetic so these are compatible with a Z Palette.
!!!PLEASE REFER TO THE SIZE REFERENCE PICTURE FOR AN IDEA OF THE SIZE. THIS IS A STANDARD SIZED SINGLE EYE SHADOW PAN (26MM). THE SAME SIZE PAN THAT MAC AND MAKEUP GEEK SELL. I HAD A BUYER LEAVE A BAD REVIEW BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY WERE EXPECTING TO RECEIVE A ""CONTAINER SIZED PRODUCT"" !!! 
I prefer to wear these in 2-3 layers for a bolder look so I would highly recommend that. Glitter glue is optional when wearing these because the product does apply and stay on WITHOUT it. 
You can refer to each color option by the names in the picture.
Because these are made to order processing time is 3-5 days.
I ship 2-3 DAY PRIORITY with tracking.

16228,Jungle Friends -Animals- Clip art and Digital paper set - Jungle clipart,"
            Are you looking for cute high quality clip art images to use in your projects? You’ve come to the right place!
PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT TO READ MY PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND SHOP POLICIES BEFORE PURCHASING THIS ITEM, even if you have purchased something from my shop in the past – I know this can seem a little bit boring but once you read them, you will feel more confident about the type of product you are buying and the permitted uses for it ☺ 
This is a set of 26 .png files with transparent backgrounds (clip art) and 3 different digital paper designs. The digital papers are 8.5"" x 11"" and 12” x 12” .jpg files. You can see the content of the set and the approximate size of the clip art in the gallery images (below the main image). All these files are in high resolution (300 dpi) and watermark-free. This product is a digital item that is going to be sent to your email address. If you need the clip art images in jpg format please mention it in the “note to seller” at checkout, just keep in mind that those will have white backgrounds instead of transparent backgrounds.
You’ll love the way you can take charge of your projects with these easy-to-use elements that can be easily arranged in any way you like. These graphics are unique, created with love and are ideal for the projects you seek to put your heart into. 
About my process: When I get started on a new set, my first step is to imagine the characters and elements I want to create. Next, I draw all of these concepts by hand the old-fashioned way using paper and pencil. After that, I digitize them so that they convert each of my original details into digital strokes so that they can be used and reproduced in any number of projects.
 
The formats used in my files (.jpg and .png) are very common and can be opened with any program that allows you to work with images. If this is the first time you are purchasing clip art images and you want to make sure that these files will work in your current setup, you can contact me to request a file sample: just send me a message mentioning it and include your email address. 
Note: DIGITAL COLLAGE SHEETS, BOTTLE CAP IMAGES and any product that resembles them are NOT allowed. You can create them for personal use, however you cannot sell them in digital format.
You can find more about the allowed uses in my policies section.
------------------------------------------
WHEN AND HOW ARE YOUR FILES GOING TO BE SENT?
------------------------------------------
Once the order is placed, you will receive an email with a link to download your files within 24 hours following the payment. When paying with checks, please note that payment frequently takes 3 – 5 business days to complete.  Unless you specify something different in the “note to seller” at checkout, I will send your items to the email registered in your Etsy account. 
I’m almost always able to send your files within a few hours or even minutes. I always send them as soon as I’m able to sit in front of my computer. However, if you urgently need your files and you are not able to wait up to 24 hours, you can contact me before purchasing my products and I’ll let you know when I’ll be able to send them so you can decide if the turnaround time is convenient for you (I promise I’ll hurry!).
If you see your order marked as “shipped” and/or if 24 hours have passed and you haven’t received your files, I recommend for you to look for the email in your spam folder. Sometimes email providers don’t realize that the email I sent you contains something really cute and that you are waiting for it and they sent it to your “not wanted” or “spam” folder. If you can’t find my email anywhere, please contact me and I’ll send it again, and, if it is necessary, I can use a different delivery method.
------------------------------------------
LICENSES 
------------------------------------------
These graphics can be used for personal and commercial purposes. In all cases you need to follow my terms of use.
The standard licenses included when you purchase this item are:
-License for personal use: Any personal project in which no profit is made.
-License for commercial use: If you have a small or home-based business, you can use any of the images you purchase in my shop in your products to sell (see permitted uses and restrictions in the policies section). With this license it is necessary to give credit to my shop with the words “Graphics by Pixel Paper Prints”. Credit needs to be placed in your product description, on the same page as the product in an easily readable fashion.
Extended licenses
-License for commercial use with no credit required: If you want to use my graphics in your products and you do not wish to credit my shop you need to purchase this permit. One license needs to be purchased for every set of graphics for which you do not want to credit my shop. The cost of it for most of my products is 20.
-Mass production license: 
This license includes all of the benefits from both the standard and extended licenses and eliminates the 1000 piece reproduction restriction. You need to purchase this license if you intend* to sell more than 1000 products using one or more elements from a single set of graphics as part of your product design (physical and/or digital). For more information on this, check out the section “Permitted uses” under “Policies”
All the licenses are non-exclusive and non-transferable.
------------------------------------------
WHAT PROGRAM DO YOU NEED TO WORK WITH THESE FILES? 
------------------------------------------
That depends on the project you want to create, but here is a list of some popular options:
-Adobe Photoshop /Photoshop elements
-Gimp (you can download this one for free at: http://www.gimp.org/ )
-Microsoft Publisher
-Microsoft Word (only for basic compositions).
-LibreOffice (Writer is a free alternative to Word). 
If this is the first time that you are working with this type of product, I will be happy to help you as much as I can and I’ll be glad to guide you towards any tutorials online that might help you with the project you have in mind, but I hope you can understand that it is not possible for me to offer training in the use of these graphics and such service is not included with your purchase. There are several really fantastic sites out there for such training. I recommend Lynda.com to gain familiarity with new software suites. 
It is really easy to manage and print these images, but if you want to be sure that you are going to be able to use them and/or if you have the necessary software/program to work with them, I can send you a sample of one of my files so you can try it and see if it works for you before buying a product, just contact me and provide me with your email address so I can send you the sample file.

Please refer to the 2nd and 5th images.
EXAMPLE 1:
- Trim or punch Glamour Sticky to the shape you need.
- Peel one side and stick the Glamour Sticky to the paper
- Remove protective backing from the other size of the Glamour Sticky and press to glass 
- Burnish to remove air pockets
- Peel and stick a second Glamour Sticky to the back of the photo paper that you just glued to the glass
- Remove second backing and stick to the pendant tray.
FINISHED!
* EXAMPLE 2:
- Trim or punch Glamour Sticky to the shape you need.
- Peel one side and stick the Glamour Sticky to the photo paper that you already glued to glass
- Remove protective backing from the other side of the Glamour Sticky and press to inside of the pendant tray.
FINISHED!
TIPS:
- I used a craft knife to help lift the protective backing from the adhesive. =)
- Use thicker paper, such as cover weight paper, when making a glass pendant in a pendant tray that has texture.

16472,"diamond texture mat, large diamond mat, small diamond mat for fondant and buttercream cake decorating","
            Two diamond texture mats to imprint a pattern on fondant or buttercream. These mats will help you make straight and even lines that you can then pipe over on buttercream, or imprint onto fondant using a rolling pin.
One mat has larger diamonds, which are about 1"" wide at the middle, and the other has smaller diamonds, which are a little over 1/2"" at the middle. Each mat is 12"" x 6"" so that it will cover the entire side of the cake as you're using it to imprint directly onto buttercream.
The mats are made from a flexible plastic and could easily be cut into a smaller shapes if you wanted to.
Each order is one of each mat, 1 larger diamond and 1 smaller diamond. They'll be shipped rolled up in a box to conserve space. Let them rest flat if they're curving when you get them, and they will flatten out after they rest a bit.

14K Gold Filled Jewelry 
Gold Fill is a thick layer of 14k solid gold, that has been bonded with another metal, usually copper or brass. When cared for correctly, due to the thick sold gold layer, 14k gold fill, unlike gold plating, will not tarnish or discolor. Your jewelry will last as long as, & will wear exactly like solid gold.

18589,"13 Colors Sailor Knot Bracelet Cotton Rope Bracelet, You Choose the Sailor Knot Color","
            Our Sailor Knot bracelets continue the nautical knot tradition we started back in 1957.  
This is the real deal.  The sailor in your life will know this is a real sailor bracelet by the custom cotton cord we use.  Designed to emulate the cable cord that was common during the age of sail up through the 1920's, this is not your ordinary bracelet.  This is not the bolo cord, braided cord, or synthetic cord that dominated the polyester age.  This is a step back to the authentic, and you deserve the best.
Our work was given an honorable mention by Martha Stewart in the 2014 American Made Summit for our Heritage Craft. Of 6,000 entries, only 4 received this honor.  You can also see these bracelets featured in television and magazines throughout the US.
This cotton bracelet is about 1.25 inches wide. Please select a size and color from the drop down menu.
Small – fits children and fineframed women with a wrist size of 5 – 6 inches
Medium – fits women and teenagers with a wrist size of 6 – 7 inches
Large – fits men and larger women with a wrist size of  7 – 8 inches
Extra Large  fits the big guys with wrists from 8-9 inches
We make these all ourselves, so if you don't see a size you want, just make a note when you check out and we'll be glad to custom make one that fits you.
Don't forget to visit our shop for the widest selection of sailor knot bracelets on Etsy.
