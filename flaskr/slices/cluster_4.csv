Here is a very cute & smart Steiff hand puppet fox complete with a beautiful bushy fox tail! His name is Smardy, he is a crafty fox out of an arithmetic book of the same name for children. Our vintage animal glove puppet was produced from 1965 to 1976. Old Steiff fox hand puppet is made of red, white & black mohair with plastic eyes. Fox’ head is stuffed with wood wool (excelsior), the sheath for the puppet player’s finger is made of plastics. Vintage Steiff hand – fox lost his chest tag, ear button & yellow Steiff label.
Old Steiff Hand - Fox measures 17 cm / 6 ¾ inches – glove only (fits to every normal sized adult hand) & 25 cm / 10 inches to his head without ears & tail.
Our cute vintage Steiff Fox Smardy hand puppet is in very good vintage condition as you can see in the photographs!
Old Steiff Hand - Fox is a real eye candy for the Steiff or shabby vintage toy collector; they are really very rare to find nowadays due to the very short time & limited number of their production!

Here comes a puppet figure (hand puppet / punch character / Kasper doll / puppet figure) with carved wooden head that looks as if it came from the workshop Lotte Sievers-Hahn (artisanal carving tradition since 1929): The KASPER.
Because the hand puppet is not labeled, I can not confirm with certainty the origin!
Condition: Age accordingly total absolute good, barely played condition (see photos)
-------
Caution! This particular product is not suitable for children under 36 months. Contains small parts.
-------
Wish you much fun with the magical puppet figure

There may be some minor imperfections but they only add authentic antique character; overall these are in outstanding condition!  
Not only can these stamps be appreciated by philatelic collectors & enthusiasts, they can also be used for decorative paper crafting, card making, collages, scrapbooking, journaling, jewelry making and more!

This board makes a beautiful and functional gift for anyone on your list.   
Details on this piece are as follows:

- Board is made from pine common board which often has unique characteristics such as knots and markings.  These marks add to the beauty and uniqueness of your piece.  Each board is sanded smooth and then stained with Espresso oil stain.   **Please be aware that different boards will react differently to the same stain and your base stain may not be EXACTLY what is shown here.**

8584,Custom Animal Crossing Amiibo,"
            Handmade, custom Animal Crossing figures with real amiibo functionality.
These adorable figures are fully compatible with Animal Crossing: New Leaf and Happy Home Designer for the 3DS, and Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival for the Wii U. All chips are tested before shipping, are region-free and can be used like any other amiibo figure/card.
ShopBHawk has handmade over 100 Animal Crossing amiibo, so you can be sure that a lot of experience and care will be put into your figure. I hand-make every amiibo from scratch, not modified retail amiibo or 3D printing. Please see the social media links on my store page for more examples.
I can make any Animal Crossing character, including NPCs, or you can choose to have just the figure without a chip (for custom designs/characters). You do NOT have to send in your card for amiibo functionality, I will provide the chip for you. Please see the images for size guides, and don't forget to write the character's name in the order notes during checkout!
2"" mini amiibo figure - £30 (smaller than official amiibo)
3"" regular amiibo figure - £35 (same size as official amiibo)
When I make your character I'll try to recreate it in the likeness of their official amiibo, but if you want a particular pose/expression/shirt then add that info into your checkout notes or drop me a message. I also make customs and OCs, so don't be afraid to get in touch if you want something a little different.
Please note that these amiibo are a popular made-to-order item, and may take a month or more before shipping!        ",39.80,4.9223,"Handmade item

After, time the red plastic of the arms, the head and feet start to warp. That is normal for this type of softer plastic.  If you leave it stored for awhile, his left arm will catch on his leg. Simply bend the plastic outward(GENTLY!) and hold it away from his body for a few seconds, allowing him to work properly again. This will operate best on a flat, hard, smooth surface.

RECENT FEEDBACK
==================
I purchased a journal with floral detail and stamped initials. I was blown away when I received it. It's so beautiful and the quality is spectacular. Once I fill this journal up, I will definitely be purchasing more from this store. ★★★★★
I got this to write in while my boyfriend is in boot camp so we could share our adventures while we are far apart. This was an amazing gift and was perfect for what I wanted it for.★★★★★
Ordered with Fairly short deadline, all arrived on time 😊. Great product, will be cherished for a long time! Great communication throughout the process.★★★★★

14134,Large Wall Stencil Acanthus Trellis Allover Stencil Great Alternatiive to Wall Decals and Wallpaper for Wall Decor,"
            A modern trellis wall stencil pattern. Simple and elegant and perfect for quickly stenciling a wallpaper effect on a feature wall or whole room. Try stenciling with metallic paints for a dramatic effect!
3088L Large Acanthus Trellis Allover Stencil
Actual Design Size: 20.5"" w x 26.5"" h, Reusable 10 mil mylar
Decorating with stencils is fast, fun, and easy! Our durable 10mil mylar stencils are designed to be used repeatedly from an easy-to-clean material.
Stenciled Wall Décor: Use stencils for personalized wall decoration by simply adding in the paint colors of your choice using a stencil brush or stencil rollers. 
Wall stencil patterns include allover damask stencils, motif stencils, and border stencils. You can mix and match stencil designs to create a unique decorating scheme that fits your style and your space.
Stenciling on Fabric: Use stencil fabric paints or simply add Textile Medium (available at the craft store) to any acrylic paint to make it suitable for fabric stenciling. Use stencils on tablecloths, curtains, pillows, placemats, and more.
Stencils on Furniture: Stencils are ideal for adding pattern to almost any hard surface, including furniture. Transform a tabletop, chest of drawers, or cabinet door with paint and stencils. Protect stenciled furniture with multiple coats of water-based varnish to protect your stencil art from normal wear and tear.
For more tips and ideas on using stencils and detailed stencil instruction, see our website at: http://www.royaldesignstudio.com
Our Stencil History: Royal Design Studio was founded in 1994 by renowned stencil artist and innovator Melanie Royals. Since then, we have been creating and developing unique stencils and stencil application techniques for DIYers and professional stencil artisans alike. We are very excited to see another resurgence in interest in stencil art for wall décor, and are very happy to share our stencils and ideas for stenciling with you!

            Aluminium good luck token/charm/pocket token/promise token/motivational coin. Personalised with a message, quote, memorable date or image of your choice.
This aluminium circle makes a beautifully unique love token/pocket token, have a message for your loved one stamped onto it, they can carry this with them always.
The circle is just over 2.5cm wide, is 14g, 1.6mm thick aluminium, meaning it can be stamped on both sides.
Your token will arrive in a 5x7cm organza gift bag, ready to give as a present. 
~Text options ~ 
Unless you request a specific font, I will select the font I feel is most suitable for your piece.
To see a comparison image of all of the font options, please view the photos for this listing: 
https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/182399359/aluminium-hand-stamped-credit-card-size
Typewriter is basic and clear 2mm font, which allows me to stamp the maximum number of characters onto each piece.
Jenna Sue is a 3 & 2.5mm font, very slightly italic, whilst remaining clear and stylish.
Fornax is a 2mm cursive and beautifully elegant font. Fornax is great for use with quotes or poems, to emphasise words within a block of text or to sign a name.
Sculptor is a 3mm uppercase fancy block font, it looks great when used to emphasise certain words in a line/paragraph of text.
Lollipop is a quirky uppercase 4mm font.
Kids print is a 3 & 4 mm font, which mimics the handwriting of a young child. Kids print is perfect for a message to parents/grandparents from children or to sign a name. Due to the larger size of this text it is not suitable for all pieces, and may require a shorter message. 
Large typewriter  is a 6mm upper and lower case font, used for single initials or to begin a word, the large typewriter font looks great combined with the 2mm sized typewriter font.
* PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION *
By purchasing an item from Apple of my eye, you are agreeing that you have read the full item description.
Please view my shop section 'add on items' to find gift boxes and additional options for customising your piece. 
Please let me know exactly what you'd like stamping on to your piece in the ""notes to seller"" section whilst completing you purchase. If you are unsure whether you chosen text will fit onto the shape just send me a message and ill double check for you. If you do not send personalisation with your order, I will contact you once to request personalisation, then unfortunately I will have to cancel the order.
To view my full collection of hand stamped metal, please search Apple of my eye jewellery and gifts on Face book or follow me on instagram lisa.bramley.
Where one aluminium shape is stacked on top of another, over a period of time you will notice very slight wear under the top piece.
Each Individual letter/image is stamped by hand, the letters may not be in perfect alignment. Wherever a letter is stamped, this very slightly changes the appearance of the aluminium on the reverse side of the piece, this in no way takes away from the beauty of the piece and they look great stamped on both sides. 
Please have a look at my pictures which show this clearly. Personally I love the handmade vs mass produced look and feel it makes each piece truly unique.
I work with only the highest quality, food safe, hypoallergenic aluminium.
Aluminium is a lightweight metal, making it perfect for use in jewellery, it is silver in colour all the way through and will not tarnish or change colour when cared for correctly.
Due to the space on each blank, it is not always possible to stamp the text in the exact positioning of your order. I will always stamp the pieces to ensure that they look their best. Due to the volume of orders I receive it is not always possible to contact the buyer before stamping the piece. Should you require a specific layout for your piece, please contact me before placing your order.
I do not have the facility to send a proof of the piece before stamping.
I do not always read the note to seller section before sitting down to stamp your piece, if you need your piece for a certain date, please message me to ensure I can have your piece ready for this date.
To care for all of your items from Apple of my eye, aluminium or sterling silver please follow these few simple steps:
~ Remove your piece before showering or bathing, applying lotions or perfumes.
~ Should your piece need a polish, a silver polishing cloth will do just the trick.
~ Avoid wearing your piece whilst swimming or sleeping.
~ Wear as often as possible, with a smile on your face and be sure to spread the Apple of my eye word!

17666,Santa Earrings - Christmas Earrings - Secret Santa Earrings - Christmas Jewellery - Santa Studs - Holiday Earrings - Secret Santa Gift,"
            Santa earrings, perfect to get you or your loved ones in the Christmas spirit! They are handmade with polymer clay and baked in the oven. All details are carefully done with a tiny needle.
They are great as a secret Santa gift or for anyone who is as excited about Christmas as I am! 
The standard size is about 8 x 8 mm, but it can slightly vary from pair to pair.
Please be aware that all the earrings are individually made, without the use of any moulds and generally the colours used are mixed together, so it's inevitable to have slight variations in colour and form. I can assure you, however, that you won't be disappointed!
If you would like a custom order, do not hesitate to contact me, I am always up for making something new!

            These are such sweet and funky wrist warmers, Gauntlets, Fingerless Gloves……
Various colours available….just choose from the drop down menu of the array of colours……If you are wanting a combo of 2 colours together then choose the 'A combo of 2 colours' from the drop down menu and let me know which colours from the selection you specifically want and for which part of the wrist warmer you want them (i.e., the wrist part and the finger part ;)……
They have a thumb hole to keep them in place when you're wearing them fully over your hands :)  They have a complimenting overlocked stitch, to give them some detail but not too much……They do not get in the way when you are doing things…...
So so warm for your hands and wrists……I find if I am indoors and maybe do not need them fully over my hands I flip the hand part up to create a rather funky gauntlet wrist warmer which also adds colour to any outfit and just keeps you feeling so much more snug and warm…..it really is surprising how much warmer you feel with a pair of fleece wrist warmers on :)
Perfect for all you funky souls out there who are wanting to add that little bit of unique-ness to your outfit and character ;)
Very Faery, Elven, Pixie, Woodland Folk-sters.
