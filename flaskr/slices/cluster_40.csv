946,"Rare Antique Miniature Georgian Lover's Eye Mourning Locket, circa 1820","
            Towards the end of the 18th Century, there was a very brief fashion for one of the most secretive and romantic jewelry gifts...'lover's eye' jewelry. Crafty lovers would present miniature hand painted eye's to each other, in the form of brooches, rings and lockets, so that they could worn with impunity - under the impression that no one else would recognize it and they could keep their love a secret. As you can imagine, these tokens are now immensely scarce and extremely sought after!
Made around 1820, this little pendant tests around 15 carat gold and is set to the front with a border of French Jet and pearls around a tiny locket glass. And inside that glass is hand painted miniature eye. Most likely painted on ivory (the common practice of the time), the eye is looking directly at the beholder. This eye was probably painted earlier than the locket, around 1780/90. We believe it was probably trimmed down from a portrait by a heartbroken husband, and inserted into this locket to remember his dear wife, some time in the 19th Century. It measures only 0.68 inches diameter, and the eye itself is 0.29 inches diameter.
Worn to remember and honor his wife, this sweet little marriage of eye and locket would have been a reminder of their love and his loss - the most romantic and painful emotions all humans have felt throughout the centuries. It leans towards the fashion of mourning jewelry as well as the romantic sentimental era of the 'lover's eyes', and equally special in both ways. Whilst much smaller and not an original 'lover's eye', this token is still so rare and special, and is a must for any antique jewelry fan! 
Condition Notes: As expected for a painting over 200 years old, there is some fading & loss to the eye itself - this can be seen in the photographs. The natural pearls show some abrasions, but nothing detrimental to the piece. The bail is an old replacement, and there is some light denting to the reverse.

Vintage Pinch Pleat Drapes Mid Century Curtains Silky Japanese Screen Print
Screen printed Japanese cherry blossom design; thick, raised print; dark browns, darkish greens, white, and dark ivory on darkened ivory background 
Flirty length and swing; perfect for shabby cottage, mid century, Asian, feng shui, and other elegant decors 
I am unsure of the fabric--it's silky and drapes beautifully, the back is like soft satin, the front more like a sheen, but I cannot say for sure if it is real silk or not; it is definitely luxurious and beautiful.  It is being sold as undetermined fabric, and priced for its vintage, its quality, and its beauty. (If it is real silk, then all the better for you!) 
Each panel measures 49"" long by 31-1/2"" wide 
4"" hems on bottoms of panels are sewn on, and are in a different brocade fabric 
Good vintage condition with evidence of age.  There are a few small snags, ravels, holes, and stain speckles throughout the panels; appear to be faint water stains at the back of pinch pleats; may need a bit of tender loving care prior to hanging.  In spite of these issues, the drapes are beautiful and have been very well cared for by previous owner.  Drapes have been accordion-tied to preserve the pleating, and stored in box for decades.  Have not been cleaned--will leave that to the buyer.  May have musty, dusty odor from years of storage.  Please see pictures for best indication of condition.

2050,Abstract Ceramic Ikebana Vase with Holes - Vintage Vase from Japan,"
            Wonderful, abstract shape to this sculptural Ikebana vase from Japan; circa 1960s-70s. 3 openings for flowers in a long and skinny vase - is there a perfect spot in your home for it?  Love the asymmetry of the holes and those 2 tiny feet.
Vase is in excellent vintage condition with no chips, cracks or flea bites. 12 inches long x 5.5 inches tall x 2 inches deep (at center point). There is remnant of a tag which I left on for provenance - can be easily cleaned off.

            Absolutely beautiful very early hand stitched quilt. This hand stitched work of art is in excellent condition. Most likely from the 1800's, this quilt was probably a 'special occasion' quilt and not used in everyday life. Lightweight this quilt measures 77"" x 82"" approximately. Tightly stitched with attention to detail, this quilt contains 6 rows with 8 patches in each row. Patches measure approximately 6"" square. The gorgeous back is all a blue homespun check. The border is a calico flower brown.  I love this quilt and this beauty is hard to part with. Any quilt lover will appreciate the craftsmanship. I will refund any shipping overages.

4251,Antique Victorian Belle Epoque Fur Muff Gladstone Bag- Engraved Frame- Circa 1880- Steampunk Style,"
            A fabulous antique Victorian Belle Epoque fur muff Gladstone style bag with a beautiful engraved frame and clasp dating from the 1880's.
The design is typical of the Belle Epoch, it features technology and style and must have cost a small fortune. It is this period that inspired the steampunk design that we see today.
The engraved frame is beautifully worked, the engraving is worked to the front, top and back of the frame and to the handle fittings as well. 
The bag opens by sliding the clasp to one side to reveal brown silk lining and a spacious bag. The back of the bag has an intergral muff worked into the design for keeping hands warm on cold Victorian mornings.
The bag is in extremely good condition with just some wear to the lining and to one side of the back of the bag as seen in the photos. It is by far the best example of this style of bag that I have seen yet.
The measurements are;
11.5 x 8  inches/ 15 x 20.5 cm (excluding handle)
The handle measures 13 inches/ 33 cm from end to end        ",188.38,4.9479,"Vintage item from the 1800s

8290,"Lavender Deodorant, Organic Shea Butter Deodorant, Arrowroot Deodorant","
            Almost all natural deodorant (except fragrance)! No aluminum......which is awesome because aluminum (the main ingredient for store bought deodorants) is hazardous for our health! This listing gets you one 2 oz jar of my deodorant. If you have super sensitive pits you can have the option for no baking soda! If you want it to be vegan, I can also omit the beeswax. Just use the option drop boxes to select ""baking soda"" or ""no baking soda"" and for ""vegan"" or ""beeswax"". My deodorants are made to order to ensure freshness. Coconut oil and organic unrefined shea butter helps with moisture and fights bacteria, arrowroot and clay helps absorb wetness. In hot weather your deodorant may become soft, just pop it in the fridge for a few minutes to harden again. 
When using a natural deodorant for the first time, it takes time for your body to adjust to your deodorant. This time period can be days or weeks, which you may sweat more and may need to apply more often to prevent stink. This is NOT an anti-perspirant. If a rash happens to develop, please discontinue use. 
To use, just swipe your finger to get about a dime size amount and rub into your pits. Wait a couple minutes for it to dry, then dress. 
Ingredients: arrowroot powder, coconut oil, organic unrefined shea butter, kaolin clay, baking soda*, beeswax*, fragrance.
* May be omitted upon request        ",7.00,4.7206,"Handmade item

            This if for a full set of resin cast and hand painted Door Knocker replicas from the movie, The Labyrinth.  
They will look great on your front door or even hanging on the wall! The Door knockers are about half scale to the movie version and measure in at about 10-12 inches from top to bottom, not including the knocker ring. (The knocker rings are included in the purchase.)  The knocker comes with a metal hook on the back for easy hanging and will make a great addition to your front door, hall, wall or where ever you need a stately movie guardian! Sadly the door knocker can't talk.

9343,"Made to Order - Mr. Toad Marionette, Wind in the Willows Character","
            ""The clever men at Oxford Know all that there is to be knowed. But they none of them know one half as much as intelligent Mr. Toad!""
- Kenneth Grahame, The Wind in the Willows
NOTE:
This puppet has been sold but I can make one just for you. He will be as close to this one as possible, but since they are all one of a kind there may be some variation. Please allow 2 weeks for the creation and shipping of the puppet.
Mr. Toad is a one-of-a-kind hand crafted marionette.   He is entirely hand-made of polymer clay painted with acrylic paints and varnishes, and dressed in a costume hand-sewn from fabric remnants.  He has a leather driving helmet and goggles.  He hangs from a wooden ""airplane"" style controller on sturdy upholstery thread.  He is jointed with heavy gauge copper wire. Each puppet is a one-of-a-kind creation.
I also have Ratty, Mole and Badger available in separate listings.
Mr. Toad himself is 14"" tall  
The whole puppet including controller is 22""
A simple twist of the controller will make him walk, but h e is really designed to simply be displayed so you can just let him hang around the house.  Although Mr. Toad is based on a children's book, he is not a toy, and is meant to be played with by adults.
NOTE:  I can offer the set of all 4 Wind in the Willows marionettes for a reduced price of 1.000 for the set - please contact me if interested in the set.        ",300.00,5.0,"Handmade item

            CEDAR FLUTE, EAGEL TOP 
NOTE: ——  FLUTE 1 OF 2014 SEE * BELOW
REPRESENTING FLUTE 1 OF 2014 WITH A DEEP TONE AND SOUND OF (G) IT'S A BIGGER FLUTE WITH THICKER SIDEWALLS AND A BIT HEAVIER THEN OTHER FLUTES 
*23""-24"" in length
*6 holes
*Personally signed and numbered
*Genuine leather
*Buffalo carving
*Wind guard
*Clear tone (G)
Hand Polished and clear coated for a Beautiful shine which protects the flute yet reveals the color of the wood
Each flute is built with holes that have been traditionally burned into the flute 
and build from in two halves so that each cut of the wood was from the inside to the outside 
of the flute insuring a higher quality sound, all the Flutes I build have two chambers of air with the top (buffalo)
being the adjustment for sound (like a reed on a modern instrument would work),This part I personally carve into 
the bottom pice and tune not all Flutes sound alike some have deeper tones and other more softer tones, 
Every Flute I build has its own spiritual sound and is Tuned by my NATIVE HEART and played from your Heart.
Cedar Wood was Traditionally used to carve the flutes. Why? Cedar trees hold a special meaning. These trees have a shallow root system. In order to grow strong, their roots must intertwine with other Cedar tree roots for support, and to withstand adverse weathering conditions. This support system was meaningful to Native Americans. Just as the Cedar tree has a network of family support, so did the Indian Tribe. The Cedar tree has always represented the family, and like a Cedar tree, One was never Alone.
WHO ARE WE:
  OUR FAMILY STEPS ARE TRACED BACK TO CHIEF WASHAKIE AND THE BEAR RIVER MASSACRE, GREAT GRANDMOTHER WAS ONE OF THE FEW SURVIVORS OF THAT TERRIBLY ATTACK.  (SEEN IN THE PROFILE PHOTO) SHE WAS A GREAT BASKET BUILDER LIKE MANY SHOSHONE PEOPLE WERE. OUR FAMILY HAS MANY ARTISTIC TALENT, WE ARE KNOWLEDGABLE IN OUR HERITAGE AND KNOW WHO WE ARE, OVER 40 YEARS AGO WE OPENED UP AN INDIAN TRADING POST, WE PURCHASED HAND MADE ITEMS FROM OTHER FAMILY ARTISTS AND SOLD THEM TO HELP PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILY AND OURS.

WE NO LONGER OWN THE TRADING POST BUT STILL TODAY OUR FAMILY CONTINUES TO BUILD AND SELL INDIAN HANDMADE ITEMS.
* NOTE: I ONLY BUILD A FEW FLUTES EACH YEAR NOW, I HAVE BUILT FLUTES FOR MANY YEARS, RECENTLY WE MOVED AND I WAS UNABLE TO FINNISH FLUTES BUILT IN 2014 UNTIL NOW.  
 THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY 2015 FLUTES SINCE THE YEAR IS ALMOST OVER, I WILL PROBABLY ONLY BUILD FOR 2016, IF I BUILD AND 2015 FLUTES IT MIGHT ONLY BE 2 OR 3 WATCH FOR THEM.

11380,1913 Arthur Rackham's Book of Pictures,"
            This is the book that began my husband's Rackham collection. He found it in the 60's. The condition of the binding is poor. The buckram had been glued at the spine causing the book to be stiff. There are cracked pages in the front of the book. However, all the plates are in very fine condition and there is no loss of content. This edition is printed in Great Britain with the subtle colors not found in American printings. It needs rebinding and careful handling. Please consider all of this if you make this purchase. So many of Rackham's earliest books were taken apart in the late 70's and the plates were sold separately. This treasure was saved from that fate!        ",200.00,4.9333,"Vintage item from the 1910s

Verse Reads:
To My Father
This Day You Walk Me Down The Aisle
(Personalized with your Wedding Date or Your Name Here)
Dad, so many feelings come to mind
this day you walk me down the aisle.
As I take your arm and look into your eyes,
I can't help but give a heartfelt smile.
My mind goes back to the tenderness that
you showed when I was small.
You played with me when I was little;
and were there to pick me up when I would fall.
Today Is truly a happy day
but I know you will understand,
there may be a tiny tear
when I reach to take his hand.
I want to thank you for your blessing
as I make this brand new start;
and dad, please know there will forever be
a specal place for you inside my heart!
Love, Your Name
Wedding Date
To My Mom
On My Wedding Day
Today is a joyous day,
it is the day that I become a wife,
it brings me to look back fondly
to all the memories of my life. . .
I remember how we played with all the dolls
and toys that filled my childhood times,
and I cherish all the memories
of games and nursery rhymes.
I thank you for all of the happy times
that we’ve shared throughout the years,
and especially for all the counsel,
and for when you’ve wiped away my tears
On this day I am proud to say that when you look at me,
it is reflection of you and all you’ve done that truly can be seen;
in my heart there will always be for you a special place,
because a mother’s love is something that can never be replaced!
Love, Your Name
Your Wedding Date

            Cochineal is a rare and precious dye made from a scale insect.  It is similar to other ancient natural dyes kermes and lac, and produces very similar colors. It makes lovely bright reds, pinks, and purples.
New to natural dyes?  The cochineal comes with complete instructions on how to use it!
Cochineal is an excellent dye for silk and wool, use 12 - 50% by weight, depending on how bright you want your color to be. 
Like many natural dyes, cochineal produces different tones depending on what fixer (mordant, metal salt) you use!
Alum (crimson red)
Tin (scarlet red)
Copper (violet)
Iron, used after (plum)
Chrome (lavenders) 
Our cochineal is of very high quality, and can be used to make the brightest of colors. It comes from Peru, where the cochineal is cultivated by traditional methods, outside, in the high Andes.
No bugs died to create this dye!  They are collected from the prickly pear cactus after they have already completed their natural life cycle.
This listing is for cochineal in two weights : 
1 oz packet (~ 28 grams)
4 oz packet (~ 113 grams)
If you'd like to purchase in bulk (1 pound or more), please let me know!

✧We hand forge our bands with their special purpose in mind and make them strong so that they will last you for a lifetime. However, kindly note that there are limitations to how strong we can make a thin band of gold. These rings have been carefully enjoyed for the many years we have offered them. Here are a few guidelines and care tips:
1. Ultra thin 1 x .5mm stacking rings are best worn in sets, with other rings that can support them
2. Kindly remove before picking up heavy items that require you to clench your fist where the ring would be pressed against the hard object as they can bend into a D shape
3. Kindly place them safely in a jewellery box during the nighttime
═══Ultra Thin Fashion Band═══
We designed this band with a super thin profile for ladies who would like to add a touch of space between two rings.
✧Ring size selection:
Recommended ring sizes are provided in the selection menu. If you would like a different size, simply select the ""My Size Preference"" option and use the notes section during checkout to leave us your preferred ring size. Kindly take a bit of care when wearing this spacer band in a size larger than recommended.

            A wonderful womans cloche hat handmade from the most beautiful genuine *Harris tweed fabric in a stunning multi autumnal colour herringbone weave .  The hat is fully lined with a cotton fabric and a genuine Harris tweed label is sewn in for authenticity.  A decorative band and three handmade buttons in the same fabric finish the hat beautifully.
Made to order  
size small - will fit up to 21.5""
medium - will fit up to 22.5"" 
large - will fit up to 23.5""
x large - will fit up to 24.5""
If you are unsure of your headsize then follow these simple steps to measure for size. Use a soft tape, start at the forehead working down towards the nape of the neck where a hat would naturally fall and then back up over the ear towards the forehead. Do this three times and take the average measurement, simple!
*Harris Tweed is the only handwoven fabric produced in commercial quantities. The yarn production process uses specially blended yarns produced to secret recipes and then warped up to exclusive designs before being sent to weavers’ homes to be handwoven by highly skilled weavers.
The cloth is then returned to the mill to be finished in a modern finishing plant to a very high standard. The next stage in the process is examination by the independent Harris Tweed Authority, before application of the famous Orb trademark which is ironed onto the fabric as the ultimate seal of approval..
Only then is it genuine, authenticated Harris Tweed. The Orb has served the industry well as a safeguard against imitations and is the oldest British trade mark in continuous use.        ",72.96,4.8889,"Handmade item
