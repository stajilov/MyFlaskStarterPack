            This listing is for one plastic crawling kewpie doll in your choice of cream, pink or rose.  I removed one doll from the original cellophane pack for the photos but the one you receive will never have been removed from the packet.  Measuring 9.5 cm / 4 inches long x 8.5 cm / 3.5 inches high, these adorable little kewpies have molded hair with painted eyes, lashes, eyebrows and lips.  Each doll is marked HONG KONG underneath. There is also a hole underneath which makes them quite pliable.

TUTU DISCLAIMER: You may notice a slight odor coming from the tutu. This is from a stiffening spray that is used on tutus to give it its shape. If desired this can be removed by following the clothing care instructions in the FAQ section. This will in effect give the tutu a softer feel and more flowy look. (In order to maintain it's shape tutu's should be spot cleaned only.)

Breathtakingly gorgeous antique Art Deco mirror with rose-pink tinted glass!
Y'all - I am in love with this mirror. I feel like it should be in the Great Gatsby because it's so quintessentially Art Deco! Two toned Art Deco mirrors can be very rare and hard to come by. Not to mention rose colored glass is such a novelty.
The mirror consists of four beveled glass panels alternating between regular and pink tinted glass. The mirror is held in place to its solid wooden back with 6 metal clips and is hung on the wall with its beautiful original metal chain. The tinted glass is a lovely rose pink that creates warmth and a stunning reflection on the wall! The bevels on the glass go around all sides of each panel and capture the light beautifully. 
Condition: The far left of the top pink panel has a tiny spot where a piece of glass cracked and came loose. It was wedged into place to where it was not falling out, but I glued it down just to make sure. There are a couple of small areas where some age spots or ""silvering"" is occurring under the glass, but they only add to its character in my opinion! The mirror is in overall wonderful condition and the shape and color are so unique!

Whiting & Davis silver metal bracelet with raised repousse floral pattern.  This bracelet is a real impact piece.  Wide clamper bracelet.  Ornate baroque design with small faux pearls inside the blossoms.  #JB111
In the repousse process the bracelet is hammered from the inside to create the pattern. The overlayed pieces are hammered separately and then soldered to the repousse base. This process is what gives this bracelet such a dimensional and impactful design.
Whiting & Davis originally opened as the Wade, Davis & Co in 1876.  In 1880 Charles Whiting joined the company and worked is way up the company from errand boy to artisan to the New York sales rep in ten years.  In 1892, Charles Whiting wove by hand the first Whiting & Davis handbag from gold metal mesh, creating one of the first “It” handbags.   The company also created their second iconic design, the snake bracelet late in the 1890s. By 1896, Charles Whiting had partnered with company cofounder Edward Davis and the name Whiting & Davis was born. Throughout the 20th century Whiting & Davis created highly sought after metal mesh handbags, jewelry and other accessories.  The company is still in existence today using modern jewelry marks to differentiate new items from vintage pieces.

            Adorn your bridal party in rustic vintage worn in flannels! Having a rustic barn wedding? Fall Wedding? Or just want something different than a bedazzled sweater for your bridal party? Get them all worn in vintage flannels!!! 
These flannels are perfect for your ""getting ready"" photo, they button or snap down so won't mess up hair and makeup! 
Matchy Matchy is so out! Be unique with an assortment of vintage flannels.
The flannels in the photo are just an example of a set. The set that you will receive will be completely unique and custom based on your size requirements. All the patterns will vary between small checks, large flannel, plaid etc. but I hand pick each piece to go together and create a cohesive look! 
These will be an oversized they are a boyfriend fit look on women! 
When you order, leave me your custom size run in the notes section of the order. 
WEDDING DATE!! Please leave your wedding date in notes at checkout!! Order NOW for your fall wedding! Don't wait until the last minute as my shipping and processing time may jump to 6 weeks from August - Nov. based on volume. Processing time is 2-3 weeks now! 
All of the pieces I sell are vintage or secondhand. They can date back 30-40 years or be as recent as 15-20 years old. With that said, they each have character! Some pieces may show wear and tear in a cool distressed way, never a “we should turn this into a rag” way. But there will be light distress on your set! Think cool ripped denim. So don’t worry about it.
Color: 
Each set will contain a mixture of colors ranging from Red to blue to green and gray! I try and keep them feminine, but please do not expect these to match your wedding colors! These are meant to be worn before you get all gussied up while you are getting your hair and makeup done for a cute rustic photo opp!
The process: 
Once you order, you leave your sizes in the notes at checkout along with anything else you'd like to mention! I will send you a photo proof of your set about 2 weeks after purchase and once you receive that you can approve or we can work on the order swapping out anything you don't love until you're happy! I will not ship until you approve the proof.
Material:
Most of my vintage flannels are made of wool, acrylic, polyester and cotton and/or a combination of those. If you have any material allergy please include in the notes. 
Sizing: 
All vintage flannels are mens sizing! So please order true to size (if you're a small woman order a small) If you order true to size, the flannel will be oversized or a ""boyfriend"" fit! 
Women – (Ordering true to size will result in an oversized look)

PACKAGING
- I try to do my bit for the environment so please expect to receive your items packed in re-cycled materials, in other words expect some Hungarian news!
***If it's a gift I will of course make more effort in presentation.
All old, vintage, retro, antique and collectible items are unique so they will be packed with care and fragility in mind, they have lived this long why kill them off in the mail!
PHOTOS 
- Should the photographs not give enough detail or information then do ask for additional shots, I try my best to shoot all imperfections or breaks/damage.

3786,50's Schiaparelli pink with gold polka dots négligée.,"
            Marked size 34.
Bust measures up to 34"".
16 3/4"" shoulder to waist.
27"" waist.
38 1/2"" waist to hem.
56"" shoulder to hem.
5' sweep.
This colour is hard to capture.
There is a break in the net on the shoulder, and the right hip, picture in group photos. My mending abilities are not up to my own standards, thus, I'm leaving it as is. There are some loose threads I thought I'd leave, in case they could be used to mend it.
Some gold dots are incomplete. 
This should be able to accommodate large cups, C or DD. This is very loose on my 32"" bust mannequin. Garment measures 16"" across, flat, not stretched.
Plain netting trim feels like cotton. Gold screen printed polka dot fabric is nylon.
Even with two layers of chiffon, this is very sheer.
I am uncertain of the date, given the label I suspect this is late 50's, or 60's. 
I have hand washed this, aside from the splits in the fabric, it is ready to wear.
Please let me know if you have any questions!        ",198.00,4.9111,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            Fibre Art Wall Hanging, Retro Hooked Rug Wall Decor, Boho Wall Decor, Neutral Wall weaving, Mod 1970's Wall Hanging
I'm loving the colors and pattern of this rug hooked hanging!  Earthy neutrals of yellow ocher, black and grey  with longer strands of cream/ivory in a flowing abstract pattern.
Appears to be wool, but I am not sure.  No tags.
It doesn't have anything currently to hang on the wall, save for a narrow hem on the one back end -which could potentially have something strung through it.   The hem is quite narrow though.   
I can see this transformed into a giant floor pillow too...
The size is  30"" X 20""
Have a look at my policies before making a purchase and if you have any questions don't hesitate to email me.

7604,"100% Pure Virgin Neem Oil (organic, undiluted, unrefined)","
            100% Pure Virgin Neem Oil (organic, undiluted, unrefined)
About 75% of Ayurvedic remedies contain some form of neem! Indians call the sacred neem tree ""the village pharmacy"", and have limitless faith in its abilities.
Neem oil is pressed out of the seeds obtained from neem trees. In addition to its use as an organic insecticide spray, it has been used medicinally and in the cosmetics industry. 
Neem oil is used on humans, on animals, and on plants, for a huge range of different problems.
How to use 100% pure cold-pressed Neem Oil:
Recommended ratio for making spray solution: mix 1 teaspoon pure neem oil in a quart of warm water and 1/4 tsp. castile soap. Shake it  well to mix properly. Quantity of neem oil can be increased proportionately for making spray in larger quantities.
Here is some ways to use Neem oil below. Remember: to keep your dilution of Neem oil to about 2 - 5% of any mixture that you apply directly onto your skin.  Some of the recipes below use higher percentages - but keep a lookout for any skin irritation.
Cuts, wounds, minor skin disorders and mosquito and insect repellant
Mix with a carrier oil in a ratio of 1:5 and apply to affected area.
Athlete’s foot
Add 15 ml to warm water and soak the feet in this preparation.
Head lice
Mix 50/50 with a carrier oil and massage into the hair and scalp. Leave on for 1 hour and shampoo. Repeat once weekly for 3 weeks or as long as the problem persists.
Stop mosquitoes breeding
Spray or pour oil on all breeding areas. The oil can be emulsified (to mix with water) by adding Castile or any natural liquid soap.
Plant protection
Add 30 ml to 1 liter of water and add 1 ml of castile or any natural soap. Mix well and spray immediately for plant protection. Do not store the mixture; make fresh formulation for each spray. Spray the mixture on top of all the leaves and on the undersides where insects often hide – you can also spray it around the roots.
Lamp oil to ward off mosquitoes
Add 5 – 10% oil to any lamp oil and burn lamp normally.
Dandruff and itchy scalp
Add a few drops to your regular shampoo.
Ticks and fleas on animals
Add a few drops to your normal pet shampoo (ratio should be 30 ml (1 oz.) to 240 ml (8 oz.) shampoo). Personally we have found that plain castile soap works the best.
Warts
Apply 1 drop of undiluted oil directly on warts once per day. Watch carefully for any possible irritation, and should that occur discontinue use. Continue for 2-3 weeks.
Psoriasis, cold sores, eczema, athletes foot, skin ulcers and other fungal skin conditions
Mix 1 tablespoon (15 ml) with 4 ounces (120 ml) carrier oil such as jojoba or grape seed oil and apply twice a day to affected skin. Should skin irritation occur, discontinue use, or make mixture with less Neem oil.
Pet and livestock spray for ticks, fleas, mange mites and other pests
Mix 1 ounce (30 ml) oil with 1 gallon (3.8 liter) water and add a few drops of Castile Soap (to emulsify the oil). Place mixture into a spray bottle or other type of sprayer, and spray animals once every two weeks. (This mixture can be used on indoor and outdoor plants as well as flowers and vegetables.)
Cleaning the house
Add to carpet shampoos and spray mattresses to kill dust mites.
Hand wash
Add a couple of drops to liquid hand soap for antibacterial properties.
FOR ALL THE ABOVE
As Neem oil has a rather strong smell you might want to add a few drops of essential oil to any mixture to mask the smell. Lavender or lemongrass essential oils work well – but you could add your personal favorite.
 
Store neem oil in a cool dark place, away from sunlight. In case neem oil solidifies due to low temperatures, put the bottle in warm water (below 95 degree F) to liquefy. Putting the bottle in very hot water may reduce the effectiveness of oil.

7702,Shark Toy Soap- Soap with Toys- Guest Soap- Party Favors,"
            Shark Toy Soap- Soap with Toys- Guest Soap- Party Favors 
Shaaaaark!!! Let your little one's imagination run wild with these fun soaps! You can even use them for themed party favors or guest soaps! These glycerin based soaps contain a little shark toy ""swimming"" inside. Each bar is hand poured and weighs approximately 3 - 3.5 oz. each and measures 3 x 2 x 1.  inches. I will choose at random the toys that you get so it will be a surprise! Choose the desired quantity from the drop down. If you would like a scent, message me, otherwise they will ship unscented. Soap will ship wrapped in clear plastic wrap to avoid exposure to moisture.
WARNING: CHOKE HAZARD
Adult supervision is highly recommended as every soap contains a small toy that could find it's way into your little ones mouth. Also note, that the toy is made of plastic and could scratch if used on bare skin. I recommend rubbing the soap on a loofah or washcloth to bathe. If you choose scented soap, while it may smell delicious, it is not edible. 
GLYCERIN DEW
Glycerin moisturizes by drawing water into itself. The theory is that when you wash with glycerin soap, there will be a thin layer of glycerin left behind, which will then draw moisture from the air, onto your skin (thus, moisturizing your skin). When the soap sits out, the glycerin in the soap may draw the moisture out of the air, and onto the soap. If you live in a humid environment, you may find that your soap has water droplets on it or get ‘glycerin dew.’ Try to keep your soap in a cool, dry environment. DO NOT LEAVE IT IN SUNLIGHT. Please also note that if you choose a scent, it may discolor the soap over time. 
Ingredients:
Soap Base- Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Palm Oil, Glycerin (kosher, of vegetable origin), Purified Water, Sodium Hydroxide (saponifying agent), Sorbitol (moisturizer), Sorbitan oleate (emulsifier), Soy bean protein (conditioner)
- Soap Safe Colorant
-Can be scented with skin safe fragrance oils. For Scented, please message me :) Otherwise, soaps will ship unscented.        ",4.00,4.9517,"Handmade item

I've made you a Mixtape- AS SEEN ON THE TODAY SHOW - Australia
Share photos, songs, films and memories, with this perfect gift in a classic retro style. 
Once the highest of all loving gestures, the Mixtape is now, in the 21st century, grossly impractical. And what a loss this is! As a personal, thoughtful gift that proved the giver had put in a huge amount of effort, was it not the perfect present for a loved one?

The USB Mixtape allows you to store up to 4GB/8GB/16GB of an unlimited range of files and media for you to present to your loved one as a thoughtful gift with a novel and fun design. For example, celebrate your best friend’s birthday by giving them a compilation of photos, songs and videos that showcases their life so far. For newlyweds, look back at the music and memories that define your relationship, from the first date all the way to your honeymoon.
And don’t feel you have to stop there. Eternalise the past by scanning in old photos or handwritten love notes, include documents of your favourite recipes or stories, remember those funny text messages with phone screenshots and edits, add links to your in-joke websites or the ones that really meant something to you both… Possibilities are endless!
Each tape label can be personalised with your own message and design. For example; ""DJ Sam's Mixes"", ""I Love you Hazel"" or ""Our Wedding Memories"" etc 
I’ve Made You A Mixtape: Personal and personalised, it’s a very special gift for that very special someone.

10035,"Best Cribbage Board, 3 player Premium  Cribbage Board, 16.5""L  x  6""W  x  2""H, Two Tier, Maple Top/Cherry Bottom, Laser Engraved, Paul Szewc","
            This fun wooden cribbage board can be played with 2 players, 3 players or 4 players (partners).
The board was designed and made from solid hardwoods by Wood Artist Paul Szewc of Guelph. The top is made from solid Hard Sugar Maple and the bottom is solid North American Black Cherry.
Frustrated with the standard cribbage board, Paul took a new direction on the cribbage board. He has drilled the peg holes further apart so you can grip the pegs easier.  As Paul grows older his eyes don’t see as well as they used to, so he has enlarged the numbers for easier reading. The scoreboard has been laser engraved—an upgrade from the screen-printed boards normally seen. The laser engraving will not wear off.
The ""wonky"" design of the board and the custom laser-engraved skunk and double skunk images add his own flare. The wonky design is like his mini wonky jewelry boxes - whimsical.
It is finished with multiple sandings and sprayed with sealer then sanded again and then sealed. This creates that smooth-to-touch finish. This process is the same as what a high quality piece of furniture receives. It is very durable and requires no care.  Simply wipe with a damp cloth if it becomes dirty. It will last for many years to come.
Each unit comes with a product gift tag and scoring pegs. Please see below for scoring peg options. View the first photo which shows wooden pegs and the other photos which show the metal pegs; pick which one you would like. Playing cards are NOT included. 
Scoring Peg Options:
Wooden - Red, Black, Natural
Metal - Gold, Silver, Black
 
The top fits snugly into the base, held in place by rare earth magnets. The bottom compartment is the perfect place to store a deck of cards and scoring pegs. A great way to keep everything together and transports well. 
This 3 player cribbage board is a delight to use and a delight to the eye!
Total dimensions of nestled unit  are 16.5""L  x  6""W  x  2""H.  
Due to variance in wood grain, your item may differ slightly from the one pictured.
NOTE: HOW TO ORDER
To order a board with wooden pegs only pick Wood/no personalize
                               with metal pegs only pick Metal/no personalize
To order a board and personalize it pick the pegs either wood or metal w/personalize (NOTE: Engraving is usually put on the front of the board in between the skunks. If it doesn't fit there we put in on the back of the lid. If you wish it to be elsewhere you need to specify in Note to Shop.) Personalizing a board DOES NOT SLOW shipping response time. We still ship the same day or next.

10720,Harley quinn and joker Valentine boyfriend girlfriend quirky birthday present suicide squad gift,"
            Hi there,
This is a 5x7 framed print. The minifigures are not actual LEGO brand but fit lego :) To buy the real ones would make this item far to expensive to buy :(
The joker can vary between these 2 jokers depending on what is in stock!
The background print has been printed on high quality photographic paper and the frame is made of wood and the cover perspex. 
Pre designed frames such as this only take 1-3 days to dispatch but personalised ones can take up to a week depending on printing times as they are all sent off to be printed on photographic paper. I find this helps the colours stand out more and adds some texture to the paper.
I have a wide variety of superheroes to choose from so please message me for any special requests. I love getting new ones to think of and new superheroes to work with so please fell free to message me and check out my other listings!
Please put all custom request info on the buyers note as during the busy times I receive a high volume of emails and I can't always keep track of every change!
Thanks xo
**Postage to America and other countries is more expensive now as I am now sending it tracked and signed. This way no items can be lost. If you want to reduce the postage and not pay for tracked items then I can reduce them but I can not take responsibility for the item going missing in the post. I can provide you with a receipt that has your address on it as proof of postage but no tracking information. The higher postage means you can track your item all the way.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ATTENTION VERY IMPORTANT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Orders must be placed at least 60 days in advance.  We normally have all of the soaps listed here in stock so there is a good chance we can fill a rush order if you are short on time! Please message us! 
 
We ship wedding gift orders out 30 days prior to the wedding date that way it leaves enough time for you to get ready and also the soaps will be fresh. If you order your soaps way ahead of time we still wait to ship the order.  Etsy shipping does not allow us to customize the shipping times per order at this time. The ship by date time will not be accurate most of the time because of this.  If you would like your soaps sooner than that please let us know! 
~~~At checkout please put the details for your labels in the comments section : ( name , date , etc.)~~~
If you would like something other than the standard message on the back of the label please include that also.        ",95.00,4.9317,"Handmade item

14166,"Vintage Lace Borders - white lace digital borders, ivory lace borders, photography overlay, wedding clipart, printable Instant Download 5017","
            Lace digital borders are made from real vintage lace patterns. These 8 unique designs are organic and imperfect, just like real lace! See closeup photos for details.
There are 8 different designs, and each comes in white, ivory, and a 50% transparent black shadow version. The shadow can be layered with the other colors if you need to make the lace stand out against lighter backgrounds. 
They're each at least 12 inches long, and the ends match up, so the patterns can be repeated to be even longer if needed.
About white digital files: on most home & copy center printers, white in your design will print as clear, not white. A white image printed on colored paper will just display the paper. To appear white, a white image needs to be printed on white paper, and needs to be placed on some kind of background or surrounding color in the digital file. (To print in actual white ink you'd need either a high-end machine or a professional printing press.) Similarly, any light-colored images will not print well on darker paper - the paper will show through the ink. Please keep this in mind when considering the paper you use, and how to create your design.
Please see all my lace digital products: 
http://etsy.me/1wCMPHn
You will need to be able to unzip files and have software that allows you to open transparent PNG files. You will also need to know how to layer files if you wish to use the shadows. These are digital files that you can download as many times as you wish! No physical product will be sent.
They are great for graphic design, wedding invitations, bridal shower invitations, website design, blogs, scrapbooking, paper crafts and more.

            Michael Miller. Bitmap in Black, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Brown - this is NOT a copyrighted, licensed Minecraft fabric
Since this is not a licensed minecraft fabric and is just the pixels that are inherent in the minecraft game, you can easily sew with this fabric and sell with it and you will not be violating any copyrights with the fabric itself. 
Price starts at 4 for a 1/3 yd and goes up to 10.99 for a full yard. We hope to make the fabric cuts available helpful to the seamstresses who shop with us! 
Any cut over one yard is always cut continuous. 
Note: When ordering in excess of two items OR two yards, please send me a convo so that I can set up a custom listing. Otherwise, Etsy will overcharge you on shipping. Etsy does not allow us to enter the weight per size cut of the drop down menu. It only has a place for weight of the full listing which of course is not accurate if you are ordering small pieces or if you are ordering several yards. 
This fabric is 44/45 inches wide. It is 100% cotton woven.

MAKE YOUR DESIGNS SPARKLE.
Add the sparkle of glitter effects to any logo with JSI Glitter heat transfer film. Perfect for dance and cheer wear or anywhere you need some extra shine. Glass like fragments make this the ultimate in glitter transfer films. 90% of JSI's glitter comes from 2 different Korean suppliers.
Keep in mind, glitter often has slight shifts in adhesive and amount of glitter and slight shifts in color from batch to batch. Cutting glitter vinyl is not quite the same as cutting standard materials. Due to the thickness, we always recommend double cutting or cutting with a two pass. Also, if your plotter allows you to change the thickness of the blade, using a 60 degree blade will make the job much easier. As always, you should do a test before sending your whole job, and adjust your pressure/speed from there. If you are unfamiliar on performing a test cut, there is a guide here. We also have a guide here with some other tips on cutting glitter HTV.

15199,Amazing Aragonite Crystal Cluster Medium Size,"
            This is a listing for 1 Aragonite Cluster. The energy of these Aragonite crystals are very uplifting and have a way of making you feel good inside. Some of these beauties will contain clear or white blades of crystals. We will hand select one Aragonite for you :) They measure between 1 1/4 to  1 3/4 ( 31mm to 44mm) inches across. Perfect for the collection, energy healing or the adventurous jewelry maker :)
Crystal Healing Properties (from 101 Power Crystals by Judy Hall)
Aragonite resonates with and helps to open heal and align the Earth Star, Base, Sacral, Soma, Throat, Third Eye, Heart, Soul Star and Stellar Gateway Chakras.
Aragonite is calcium carbonate, formed from stalactites, and is an excellent Earth healer; it also creates the highest spiritual connection for our planet. Working with Aragonite reminds us that the Earth is a living, conscious being with whom we must live in synergistic harmony. The stone links one to the Earth's etheric grid and facilitates the planet's own ascension into expanded dimensions, teaching the interconnectedness of all life.
An excellent soul healer, Aragonite is also a profoundly physical stone. It is alkaline and warming, especially for the extremities. Brown Aragonite stabilizes the base chakra and grounds the soul comfortably in the physical body. 
Aragonite takes one back into childhood to find the source of anger, anxiety or dis-ease. The stone's vibrations also convey one to past lives to heal the etheric imprint of karmic wounding or emotional blockages. If one is a hard taskmaster, this patient stone helps one to be more forgiving and gentle with ones self, replacing unrealistic expectations with achievable goals.

            We offer some of the finest quality, locally sourced American Beeswax available. Our beeswax bars are triple filtered and perfect for candle making, soap making, lotions, and for cosmetic use. All of our beeswax is free of impurities and hand poured into 1 ounce bars.
We source our beeswax from family owed or individually owned apiaries. We support local small business from all over the United States. 
Unlike most suppliers of high quality Beeswax; we provide two types/ colors for purchase. We offer Yellow/ Golden (varies according to supplier) and brown.
Our Brown wax gets its color from Buckwheat pollen. It smells a little sweeter but is not recommended for use in candle making due to the high amount of pollen contained in the wax. Some uses for brown beeswax include woodworking, drill bit lubrication, lotions, cosmetics (will provide a brown natural coloring), zipper lubricant and cleaner, wooden drawer lubricant, thread strengthening, blacksmiths use, polishes, healing balms, etc.        ",4.00,4.9361,"Handmade item

Use the patterned brass sheets to texture your metal clay pieces before firing. The brass won't react with the metal clay.

18734,Men's ALLEN EDMONDS Shoes Hillcrest Bicycle Toe Oxford Style in Cognac Leather Made in USA - Size 12 B - Chestnut Dasco Shoe Trees Avail,"
            Very nice Allen Edmonds shoes Made in USA out of hand selected, excellent quality, all leather components (uppers, soles, insoles, stack heels). Beautifully stitched and finished. Rich saddle brown or cognac color. Size is Men's 12 B. Fit is just slightly narrower than the commonly available Medium or C width. This is nice for wearing thinner dress socks, or if your feet are more streamlined than average.
Have clocked in a fair number of closet hours - worn only about four times as they didn't suit the wardrobe. Walked in from the parking garage and around the office floors a few times. Condition is very good, NS, no odor (except that leather scent), heels are like new, shoes are very clean inside and out. Leather has been well-conditioned.
The Dasco, Made in England, vintage bent wood shoe trees shown are also available and fit/match the shoes well. See other listings.
Shipping cost will vary by location. If you would like a quote, please just tell me where and the code (and whether you want to include the shoe trees) and I will send you the information and adjust the listing if you decide to purchase.        ",95.00,4.9444,"Vintage item

Our classic Bolo Ties are the perfect throwback accessory for all you fashion-forward trendsetters--you know who you are . . . . always on the lookout for that little somethin-somethin' that'll set your style apart from the crowd . . . Our Bolo Ties are unisex in design and can be dressed up or down, worn to your next festival outing, or to your grandmother's wake; the possibilities are endless, and we won't judge.
There's no wrong way to wear your Bolo Tie! Cinch it up tight around your neck or drape it loosely like a necklace--it's up to you. Either way, our Bolos will tie your look together effortlessly with their classic, timeless style.
Bolo Ties aren't just a fashion accessory--they're more like the MacGyver of fashion accessories. When your Bolo Ties are ""off-duty"", you'll find they have a countless number of potential uses other than their starring role as the apple of your outfit's eye (like as a belt, a hat band, a luggage tag, hung as a rear-view mirror accessory . . . should we keep going?)
