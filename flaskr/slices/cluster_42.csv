5625,Antique Chinese Hair Pin Qing Dynasty Late 1800s Kingfisher Jade Flowers Birds Dangles Signed,"
            This elegant antique Chinese hair pin dates to the late 1800s.  It features an ornate design with five dangles.  There are only remnants of the kingfisher feathers that originally adorned this piece.  There are also small jade flowers,  faux pearls and small birds.   The whole piece measures 7.75"" long.  The top measures 2"" across.  The five dangles wiggle when the pin is worn.  There appears to be maker's mark on the back (please see last photo).  I'm not sure what the metal content is on this piece.  There is darkening on the metal and the pearl finish has worn off the glass beads of the faux pearls.  This rare piece is worthy of restoration or wearing as it is.    This will be shipped via USPS Priority within the United States.  
Non-smoking environment.
I ship worldwide.   Please contact me BEFORE checking out if you would like this shipped outside the United States.  
I happily combine shipping to save you money.

CARE!
This is easy to care for. Spot clean with a damp cloth, or wash by hand (you can use a mild soap), rinse again, pat off excess water and air dry. I do not recommend submerging the clip in a water bath, as it is untreated wood and the pores and grain in the wooden clip can slowly open up with excess moisture. As with any natural wood item, if this does happen give it a quick polish with some fine-grit sandpaper to give it new life :-)
This item is handmade and as such may vary slightly in length and bead placement. Colors may appear different on your screen than in person due to individual screen/monitor settings.

            Gorgeous tiara for your little princess!! You will get one clear rhinestone, gold tiara crown measuring approximately 3-3.25 inches. This tiara (made of alloy, gold plating) was designed specifically for One True Wish and is about 1 inch bigger in size to most of the tiaras being sold on Etsy!! 
 
Due to the weight of the tiara, a partially lined alligator clip will be added to each headband to allow the tiara to stand up and stay in place - as shown in the last picture.  You can also pick to have the tiara placed on a clip with no elastic.  
*** PLEASE READ:  For newborn photographs, the tiara can lie on the head or be held standing in place by the elastic. If you want the tiara to stand up and stay in place, please pick ""Elastic Clip"" so the clip will be added for stability. ***
The headbands are sized as follows:
Newborn - 12.5 inches
0-3 months - 14 inches
3-6 months - 15 inches
6-12 Months - 16 inches 
12 months-Teen - 17.5 inches 
Adult - 18 inches 
The tiara will come with a WHITE elastic. If you prefer another color of elastic, please message me ... I have lots of colors so just ask!  The elastic used is 1/8 inch skinny elastic that is hidden and not visible through the tiara.  A larger elastic can be requested, but it will be visible when looking at the tiara....please message me with any questions.  Felt is used to make sure everything is soft against the head.

15739,5 Cardboard Emanelo Cigar Boxes for Crafting Projects B20,"
            This cool set of Emanelo cigar boxes was found at a local auction. We came across an entire unopened box of cigar boxes that still had the manufacture stamp on the outside of the box! We have not been able to ascertain when this actual brand was manufactured, but we believe these to be entirely modern. We think that these would make awesome craft project boxes!
You will receive 5 boxes with this listing. We aren't sure, but we think that these were never used to store cigars. We couldn't detect any tobacco odor in them. It does look like there is a little bit of wear to the corners on some of the boxes.
These boxes measure approx. 8 1/2 inches long by 6 1/2 inches wide. They are about an inch deep.
These boxes would love to be re-purposed as containers for your sewing sundries, vintage buttons, or vintage marbles. These would also be a unique box to ship your handmade items in. 
Shipping is automatically combined on multiple purchases. We have estimated shipping for a 3 pound package to the West Coast from our zip code. Shipping may be less if you live closer. Please contact us for an actual postage quote to your zip code.

16196,"1 foot brass solder wire, 20 gauge, contains 38% silver, also known as soldering wire and brazing wire, good color match for red brass, 1 ft","
            One foot of wire.  The wire you get is coiled and secured with twist ties.
Here is a 38% silver brazing alloy that is a good color match for your brass metal creations.  
I have experimented with this solder wire on both red brass and genuine bronze.  The result is that I have found this particular solder wire to be a very good color match to red brass (yellow brass has not be attempted)  This solder hardens to a  light, bright gold that blends very nicely with the red brass bezel and wires that I carry.  It also stayed golden after filing and sanding.
As for genuine bronze, it makes a makes a solid join but is not an exact color match for the pinkish gold of genuine bronze.  It was not terribly noticeable as a different color, just not a perfect match and a heavy application of this solder on genuine bronze may show a slight color difference.  For a solder wire you might like for genuine bronze, please see the link to a 30% silver solder below which provides a better (more pink) color match.   
Specs:
Country of Origin:  USA
Solidus temp:  1200 F (650 C)
Liquidus temp:  1330 F (721 C)
Thickness:  20ga (approx .80 mm)
Silver:  38%
Copper:  32%
Zinc:  28%
Tin: 2%
Soldering your own metal pieces is fun!  Cut into tiny pieces using your solder cutters inside a plastic bag to keep the pieces from flying around the room.  Use safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying pieces of solder!   Do not cut solder in the presence of children or others without eye protection.  Avoid creating and breathing metal dust and fumes in a non-ventilated space.  Always have a carbon monoxide detector in the room with you!  Have fun and be safe creating what you imagine.
Remember to clean your metal, flux your joins and make sure your joins have a tight fit before soldering.  Solder is never meant to fill gaps in joins.  Always use the least amount of solder necessary to create the join!  I like to use a sticky flux and a tiny paintbrush to place my teeny pieces of solder right where they need to be.

***If you don't see your size and you would like to order a custom pair, made just for your specifications, shoot us a conversation.***
CARE: Before inserting the jewelry in your ears, wash gently with soap and water. Always make sure your hands are clean before handling your piercings. To reduce opportunities for breakage, it is suggested to take the jewelry out before showering, sleeping, and roughhousing :) Be very careful when styling hair, and use a snag free pillow if you need to keep the jewelry in at night.

All our sandals are handmade in Tuscany through manual procedure and with the utmost attention to quality, in order to meet our customers' needs.

The vegetable tanned leather absorbs the traces of our past in getting old without getting ruined.

            Extra long Gladiator black sandals made from swim wear swim suit Lycra 
Black over the knee high spider sandals. These sandals are a hand made new style of a foot wear. The sandal is created from  top quality swim wear Lycra fabric that fit the leg like a second skin.  the sandals decorated with hand made cuts & knots that give this unique gladiator look. The sole is made from plastic and rubber , making it very light on the feet.
SPIDER SANDALS  comes in six sizes : 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41.
Before buying the sandals I recommend to measure your feet from toe to heal & to check your measurement for the sizing.
Spider sandals are not made to be washed , but if they get extremely dirty it is possible to dip them in a bucket with water, gently clean them & to dry  flat in the shade.
measurement list:
euro size ............ us size............... measurement of your feet in cm.
 36...................... 5-5.5 .................... 23.5 cm
 37...................... 6-6.5 ................... 24 cm
 38...................... 7-7.5 ................... 24.5 cm
 39...................... 8-8.5 ................... 25 cm
 40...................... 9-9.5 ................... 25.5 cm
 41...................... 10 ................... 26 cm
If you are not sure about the size you need to order, i recommend to go for the bigger size. it is always more comfortable to walk with a sandal that is 0.5 cm bigger then smaller.
when you buy the sandal pleas give me a note of the size you need.
thank you for joining us in our GOA MAGIC life style.        ",59.00,4.9104,"Handmade item

Welcome to my store where you will find simple, comfortable and absolutely stylish Greek Summer Sandals and colourful handbags all made of real leather.We offer plain leather summer flats but also beautifully decorated boho sandals. In our store you can find tie up gladiators and amazing quality bags made in classic natural colours or you can opt for our best seller strappy sandals in rose gold, silver or beige colour.
All our products are designed by me and handmade by skilled craftsmen using traditional techniques used for centuries. All items are made to order with the exception of some best sellers which we have produced in advance. All sandals are made using real leather therefore there will be variations between styles. Moreover, all sandals made of natural tan leather will age beautifully with time. They all tend to darken as you wear them or when exposed to the sun which makes them even better after every wear.
