            This listing is for an antique 9ct yellow gold ring set with a rose cut diamond. 
This is an antique handmade diamond ring.  It is set with a central rose cut diamond of approximately 0.15cts and is double bezel set.   It has a fine 9ct yellow gold band, which is 2.30 - 2.40mm wide.
The total weight of the ring is 1.90 grams.
The ring is US size 10 1/4, UK and AUS size U.
The ring is in good vintage condition.
This is such an unusual ring - it has a very rustic/natural feel to it.  There are no hallmarks to confirm its age or maker but based on the diamond cut, wear and style, I believe the ring it dates from the 1800s or early 1900s.  
The ring has been examined by an independent jeweller and a valuation is available.

This amazing ring features a sparkling white diamond to the centre, set in a fancy silver filigree tablet which has been overlaid onto cut black onyx. The band is made half in silver and half in 14ct yellow gold. Gorgeous design, wonderfully elegant!
Condition = Very Good. There appears to have been a repair to the onyx on the corner at some point, and a line is visible on very close scrutiny; please see photo number 5. There is also a small nick to the corner, but again this is only noticeable when looked at very closely.

1431,10.25 Inch Wooden Solitaire Board Game With 32 Marbles ~ Made From Walnut Burr Wood And Stone Marbles,"
            Wooden solitaire board measuring 10¼ inches in diameter, thought to be made from walnut. There are 33 holes in the board to house the marbles and a trough around the edge for the marbles to sit when not in use.
There are 32 stone marbles, although It is usual for the marbles to be the same size these are of varying sizes and colours, as can be seen in the photographs.
Condition:
There is a split on the edge of the board that has been filled in (see last photograph).  It appears that it was most probably a natural split that was filled when it was made rather than later damage. 
All the marbles are in good condition with the exception of the black one which has a chip out of it 
The board and the marbles have a handmade appearance, particularly the way the holes have been bored in the wood.

            Victorian 9ct Yellow Gold Onyx Mourning Brooch (with original hair)
Front loading glass panel
Pin and 'C' catch
Unmarked but tested as 9ct gold
Length = 2.4cm
Gross weight = 5.2 grams
Victorian women used to wear mourning jewellery when mourning the loss of a loved one or family member. The use of woven hair was commonplace, although exquisite pieces such as this one would only have been worn by the upper classes, as they were the only ones who could have afforded such things.
This beautiful example has been made in 9ct gold and has been set with 12 black onyx stones. The original woven hair remains.
Condition = Excellent. The original hair and glass panel are in tact and unmarked; there are no chips to the Onyx stones.
~Information about all of my items for sale~
All of my pieces are second-hand (or pre-loved!) but every care has been taken to ensure they are working/safe/secure. As always with vintage items there is generally some sign of wear but I do my best to show this in my photos. If you're unsure about anything then please get in touch - I will be happy to help!

3867,"Framed Rose Print, Red Rose Print, Oval framed rose","
            Cute but not perfect.
I’m sure this was beautiful in its day but now it has some black or brown specs inside the glass, at the bottom (see close up picture).    If you hang it high and don’t stand directly in front of it, it’s not too bad.  The frame has some nicks and the back in is very good condition.  I believe this is from the 50’s, or maybe even earlier.  
There are very light words printed at the bottom:  “Rosa centifolia a Dutch hundred leaved Rose. Published by Mary Lawrance No. 83 Queen Ann St East, Dec. 1796”
Size:  9-3/4” tall x 8-1/4” wide oval.  Wooden (?) frame with glass and hanging hook.

5273,"Original Pen and Ink Drawing, Kelpie Cattle Dog, Signed Drawing,","
            This is an original pen and ink drawing on quality art paper of a Kelpie cattle dog and  signed with intials L.M which stands for L. Mackie. It is titled 'Casterton - Kelpie Country' which is a country town in Victoria Australia near the South Australian border.  It was originally in a very ordinary small pine frame which did it no justice so I have relocated it into this larger plain black frame.  I have kept the original dark oval mount and placed it into the white oblong mount which came with the frame, all in all it looks 100% better and with the pullout stand can sit on a shelf or hang from a hook.

8963,24MM Tuxedo - Extra Dense Synthetic Shaving Brush Knot- Black/White - APShaveCo.,"
            I introduce to you ""The Tuxedo"" - the first EVER black and white shaving knot. 
The knot is named not only after the black/white appearance, but because I believe it gives a truly luxurious experience to your shaving routine. 
The performance of this knot has the ease of lathering of the common ""plisson"" style synthetic with some unique differences. With the testing being done, myself and a few others believe this knot has a similar feel to the ""game changer"" with similar tips to that of the ""uber soft"". It seems to be almost a hybrid between the two.

16481,"Craft Ginger Beer Kit - ""create your own homemade Ginger Beer"" soft drink - Refreshment","
            = A Perfect Gift for ginger beer lovers & budding brewers alike =
Each kit contains enough culture, sugar and ginger (with instructions) to make your own traditional ginger beer ""plant."" The plant is so called because it will provide you with an ongoing supply of 9 pints of ginger beer a week, a wonderful flavoursome soft drink alternative to beer in the evening. The full recipe and instructions included is a tried and tested traditional method to make a classic British ginger beer with ground ginger.
How does it work?
Simply feed your “plant” with ground ginger and granulated sugar every day for one week. At the end of the week the concentrated liquid from the plant is strained off and is made up with sugar, water and lemon juice to make the finished ginger beer, the process is made easy and no special equipment is needed. Once you have made your ginger beer you have the option to start the plant all over again, why not spread the love and give half to a friend to make their own? The instructions include details of how to start a new plant all over again whenever you feel like it.
What is the ginger beer like?
Ginger beer is a fermented drink made using yeast, the fermentation adds characteristic flavour to the ginger beer and the final product is less than 0.5% alcohol so please be assured that our ginger beer is a flavoursome soft drink. If you are diabetic you can still enjoy the ginger beer by making your final drink with “Splenda” in place of sugar.
Quality Garantee
Our recipe has been tried and tested over generations. In making our kits we are conscious to use only fair-trade sugar and high quality ground ginger. All ingredients are dried and have an excellent shelf life.
Delivery
We endeavor for all kits to be delivered within 1 week of purchase within the UK.
Airmail delivery to the USA takes 5-7 working days and Europe takes 3-5 working days on top of packing and shipping arrangements.
For Christmas USA orders -  Please order before 10th December to ensure we can catch the last posting day for Christmas delivery
