2170,Vintage Rustic Large Rusted Metal Wire Storage Basket,"
            Industrial items are becoming more and more popular in homes and businesses alike. Whether you're storing fruit or veg, this big brute is sure to add some rustic charm to any countertop.
The original plastic coating is heavily chipped and cracked all over and will most likely flake off with use. This coating can however be removed with a little effort but we decided to keep it on so you can make that call.
Each basket is sold separately and has it's own individual wear and tear with some bending to the metal in places. One of the baskets has also had some silver paint applied to a side wall at some point. It's also worth noting for those wishing to purchase more than one basket, they do not stack very well and are a little wobbly. We therefore wouldn't recommend stacking them with many heavy objects contained within. 
Measuring approximately 65cm wide, 42cm deep and 27cm tall each compartment can be moved however you see fit. Stylish and utilitarian, these baskets make unique storage solutions not available anywhere else!

            FINAL INVENTORY!!!  These were purchased under the suspicion that they were Vaseline glass. These are smooth flat glass on both sides with rounded smooth edges, measuring 5x5mm.  They do not naturally glow in the dark but will glow under a UV/black light as pictured.  In regular light they are more of a lemony opal color.  You are purchasing 1 strand with 50 beads per strand.
***I am unsure of the age of these and have placed them in the 1970s category but they can be older.  If you have any concerns regarding uranium glass, please Google it.  :)

            Love this wonderful stylized brass Snake! They are old vintage stock with slightly differing Patina's. From Paris France.*NOTE: I have the smaller size listed also.
** Many of the French pieces I offer for sale were purchased directly from France many years ago. They came from the left over inventory of a closed jewelry shop in Paris. Others were purchased recently from the same French Parisian manufacturer who supplied the jewelry shop. They have been in business since 1890. 
         Most of their vintage stampings that I offer here are available in quite limited quantities. New models from their old tooling machines are available in unlimited quantities. *Please contact me if you are interested in purchasing a quantity of 300 pieces or more of one specific model at a reduced cost. (thats their minimum)
~~ Shipping fee applies to 1st item only. FREE SHIPPING for more than one item purchased in one order.
*Sorry.. International shipping is so high but that is what the post office charges for anything that is not a flat paper envelope

2779,Hmong Hand Woven Indigo Hemp Fabric Vintage Soft Cool Hill Tribe Natural Organic,"
            Length - By the yard
Width -  11"" / 27cm
Weight - approx 2.30 oz / 75g per yard
BY THE YARD PRICE 7.50, please contact us for a custom order. Discount available for larger orders.
Genuine Hmong hand woven hemp. Light indigo colour. Soft, fine woven vintage re-claimed hemp.
The hemp is grown by the Hmong tribeswomen, dried, and the hemp fiber stripped from the stem and pounded, boiled, spun and coated with wax before it can be strung on an old wooden loom and woven into the finished product. All year around the tribeswomen can be seen with hemp fibers wound around their hands, using what spare time they have to connect the separate fibers to make one use-able thread.
The Indigo dye is obtained from a plant also grown by the tribe on the edge of their steep rice terraced mountainsides. The fresh cut hemp and the dye can bee seen in the last set of images.
We buy this fabric directly from a number of elderly Hmong women, in a small village, in Northern Vietnam. Vintage used hemp but recently dyed this light indigo colour.
We ship with the very efficient Vietnam Post Office, all orders are trackable, all shipping costs are exactly what VNpost charge us, no profit made on shipping, all shipping overcharges refunded.        ",7.50,4.8,"Vintage item

You will receive a packaged stack of 100 pages gently separated from The Methodist Hymnal dated 1966.  The pages are in excellent condition with a slight beige patina and ready for your craft projects. They are not so old that they crack or break when you fold them. Individual packages vary in songs so you will not always receive the exact music in each lot.
Each page is  6"" X 8.5"" 
100 Pages ~ Hymns are on both sides of each sheet but I count individual pages so you will receive 100.
♥ The listing is for music sheets only. For inspiration the last three photos are craft suggestions only and not made by me however featured in a monthly craft magazine, All Things Paper.

Intuitively chosen
White Spirit Quartz
Chakra: Crown, cleanses all
Spirit Quartz is an exceedingly spiritual stone that embodies all the energetic properties of Quartz. This uplifting stone radiates high vibration energy out in all directions whilst the core crystal tightly focuses healing that reaches multidimensions and reprograms cellular memory. Carrying the gifts of the spirit and enhancing metaphysical abilities, Spirit Quartz assists at death guiding the soul through different dimensions of the afterlife to the highest possible vibration and into the hands of those who are waiting to welcome it home. It provides comfort to those who are left behind, and is excellent for obtaining an overview of any situation. Spirit Quartz can take you to meet the spirits of your ancestors and those of the planet, and can be programmed for ancestral healing. Encouraging insightful dreams, it is helpful in dream and metaphysical work, especially for reframing the past. Carrying the vibration of universal love, this crystal is extremely beneficial in past life healing as it rejigs the etheric blueprint for the present life. Pinpointing significant karmic connections and the gift or karmic justice in traumatic situations, it promotes self-forgiveness. A stone of non-duality that perfectly balances and blends
male and female, yin and yang, Spirit Quartz facilitates the transition between different types brain waves, facilitating combination states, and stimulating heightened awareness and psychic perception.
Group orientated, Spirit Quartz is particularly useful for those who give
service, especially as part of an organisation, as it synthesizes group efforts and can be programmed to bring about productive harmony within members. Facilitating spiritual or healing groups, it provides insights into problems experienced within a community or a family, and can be programmed to alleviate these.
Spirit Quartz cleanses other stones and enhances their energy in a healing
layout. It stabilises earth energies.
I believe that everyone responds differently to crystals and you should go by your own experiences.  What works for me may not have the same effect for you. I suggest trying different crystals and go with your instinct. I believer that crystals choose you.  :)

5143,"City of Refuge, Hawaii Stamp – 11 Cent Air Mail Stamp– National Park Centennial Issue - Block of 4 Unused  Stamps- Vintage US Postage Stamps","
            These 11¢ City of Refuge airmail stamps are part of the National Park Centennial Issue of 1972.  They were issued on May 3, 1972.  This listing is for a block of 4 unused stamps.  
The stamp features a statue of Ki’i with the City of Refuge in the background.  All text is in black – “Natinal Parks Centennial” is along the left margin.  “City of Refuge – Hawaii” is underneath the picture;  “U.S. 11c Air Mail” is in the upper left corner.
Ki’i is an ancient Hawaiian god.  The City of Refuge served as a sanctuary for early Hawaiians that sought purification from temple priests after breaking a kapu (ancient law).  It also served as a place to escape from enemies.  The City of Refuge became a National Park in 1955 – its name was changed on 11/10/19 and again in 2000.  It is now known as Puuhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park.
Each stamp measures 1 3/4” x 1” (4.5 cm x 2.5 cm). The full block measures 3 1/4” x 2” tall (8.3 cm x 5.1 cm).
These stamps are “mint” – meaning they have never been used. They have the original glue.
My grand-aunt collected these. She was not a “true” stamp collector & basically stored them in manila envelopes. Whenever the USPS came out with a new stamp – especially a commemorative one – she purchased at least one sheet & put them away in her envelopes.  More stamps from her collection can be found here: 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/4GetMeNotTreasures/search?search_query=postagestamps
 or by browsing through the Stamps & Ephemera section of the shop here:

  Holiday and Christmas stamps can be found by browsing through the Holiday Home section here: 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/4GetMeNotTreasures?section_id=10146857
 
These stamps are great for collectors both young and old alike. Additionally, they’d be great for paper crafting & jewelry making or anywhere else your creativity wants to take you. They are also a great gift for someone born on the day the stamps were issued. Frame them and give them as a nice and thoughtful gift – or keep them for yourself.

            Protect your dog from the harsh chemicals in sidewalk melt, they won't lick their paws and get sick. Protects from the freezing ground that hurts their paws and causes them to crack.
Prevents from the snow buildup between their toes.
Boots are especially good for very cold temps, are snow worthy, are not waterproofed, but they do dry quickly for their next trip outside.
Made of Fleece with Leather pads, can be washed in washer and laid on surface to dry
Does my dog like to wear them?? No, but after they are on she will walk forever and not get cold.
Otherwise on the frigid days she can't be on the snow only a minute and she lifts her feet in discomfort.
I have had customers buy them to protect their hardwood floors

6258,"GREYHOUND Dog Booties, Dog Shoes, Dog Boots","
            Protect your dog's paws with a set of K9 Apparel Booties. Outdoors, our Booties protect paws from road salt, snow, ice, and harsh lawn chemicals. Indoors, our booties provide stability for your dog when standing on wood or tile surfaces—also protecting wood floors from scratches. Warmth and comfort are built in the design of our slipper-style dog booties. Featuring a protective non-slip embossed Mega Grip bottom that is completely lined with soft, warm Polartec® polar fleece, our booties are uniquely designed with an extra-long upper portion and two sturdy bands of velcro to help hold the booties in place on your Greyhound. Available as a set of four black booties.
 - Polartec polar fleece is soft, comfortable, and warm. This quick-drying fabric is colorfast, does not pill, and is machine washable. Polartec® 200 Classic double velour fabric. Made in the USA.
 - Embossed Mega Grip is a durable rubberized fabric that works well on ice and in snow but wears out on concrete, asphalt, and abrasive surfaces.
Choose the bootie size according to your dog's weight.
Tip: Before you order dog booties, see if your dog is likely to accept them. 
Get two pairs of baby socks or kid's socks that fit your dog's paws. Put two of the socks on either the front or back paws and have your dog stand on a non-slippery surface. If your dog is okay wearing two socks, put socks on the remaining paws and allow some time for your dog to get used to the socks. If your dog will move around wearing all four socks, this is a good indication your dog will accept wearing booties. However, if your dog does not accept wearing socks, it is unlikely your dog will accept wearing booties and we suggest not purchasing booties for your dog.
Note: BOOTIES ARE NON RETURNABLE, NON REFUNDABLE AND NON EXCHANGEABLE. 
*Booties currently only available in black.

            My inspiration for cotton candy skies came one day while enjoying the beach here in Delaware, where the entire night sunset opened open and truly looked like cotton candy floating overhead. It was a beauty and looked delicious and to date the best sunset of my life.
 A delicious gentle sweet cotton candy. It behaves beautifully in the tub and turns a gorgeous purple right before your eyes. Check out a photo from the tub up above. It's a real show stopper.
All our bath bombs offer loads of fizz but also bubbles. We add shea butter to leave your skin with a gentle silky smooth.

            A Charming & Unique Handmade Baby Gift
Rudkin is a handsome, handmade needle felted bunny rabbit with a ginormous tail - and he is the hero of my self-penned rhyming child's storybook. You will receive Rudkin & the storybook nestled snugly in a small kraft box.
If you're new to the concept of needle felting, it is the art of creating felted objects out of unspun wool and fiber using a repeated jabbing action with barbed felting needles. The creations can be 3-dimensional or flat; fun or functional.
This rhyming story is designed to be read out to your little ones, who can see the story come to life as you act out the adventure with your little needle felt bunny.
The story is beautifully printed on 170gsm natural kraft card. The story is 18 pages in total and each page is approximately 3"" x 3"". It is bound together by small metal bindings. Rudkin has the initial 'R' hand sewn onto his badge. He is approx. 3"" tall.
## Personalisation ##
1) I can print a personal message (up to 10 words) on the front cover... 
A birthday story for Emily 
A story to read aloud to Simon
2) I can also hand sew the initial of the child's first name on to the badge of your needle felt bunny (instead of the R) as an added personal touch.
Please message me the details with your order so we can ensure everything is correct.
## Shipping ##
Your item will travel to you Royal Mail 1st Class Signed For (UK) and Royal Mail International Tracked / Tracked & Signed (if your country provides this service) everywhere else. This service allows you to track your item along the way. 
Please note: Rudkin is needle-felted by hand using natural wool and some synthetic fibres. He is a miniature and is intended to be a collectors item as opposed to a toy. He is not mass-produced and has not been safety tested as a toy. Unsupervised play with Rudkin is not recommended.
The book is not safety tested and is not a toy. It is designed to be read aloud by a responsible adult and NOT designed to be left alone with children. This is due to small parts and bindings which hold the book together and could be swallowed if dismantled or detached.

8823,Set of 2 pieces Copper Hair Pins Hair Stick Hair Pin Hair Fork Copper Wire Wrap Hair Accessories for Women Burgundy cherry hair clip stick,"
            Dense studs with garnet. Forged. Copper of 99.9 %. Artificially aged — patina. Copper-bronze shade Polished. They are smooth. Not dirty, do not tear your hair, don't scratch your head (I write for those who have no idea about such jewelry) these studs perfectly hold even a solid mass of hair. About the healing properties of copper has been known since ancient times. Metal peace, harmony and art, equalizer and corrector. In ancient times, most works of art were made of copper or its alloys. And it is also no accident. Copper has healing and magical properties. It is able to identify and clarify our feelings. Copper is capable of making sense permanent and durable. It can convert unconsciously the elusive desire in a quite lucid affection and sympathy. And also, by analogy, to transform the unconscious rejection in quite lucid dislikes. At home copper: fine relationship, smooths conflicts.

Every batch of soap has 24 odd ends they usually party together in some corner or the studio feeling somewhat less valuable than the perfectly cut bars displayed neatly on shelves... these orphaned rugged rustic soap ends just want to be adopted to a loving home where they can be useful and appreciated. 
Listing is for 1 box filled with 8-10 soap ends (however many will fit based on their thickness) a mix of scents that we choose based on availability.

9192,"12 Little Spinning Tops, Unfinished Hardwood","
            Here is a very basic, simple top that will provide hours of fun for both children and adults!  These are unfinished hardwood so the fun starts with maybe some touch up sanding and the painting.  Solid color or swirls of color?  Polka dot or stripes?  What will it look like when it is spun??  And, if you are a really good spinner, what will it look like balanced on the end of your finger?  Ron used to spin one of these tops on the end of his finger at craft shows.  Always a show stopper!  The only trouble was, when other people tried that in the booth, we would have tops zinging in all directions!!  It does take a little practice.
The tops consist of a 1-1/2 inch in diameter by 1/2 inch thick disc and a 1-1/2 inch long by 1/4  hardwood dowel sharpened at one end.  Because of shipping/handling costs involved, we will only sell these in lots of 12 or more.  If you only want one or two (or anything less than twelve), you can add them to other items you are ordering at  .75 each, but we will not ship less than twelve by themselves.  Just convo us for a custom order of all the items you want with adjusted shipping on your combined order.
These tops could be a choking hazard for young children or pets that like to put things in their mouths.  The tops are not recommended for children under five for that reason and because of the sharp point on the end.  KNOW YOUR CHILD AND BUY ACCORDINGLY!
The tops will ship First Class Parcel in the USA and First Class International outside the USA.  If your country is not on our list, please contact us for shipping information.
*******************************************************
*******************************************************
PLEASE READ:  IMPORTANT SHIPPING INFORMATION!!
SHIPPING USA:  First Class Parcel pricing is by the ounce (up to 13 ounces)and is the SAME (by ounces) anywhere in the USA.  Priority Mail and Parcel Select rates change depending on weight, size, and distance.  Our pricing is based on rates to the West Coast since a majority of our sales are in that rate bracket.  If you live closer to Michigan, please ask for adjusted shipping rates BEFORE you send a purchase order and we will set up a Reserved Listing for you.  Just “convo” or e-mail us with your ZIP CODE and a list of the items you wish to purchase.  We will set up the Reserved Listing for you with the revised shipping and you can order as usual.  (Keep in mind that I cannot see what is in your shopping cart!)
Of course, you can always just order and pay and we will refund any shipping overpayment if it is above 2.00!  Our shipping refunds go through PayPal and are done at the same time as we print up your shipping label.  No long waits for a refund!
MULTIPLE ITEMS:   I’m afraid I got tired of trying to guess at shipping for multiple items when we have such a variety of items and weights.  It just doesn't work for us.  We do offer combined shipping; we just can't show it on the listing!  Please e-mail or convo me for shipping on multiple items BEFORE YOU CHECK OUT and we will be glad to give you a price on shipping to your door!  Shipping is usually much less for one combined shipping price than for the shipping prices on each item added together! Although, sometimes it is cheaper to ship in two First Class Parcels than in one Priority package when shipping to the West Coast!  Just another shipping nightmare to deal with.  See above paragraphs for more info.
USA SHIPPING TIMES:  First Class Parcel delivers in 2 to 5 business days. Priority Mail delivers in 2 to 3 business days.  Parcel Select delivers in 5 to 9 business days.  All have tracking included.  We do not ship Express Mail!  Insurance is additional.  If you would like insurance, please ask to have it added to your order BEFORE purchasing.
INTERNATIONAL ORDERS:  First Class International is by the ounce up to 4 pounds.  Priority International is by the pound and is used for anything over 4 pounds.  Rates are high, but we do the best we can.  We do combined shipping on multiple orders the same as we do in the USA.  Refunds are also treated the same.  Any duties, fees, taxes that might occur when your package passes through customs is your responsibility.  Every country handles small parcels a little differently. 
Currently, First Class takes from 6 to 15 business days (or more) with tracking available in a few countries.  Priority takes 6 to 10 business days with tracking and some insurance included.

            Meet Rudkin! He is an adorable handmade needle felted bunny rabbit with a ginormous tail - and he is the hero of my self-penned rhyming child's storybook.
You will receive both Rudkin and the storybook nestled snugly in a small kraft box; it is a very cute gift for a toddler or new born baby and an ideal baby shower gift.
The rhyming story is designed to be read out to your little ones, who can see the story come to life as you act out the adventure with your little needle felt bunny.
The story is beautifully printed on 170gsm natural kraft card. The story is 18 pages in total and each page is approximately 3"" x 3"". It is bound together by small metal bindings. 
Rudkin has the initial 'R' hand sewn onto his badge. He is approx. 3"" tall.
Most of the fleece I use to needle felt Rudkin is hand sheared from my own little flock of 5 ewes. They were all orphan lambs when I got them and I bottle fed each one giving them a wonderful start in life. If you're new to the concept of needle felting, it is the art of creating felted objects out of unspun wool and fiber using a repeated jabbing action with barbed felting needles. The creations can be 3-dimensional or flat; fun or functional.
## PERSONALIZATION ##
1) I can print a personal message (up to 10 words) on the front cover... 
A birthday story for Emily 
A story to read aloud to Simon
2) I can also hand sew the initial of the child's first name on to the badge of your needle felt bunny (instead of the R) as an added personal touch.
Please message me the details with your order so we can ensure everything is correct.
## Shipping ##
Your item will travel to you Royal Mail 1st Class Signed For (UK) and Royal Mail International Tracked / Tracked & Signed (if your country provides this service) everywhere else. This service allows you to track your item along the way. 
## Please Note ##
Rudkin is needle-felted by hand using natural wool and some synthetic fibres. He is a miniature and is intended to be a collectors item as opposed to a toy. He is not mass-produced and has not been safety tested as a toy. Unsupervised play with Rudkin is not recommended.
The book is not safety tested and is not a toy. It is designed to be read aloud by a responsible adult and NOT designed to be left alone with children. This is due to small parts and bindings which hold the book together and could be swallowed if dismantled or detached.

375 answers taken word-for-word from the works of William Shakespeare.
Totally hilarious.
“THE SMUTTY SHAKESPEARE GAME YOU NEED FOR YOUR NEXT SMARTY-PANTS PARTY.”
—Washington Post
To be profane, or not to be? BARDS DISPENSE PROFANITY is 100 mock-serious questions for our time and 375 answers copied word-for-word from the works of William Shakespeare. You be the judge of which answers are best. Answers come from 24 of Shakespeare's 38 plays, and each answer card cites the play, act, and scene (in case your dad doubts that Shakespeare really has Hamlet allude to “the incestuous pleasure of his bed”). 
FREE U.S. SHIPPING!
(International shipping also available.)
— Unobtrustive glosses on about 10% of the cards define archaic words with non-intuitive meanings.
— Works best with 4 or more players.
— Not for kids.
— “A deep knowledge of Shakespeare’s plays is not an essential requirement for winning this game,” raves the Washington Post’s book critic.  (Seriously.)
— From the makers of DICK: A Card Game Based on the Novel by Herman Melville, featured in New York Magazine and the Washington Post.

10039,Shut the Box game,"
            This is our take on the classic pub game called 'Shut the Box'. The box is crafted from hickory, with walnut sliders, and is designed to be portable.
To play, the dice are rolled and any combination of number(s) which add up to the total on the dice, may be covered. A player continues rolling the dice until no additional numbers can be covered. At which point the game is over, and the uncovered numbers are added up for the final score. The goal is to get the lowest score possible. 
There is also a two player version where one player attempts to cover numbers and the other player tries to uncover numbers. The winner is the first one to cover / uncover all numbers.
It is fun for all ages and helps teach addition and subtraction (just don't tell the kids that it is math.) It's a nice alternative to electronic games, and it looks more attractive than a game console too.
2 dice and full instructions are included. The overall dimensions of the box are 11-1/2” x 5-1/4” x 1-3/4”
Finish: Our standard finish of Danish Oil (to bring out the wood's color & grain), followed by several brushed-on coats of semi-gloss polyurethane (to protect the wood's surface).        ",60.00,4.9444,"Handmade item

            ABC Alphabet Animal Book
Welcome to my A to Z of Amusing Animals.' This adorable little handmade book features 26 of the cutest animals and is perfect to read aloud to your little ones.
Each beautifully illustrated animal comes complete with it's own fun alliterative phrase to encourage your children to learn new words and to learn the alphabet in a fun and engaging way.
It's a unique birthday gift for any inquisitive, animal loving child or a gorgeous stationery gift for the adult who adores all things 'cute'!
I also do a cute stationery set of A to Z Alphabet Animal greeting cards 
http://etsy.me/2kwkEa8
All of my animal illustrations start life as meticulously hand-cut paper collages – very sharp implements and magnifying glasses are involved to make sure each creature is full of personality, expression and attitude – even the tiny ones. I then scan these collages to create pieces of digital artwork.
The book is 28 pages in total (26 animals and 2 cover pages) and is bound with clasps to ensure it stays in one piece! It is printed on a firm 300gsm silk card.
The whole package comes nestled neatly in a small kraft box and is a gorgeously cute gift.
Each page is 9cm x 9cm in size. The kraft box is 10cm x 10cm so the book fits snug-as-a-bug making a wonderful gift.
The 26 animals are: Armadillo, Bee, Cow, Donkey, Elephant, Fox, Giraffe, Hippo, Impala, Jackal, Kangaroo, Ladybug, Moose, Newt, Owl, Puffin, Quetzel, Rhino, Seahorse, Tapir, Unicorn, Vulture, Whale, XRay Tetra, Yak and Zebra.

## Please Note ##
The book is not safety tested and is not a toy. It is designed to be read aloud by a responsible adult and NOT designed to be left alone with children.

This beautiful BLANK handmade paper is made of 100% Cotton Rag using cotton textile remnants. This is NOT mass produced watercolor stock, but instead each piece is handmade on an individual screen. The color of the paper is a natural, unbleached white but may occasionally have tiny speckles of random color from other fibers mixed in the hand making process. All sizes are made from different batches of pulp, so there will be some natural variation in color among the pieces. The photographs with watercolor stain and calligraphy are examples of how this paper can be used.  All papers in my listings, including this one are BLANK.
As a calligrapher who works with a lot of papers, this is premium thick paper with a wonderful feel and tooth to it. All papers have been sized and are perfect for letterpress as well as appropriate for almost any use including pen and ink, drawing, colored or graphite pencils or light washes of watercolors. It will also work for mixed media.  Both weights of the paper will print on the top feed area of my personal inkjet printer using the envelope setting.  However, I cannot guarantee that your printer can handle them and suggest samples or blemished papers be used for any testing.  
The cotton edges are beautiful with a natural deckle NOT hand torn with the exception of the cotton rag envelopes.
These papers are offered as blanks.

You can use the colors by themselves or to deepen the tone of other colors. This all natural color has been filtered of harmful impurities. When used in clear bases, the color will not remain transparent.
A pastel color is produced in opaque (white) bases.
Solubility: Disperses in Water
Storage: Room temperature. Air tight container.
Product pH: Color will not change in products with a high pH. 
Matte: This color is not light sensitive /  Mica;: The colors are light sensitive
Color Migration: If product design has layered colors, this color will not migrate or “bleed” between layers. 
Non bleeding  / Does not Morph
Cosmetics: Add color directly to your base.
Melt & Pour (MnP) (MP) Soap: Add your color to a small amount of liquid glycerin. Mix well, then add amount desired to melted soap base. The more product you add the
darker your color will be. Some micas will work in cold process soap - but some will not. Their colors are sometimes unstable in the high ph of raw cold processed soap.  Do a small test batch first, or test out a little bit of mica in a little bit of lye water to see if the color shifts in that recipe.  Mica powder can used in an opaque base to make a light or Pastel color, but may have little to no sparkle as light is needed for the true reflective qualities of the micas to work properly.
***NOTE: If your bubbles or lather are not white you have used too much color. A little goes a long way. If you would like a true color, try using a clear soap. 
Do not over use this product.
Be sure to mix well. Speckling sometimes occur in MP (melt & pour).
The Pigment Powders can be used in:
Shower Gel
Lotions 
Bath scrubs
Mineral makeup base to create an eye shadow 
Approved for Cosmetics for Eyes  -customers often mix this with other ingredients
Lip Gloss (except for Blue Matte Ultramarine and Green Matte Chromium Dioxide Pigments)

Check out the example photos in the listing for some examples of bottle crafting!
A popular use for these bottles is as center pieces for weddings, parties, and other events. Add some twine, flowers, candles, twinkly lights, etc. and you have a beautiful centerpiece that is handmade, and not to mention, cheap! Can't get much better than that!

MATERIALS
GOLD-FILLED (hypoallergenic)
14K Gold fill is a pressure bonded layer of gold that has 100 times more gold than plated jewelry.  It is durable, won't chip or flake, is tarnish resistant, and a great alternative to ""solid"" gold jewelry that is reasonably priced.  Looks great and if taken care of should last for many years!
925 STERLING SILVER
Sterling Silver by definition is .925 silver.  It is a great silver option for those who don't wear gold.  Sterling silver will tarnish from oxidation but with the proper care and cleaning can be brought back to a shine.
Genuine Leather
...................................................
HOW TO PERSONALIZE
1. Select one of the metal / leather options in the first drop down
2. Choose your font in the second drop down
      upper block up to 3 stamps

PRODUCTION
- We usually ship orders within 3 business days

            This beautiful Bff necklace makes a great gift. Bff spelled out in dots and dashes will be a secret only you and her know. 
Dots and dashes are tiny,  14k gold filled, Rosegold filled or Sterling silver 3mm beads with 2mm tube beads strung on gold filled wire. It is strung on delicate chain.  
It is displayed on a decorative Morse code card.
Gold filled is a great economical alternative to solid gold. Gold filled is not to be confused with gold-plated. Gold filled is a layer of gold bonded to another metal. It has 100% more gold. Gold filled is tarnish resistant and more valuable. While gold-plated is a very thin layer coating that may wear off.
Jewelry Care
•Please note that proper care and maintenance is required to keep your jewelry beautiful. Jewelry does not like water so please remove before swimming or bathing. Please use lotions, perfumes, hairsprays, or other chemicals and let them dry before putting jewelry on. Chemicals will tarnish your beautiful pieces. Hang jewelry up or lay flat before sleeping so necklace or chains do not become tangled. Wipe jewelry off with a polishing cloth or use a mild cleanser often to keep pieces sparkling.

Hand stamped jewelry pieces are one of a kind and unique.  Although we take great care making each piece, stampings may not be perfectly aligned, centered, or spaced. This is part of the appeal and charm of being hand stamped.  We reject and recycle ones that don't meet our standard.

Barrette copper for medium to thick hair decorated with  malachite, agate, rose quartz. About the healing properties of copper has been known since ancient times.
Metal peace, harmony and art, equalizer and corrector. In ancient times, most works of art were made of copper or its alloys. And it is also no accident. Copper has healing and magical properties. It is able to identify and clarify our feelings. Copper is capable of making sense permanent and durable. It can convert unconsciously the elusive desire in a quite lucid affection and sympathy. And also, by analogy, to transform the unconscious rejection in quite lucid dislikes. At home copper: fine relationship, smooths conflicts.
