73,"Handmade Wooden Toys Folk Art Wooden Puppet, Hand Carved Wooden Marionette Puppet, Handmade Wooden Puppet, Folk Art Doll, FREE SHIPPING","
            This is a vintage 1940s hand carved folk art wooden puppet / wooden marionette. This handmade wooden toy depicts a seemingly grumpy, adorably frowning man with a top hat. This 1940s toy folk art doll is jointed at the shoulders, hips, and knees and has a single metal rod attached to his back to control his movement (not uncommon for primitive handmade marionette puppets). The eyes, eyebrows and ears are very simply drawn on, on this folk art wooden marionette, and the words ""hand carved"" are written on the back of his head. This handmade wood puppet also has written on the back of his body the puppet maker's name, (Russel Cartee) and the place (Greenup, KY) and date (4-11-44) of his creation. This hand carved folk art toy measures approximately 12.5"" tall, 3.25"" wide, and 1.5"" thick. The metal rod to control him is 17"" long. I don't know if it is removable. I haven't attempted it and I'm not going to. I don't want to damage this wonderful little guy.

81,"Vintage 1962 Bugs Bunny Jack-in-the-Box Toy in Near Pristine  Condition - Plays Hail, Hail, The Gangs All  Here","
            This vintage 1962 Bugs Bunny jack-in-the-box toy is in near-pristine 
condition.  The paint on all six sides is bright with no marring of the 
surfaces, no rust or dents.  The music box still plays the Ted Duncan 
arrangement of ""Hail, hail the gang's all here"" and Bugs pops up out of 
the box.  Bugs is sans ears, but still retains his cheeky ""What's up, 
Doc"" attitude!   This colorful, historical toy is perfect for Bugs Bunny 
collectors, Looney Tunes aficionados, or to decorate your 60s-style 
rabbit hole!
Ted Duncan got credit for the idea of the music-maker device within the 
Uke-A-Doodle. In the 1940s, Duncan was known in Hollywood for 
orchestrating music for several popular movies, but he also collected 
expensive Swiss music boxes as a hobby. In studying how music boxes 
operated, he came up with an idea for an affordable music-making device. 
He built a prototype and approached Mattel with his invention. Elliot 
Handler, president of Mattel, loved the device and not only added the 
music maker to the Uke-A-Doodle, but also included it in a variety of 
Mattel toys, most notably the Mattel Jack-In-The-Boxes.        ",100.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1960s

344,Vintage Paper Kite Dancing Oreo Cookie Graphic Wall Decor Two Stick Nabisco Advertising Camper Outdoor Family Kids Activity,"
            Paper Kite, off white with black graphics of a hip dancing Oreo cookie. Interesting Nabisco advertising piece. No makers marks like the other kites I have listed.  He reminds me of the California Raisins. I think this is a Hi Flier kite but perhaps after the company changed hands. Fun to fly or use as wall decor. I don't believe this was ever used as the kite was still rolled tightly, tied with string and the instructions are still rolled up with the kite. See photo 5. This kite and three others came in a mailing box that has the buyer's address typed on it. The kite is paper with a crinkly waxy covering.
Measures about 26 inches long. No tail is included. In very good vintage condition with some wrinkles, graphic and border color fading/staining and spots here and there.
I will be listing the other kites as well. I believe these have been rolled up since the person received them many years ago.
Please review all five photos for more info on condition.
Shipping is based on shipping to the coasts, any overage beyond 2.00 will be refunded once shipped. Insurance and tracking are included in the shipping cost. ALASKA and HAWAII buyers please contact me before purchasing to calculate your shipping costs.

345,Vintage Barney Kite String in Original Package  FREE U.S. SHIPPING,"
            This is the perfect gift for a 90s kid who was a fan of the Big Purple (in my opinion more of a pink or magenta) dinosaur. It's even in its original packaging-- I found it in a cabinet at my parent's house, it was probably picked up as a spare, my brother and I loved to fly kites, and even though neither of us were Barney fans (we used to tease my little cousin mercilessly about his Barney and Power Ranger afflictions) we would have used this spare string in a pinch because it's on a good holder, not one of the cheap plastic ones that came with the kites we'd buy at the supermarket. It would make a great gag gift for an adult--especially in March, a great time in so many places to fly kites, or for a trip to a destination like San Juan, PR where the trade winds make kite flying a year round hobby.

This rip-stop nylon kite consists of two components:  a 39.5"" x 68"" isosceles triangular-shaped ""SAIL"" and an 18""""HULL"" with STREAMERS (ie, waves of water?) connected by metal hooks; total assembled height is 58"". As to assembly: 
- the 38.5"" dowel with hooks spans across the center of the back of the sail (use grommets) 
- a pair of 3' dowels are inserted one each into the sides of the sail  
- a set of dowels with a connector are inserted into the top of the hull 
- the hull with streamers is attached at three points (grommets) to the sail.
Although there are two areas of minor spots, this is NOS (New Old Stock) having been on display in my toy shop and stored since it closed; it has never been flown.  Also, there is a tiny pinhole in the yellow part, most likely shipped thus.  It would be quite fun to fly in Rhode Island!        ",40.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1980s

5111,Early 1900's Bontems Bird in a Gilded Cage French Automaton,"
            This ""Bird in a Gilded Cage"" was made in France probably around 1910  or so.  It is a mechanical marvel that has been delighting admirers for generations with its flutter of activity: head turning, tail flapping and beak moving to the birds bright song.  Everything is original and I am always careful when soft-brush dusting the leaves and bird's feathers and the velvet floor to the cage. The brass hasn't been thoroughly polished in many years but is in great condition with no dings or dents.  The bottom is stamped ""Made in France"" with a number and the number 132 appears above the on/off operating lever.  On its feet the cage is 11 inches tall, 12 inches including its ring, and the base is about 6 inches wide.  
The price includes shipping within the United States.        ",695.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1910s

            Stump Table - Log stools and end tables that are beautifully sanded but preserve the natural characteristics of the tree. MADE TO ORDER - each one varies depending on the log character.
The wood is salvaged, standing dead, dry, lodgepole pine from the Colorado Rocky Mountains.We obtain non merchantable trees, not suitable for milling because they have too many knots, they're curved, or twisted and checked. These are trees that would otherwise be left in the forest to rot. Widths will vary somewhat from the described dimensions do to the nature of this being a natural product.
This is a log, a piece of an unprocessed natural tree, it has cracks, checks, knots, branches broken off, pieces splintered off, saw and tool marks from the harvesting process, and coloration and shapes will vary drastically from one tree to the next. If you are not okay with these natural variations then this product will not be right for you and we ask that you please refrain from ordering this. Please do read our shop policies, they are written to inform customers that might not be familiar with a natural product such as this as these variations might not be readily apparent from pictures in design magazines.
If you need sizes different than listed request a custom order.
If you'd like to try your hand at finishing these yourself we also offer them cut level on our mill, but unpeeled, unsanded, and unfinished:

8440,Pressed Botanical Ferns 12x18 in Handmade Frames,"
            This is a beautiful set of REAL pressed ferns, framed in either a simple but gorgeous handmade natural walnut, handmade poplar or hand finished antique black with gilded silver lip.  Each botanical is unique because nature makes them and no two press the same. The images I use are representative of the size and species of fern but the layout in the frame may vary.
Ferns in this set:
Feather Leaf Fern
Maidenhair Fern
Leather Leaf Fern
I can add vellum plant ID tags to all botanicals. If you would like ID tags added to this set please follow the link provided and purchase the corresponding number of ID tags to go with this purchase. 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/464331302/add-id-tags-to-botanicals-only-purchased?ref=shop_home_active_1
I mount the pressed ferns to a museum grade cotton rag matboard using archival, pH neutral glue. All of my framing is done using acid-free backing and UV filtering glass.
The finished size of each piece is about  12.75""x18.75"".
The frames are handmade from either solid walnut or poplar that I source locally and mill myself. The basic profiles are a thin, mid-century modern style that compliments the botanicals but doesn't detract from their natural beauty. The Walnut is finished to allow the natural beauty of the wood to show through. The poplar is offered in a black or gray finish that imparts the feel of a set of frames from generations ago. For the person looking for a very authentic 19th century look, the antique black with gilded silver lip is a gorgeous option. I finish and gild the frames in my shop, made to order, which is what sets these apart from any imported, mass produced frame. The attention to detail on all my frames will definitely be something you will notice! 
TO PURCHASE INDIVIDUALLY PLEASE SEE MY OTHER LISTINGS. I have many other botanical listings so be sure to favorite my shop and check out my other listings!        ",335.00,5.0,"Handmade item

10197,"Professional Fire Poi (4"" Solar Flare™) kevlar (full set of 2)","
            Advanced poi spinners are saying these are the best poi they have ever used. You are paying for Quality.   It is not uncommon for Solar Flare™ knots to last for years.
These are our BEST SELLING item.  We have been selling this design for 6 years.  It's got a long burn time, makes a big flame, and is very durable. 
You are paying for quality.  To my knowledge I am the only maker still hand sewing each wick, which means they get the inspection and care they deserve with no exposed hardware to burn you.
Every poi set I sell comes with STAINLESS STEEL ball chain.  People hear about ball chain breaking.  In every case I know of, broken ball chain was NICKEL PLATED STEEL.  GET STAINLESS STEEL CHAIN.  My stainless steel ball chain is the same stainless chain used by the top manufacturers.  We have never had a failure.
The Solar Flare™ Fire Poi design provides maximum durability with maximum fire. 4"" will get 4-6 minute burn time depending on spinning style.
LENGTH: Length is the TOTAL length of the FULL setup, from the bottom of the head to the end of the handles.
Preferred length is different for everyone.  If you don't know what length is right for you, measure from your middle knuckles to your ankle, with your arm straight at your side. For most this is between 21-28 inches.

            This Waldorf baby doll is traditionally handmade, so that your Waldorf doll feels 'right', will last & provide a lifetime of daily play and become a beloved family heirloom.
""A doll is an image of a human being and is therefore the toy most suited to develop and enliven the self-image in the growing child"" ~ Freya Jaffke
♥ Traditionally made doll, Classic Waldorf doll construction
♥ Approximately 30cm / 12"" - One of A Kind
♥ In the Waldorf tradition, 'soft dolls' or 'formed dolls' are made with brushed cotton, with simple faces and hands and are intended as 'first dolls' for children over the age of four. 
♥ Pale pink / Rose coloured clothing
♥ Hood is sewn to head, over hair and sleeves are sewn alongside hands
♥ Delicate, pale peach hands and face
♥ The blonde hair is created from mohair bouclé yarn
✨ ""This Waldorf inspired soft doll has been handcrafted by Qualified and Experienced Waldorf teacher and doll maker Yun-Hsuan. A dear friend to Hinterland Mama and truly beautiful person in her own right. I know your doll has been calmly created with absolute love, care and attention to detail. Love Aleta x "" ✨
This Waldorf baby doll shall come to you requiring a signature on delivery. 
ღ As you will see, she IS THAT special ღ
Care: Please wash your Waldorf baby doll as little as possible. The inevitable dirty mark can be taken care of with a damp, soft wash cloth. You will remove the stain most effectively by pressing and patting the stain away, rather than rubbing strongly.

            ABOUT BUSY BOARDS
The busy board is both a great developmental tool and an engaging fun toy for children ages 10 months to 3 years. Watch your little one play for hours while learning about the world around them!
Leave it on the floor or hang it on the wall -- the busy board is high quality, durable product that can be enjoyed for years and years. 
Follow the link for a step by step guide to purchasing an item: 
https://www.etsy.com/ca/help/article/339
 
CUSTOMIZE YOUR BUSY BOARD
Personalize your busy board by putting your child’s name on it and by choosing either a gender specific or gender neutral theme. In the ""NOTE"" section of your cart please indicate your color scheme (boys', girls', gender neutral) and your child's name. If your child's name is longer than 5 letters we recommend the 22x30"" board to fit their full name across the board. Listed below are the standard features of our busy boards. 
The standard stations on our 18x24” busy board (as pictured on the Naya & Clark boards) are: Letters spelling out your child’s name, a door that reveals a (non-glass) mirror behind it, a wheel, a zipper, a call bell, a bottle cap, a door chain, a barrel bolt, a padlock, a phone receiver, and a door knocker. In addition to the listed stations, our 22x30” busy board (as pictured on the Summer & Vincent boards) may also include: A light switch, a combination lock, a deadbolt lock and/or a door handle, a bubble mirror, stackable spoons, and a tambourine. Every busy board is a unique made to order piece. Each board is one of a kind and may vary from the one pictured above.
Great care is taken to make sure our boards are child safe. Every board is sanded to a smooth finish and there are no protruding sharp edges from any of the objects included on the board. However, as with any toy, for child's safety, adult supervision is necessary when playing.        ",100.00,4.8889,"Handmade item

10751,"5 Yearbook Luminaries, Reunion Decor, Custom Made From Your Yearbook Pages, Decor for High School & College Reunions, Retro, Class Reunion","
            Old school Reunion decorations! Pictures shown are from custom orders I did using photocopied yearbook pages. Glossy photocopies look awesome! That way you don't have to use your actual yearbook pages! Contact me if interested and I will explain how we coordinate getting your pages to me.
Great for high school and college reunions. Would also be cool for black & white themed events retro parties and graduations! Very unique centerpieces!
I love yearbooks and the idea of nostalgia, and it got me thinking that these would make great hipster retro decorations for parties. For custom orders people usually mail me their yearbook pages to use their actual yearbook, or mail me photocopied pages from their yearbook to make luminaries from. 
This listing is for 5 custom made yearbook luminary bags. I used star cutouts but can do any shape you see in my shop. Yearbook confetti and other yearbook decorations available in my shop under shop section ""reunion/yearbook bags""
Candles are not included, but you can find them very inexpensive at your local craft store, for use with fake candles only. If you want more or less luminaries just convo me, I can setup a listing for any amount for you. 10 bag listing in my shop.
I will make your luminaries as large as I can depending on the size of your yearbook. Approx dimensions are 9-10""h, 5-6""w, 2""d for large books and 7""h, 4""w, 2""d for smaller books.
Please read my shop policies, thank you!

10872,Let It Snow! Photoshop Action Christmas Overlay,"
            Prepare to be amazed! Our Uplift ""Let It Snow"" Photoshop action is not like anything you've used before. It's not an overlay, but an actual action that renders incredibly realistic, adjustable snow on your photos! And get this – EVERY time you run the action, you'll get different results and a new set of snow! Just like a snowflake – no two are the same! This is a HUGE benefit if you're editing a series of photos to ensure the snow is believable and real – and not just the same overlay on every photo. You can adjust all 7 layers of snow and quickly paint out any areas where you don't want flakes. Bring on the winter sessions – let it snow! 
You can also get this action in our WINTER Bundle for Photoshop (and save!):

            «Chain dragged by the paved floor of a castle, holes in sheets, boring pianos, shadows Green through the lobby, faces disfigured behind the glass of a window, photos with surprise guests... The iconography around the Ghost is rich and varied.

12197,"Automatic watch cuff links, mechanical watch, vintage cufflinks, engineer gift, husband gift, watch gear cufflinks, watch movement steampunk","
            These are WORKING watch movement steampunk cuff links. The watch movement is durable stainless steel, and the casing is durable metal alloy coated in either gold, silver, or black. Many Etsy sellers sell cuff links that don't actually ""work"" / move, so beware. We also offer discounts when buying more for special occasions! Message us for a specific quantity discount. 
The open face concept with the flashy mechanical skeleton design is super sleek. The durable stainless steel is great for everyday wear, yet the hint of luxury and elegance is perfect for special occasions. The high quality mechanical movement is eye-catching: You'll be staring at it for hours! 
This watch includes a black gift box with a bow: great for gifting to groomsmen, boyfriends, fathers and husbands.
These are all mechanical and have no battery! Although technology today is amazing, ANYONE can appreciate the elegance of a mechanical watch.
Specs (approx):
Approximately 3/4"" in diameter, black, gold or silver plating.
Package Contents:
x2 Watch Movement Cuff links
x1 Gift Box w/ Bow
Important Notes:
Please keep the watch movement away from magnets since the components are fine gear work and mechanical in nature. These are not water proof.
SET OF 4 (At a discount since purchasing more):
MESSAGE us for a different quantity, please.
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
Since the cuff links are mechanical, please do the following steps:
1. Wind the knob clockwise to wind the cuff link. The winding will give you many hours of run time but the motion of wearing it will keep it going. 
3. Done! Put on the cuff links and begin the enjoyment of wearing them. They're great for any occasion, especially weddings!

♡ PRODUCTION PROCESS 
We will tell you about the process in which our terrariums are born. At first we create the 3D sample using the software “Autodesk 3ds Max”. Then, the image is transposed to the transparent glass, 2mm thick and is very carefully cut by hand. After that, all the details are grinded and wrapped with a special foil. After that there comes the most responsible stage of soldering separate pieces of glass into the shape with ideal proportions. And the final stage – wash thoroughly, grind the seams, patinize (color the seams) and fix. Then the ready terrarium is carefully polished and placed into its personal packaging for the safe transportation and is sent to its new home :-)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
♡ PRODUCTION PERIOD 
Each terrarium is produced personally for you. From the very beginning and till the ready item – it is handmade. Therefore, we will need some time to send your order. Generally the production period takes 4-8 days, depending upon the order complexity and our load. As soon as your order is sent – you receive the notification from Etsy on your mail.

Further info regarding raw timber products:
These are rustic in character. 
Most products are made from burned and standing timber from the Black Forest, Colorado Fire of 2013. The wood has been air dried, sanded on one side, and varnished completely, and cracks are normal, often one larger and a few smaller, occasionally even after finishing. They are semi-fragile and should be handled and stored with care. Occasionally bark will chip off or come loose and can easily be fixed with wood glue and a large rubber band. All products are hand-crafted, not factory made so color and shape variations are common. Every piece is unique. Some slight curving or twisting is also possible. Very rarely a tiny grub bug remains in the product, so a slice of cardboard or cloth is advised on the cake stands.        ",39.00,4.6957,"Handmade item

            This is a custom made shawl.  It is not ready to ship. Please contact me to discuss prior to placing your order.
This lovely shawl is the perfect accessory for your wedding to give you a little cover over your gown.
 
My shawl is knit in a beautiful soft wool blend yarn; it is 20% merino wool, 80% acrylic.  The shawl fastens with an ivory satin ribbon which ties into a bow. You may have your choice of ribbon color.

            ♥ Bridesmaid dress in red or festive dresses ♥
Love yourself and your red infinity dress. This wonderful red stretch dress is easy to wear anywhere and anytime. Are you invited to a wedding? Are you looking for a bridesmaid dress or do you need for the next summer party just a long red all-purpose dress to the attention. Then this dress is just right for you.
The best thing about this dress is that you can wrap it in many different ways, so it can also be worn at many events without the same appearance. PERFECT I'd say. The other dresses show how the wonderful wrap dress can still be tied. However, Youtube videos show that there are over 90 different carrier possibilities! The Infinity dress has a unit size and corresponds to the sizes XS to L. It can also be used as a circumstance mode, as the material is stretch and it admirably admits.
I am looking forward to your order. If you have any questions about this wonderful long dress, then maile me :-)

L 'estrattore di Soxhlet viene usato nella determinazione dei grassi liberi e totali negli alimenti, analisi dei pesticidi, dei legni e delle plastiche. L' estrazione avviene riscaldando il solvente contenuto nel matraccio, dopo che il campione è stato posto nel ditale filtrante nell' interno dell' estrattore. I vapori sviluppati dal calore salgono lungo il tubo laterale, entrano nel corpo centrale per poi salire nel refrigerante. Nel refrigerante si condensano e ricadono allo stato liquido nel ditale, riempendo mano a mano l' estrattore fino al livello del sifone, il quale a sua volta scaricherà il liquido nel matraccio.

• IMPORTANT READ ABOUT: Our Strict Disclaimer And Design Limitations Regarding Industry Standard Woven Labels.
This is industry standard for woven labels. With weaving, it is impossible to have 100% detail to match your graphic art, as these are literally stitched/woven labels and NOT printed labels.  
The size after cut and folded finished both have -2mm tolerances. The colors of yarn can have tolerances of up to15%.   please note that vertical line, horizontal line  circles, curves and slants are very tough with weaving, it will have a step to the next stitch line in the weaving process. Also, some letters may be larger, etc.   
If you need 100% matching of fine detail, no color of yarn ""peeking"" through a white background from yarn, you need printed labels instead of premium woven. The yarn/threads of woven labels may have different thicknesses hence limitations to some fine detail. By ordering woven labels you understand and agree with these industry standard tolerances and are approved by you the customer upon placing this order. The method of weaving labels involves moving parts and moving loom machinery and therefore the possibility of the above variances These are NOT printed labels!  While we try our best to avoid any tolerance, these tolerances above are industry standard for all woven labels.        ",100.00,4.9051,"Handmade item

16855,Tennessee Whiskey Barrel and Ebony Wood Ring - Whiskey Barrel Ring Mens Wedding Band Womens Wooden Wedding Engagement Ring Wood Anniversary,"
            A unique solid wood ring for the whiskey drinker in your life!
This is a hand-turned oak and ebony wood ring cut from used Jack Daniels whiskey barrels combined with dark black Gaboon ebony wood, custom made to your specifications - choose the size, width, and shape from the options to create your own handmade ring!  Your ring will have a similar look to those in the pictures but each ring is a unique piece of wood with it's own unique patterning with no two exactly alike!  Please note the variability in coloring in the photos, your ring may be lighter or darker than the first image.
 If you'd prefer a ring with just whiskey barrel wood that doesn't include the ebony edges, check out the other options available in my shop: 
http://www.hawkinshandicrafts.etsy.com
After a Jack Daniels barrel is no longer of use to the distillery, it is sold to a number of craftsmen who make everything from planters to knife handles from the wood - or, in this case, a solid wood ring.   I purchase the barrels straight from the distillery general store and have them shipped to my doorstep, where I dismantle them into individual staves to be cut into rings.
  
Each ring is hand polished and finished with several layers of cyanoacrylate.  While many crafters use oils and waxes to finish their rings, cyanoacrylate provides a stronger bond within the wood grain, provides protection from water, and reduces the likelihood of scratching - a common issue with other finishing materials.
To order a pair of rings:  add the first ring to your cart with the correct size/shape information, return to this page, then add another ring with the second size/shape information.
Dimensions:
Ring Size:  5-13.  If you need a larger or smaller size, please inquire using the ""Ask a Question"" button in the Cart area of the page.
Width:  6mm-9mm
Processing times:  Processing times change depending on my current backlog.  Please see the shop announcement on my homepage for current times to ship!
As with all wood rings, this material is less durable than a traditional metal ring, but with proper care and maintenance, it will look beautiful and last for years!
Size exchanges:  We offer the first size exchange free for residents of the United States (return shipping of the original is your responsibility).  Further alterations to size will incur an additional fee to cover the cost of shipping and handling.        ",100.00,4.8901,"Handmade item

17239,Quartz Ear Weights | Copper Earweights | Crystal Point Ear Jewelry | Hoop Earrings | Plug Tunnel Lobes | Pagan Witch | Minimalist Gothic,"
            This listing is for one pair of Quartz Point crystal earweights in oxidized copper. To be worn through tunnel or eyelet jewelry in stretched lobes 2g or larger. Not for unhealed or freshly stretched bare lobes. Wear in fully healed bare lobes 0g or larger only. 
These are raw, natural crystal points and while they are hand-selected to create roughly matched pairs, they are not identical, but have unique characteristics.   The copper is polished to a shine and oxidized, and the patina will continue to evolve over time.
They measure 2 1/4"" in diameter on the outside, and 2"" in diameter on the inside.  The copper wire is 3mm thick. The Quartz crystals are 1 1/2"" tall and just under 1"" wide.  
Each weight weighs 30 grams.
From the Cold Forest Collection: Ice Drops.
When the Sun moves low in the sky, the Ice Queen emerges from her caves in the North to descend over the tips of mountains, across treelines, deep into valleys and streams. She moves like a whisper and silences the rushings of life with her white blankets. Caught in her grasp, transfixed for ages, trees turn to brittle splinters, and water as hard as stone.

•••
ELECTRO MAGICK:
 I create jewelry and curiosities by ""growing"" copper onto crystals and other organics using an alchemical hybrid process:  Electroforming.  In my cauldron of neon blue electrolyte solution, I brood over, coax, and observe my creations as they begin to take shape.  The process takes twelve hours, up to three days, with each piece forming bumps, nodules, lines, and deep grooves along the way.  Some of my pieces are darkened with a Liver of Sulfur solution and polished with oil; others are left shiny and bare.  All of my pieces are left unsealed, which allows them to continue to age and oxidize, giving you a living, breathing adornment that is truly dynamic and ever-changing.
CARE FOR YOUR PIECE: 
  Please handle your handmade jewelry with care; avoid dropping it or inflicting heavy trauma or stress. While copper is sturdy enough for daily wear, it is a softer metal and can be misshapen under stress. Crystals and gemstones, especially in raw form, also need to be treated kindly. Avoid submersion in water and direct exposure to lotions, oils, perfumes, and harsh cleaners. These can permanently discolor some stones or tarnish the copper. To clean your jewelry, simply buff gently with a soft cloth to remove perspiration and oils.  Some people with certain chemistry experience temporary discoloration of the skin when wearing copper jewelry, especially on the fingers and the back of the neck. This is the ""Green Ghost"" of oxidation and can be washed off the skin with soap and warm water, if you desire.

18029,Linen Corset Belt,"
            Lace up corset style belt in off white canvas.
This belt is made of a thick off white canvas fabric with finished seams. I personally like the way the canvas wrinkles because it adds to the look, but it does iron out. Try pairing it with a white shirt or dress. Or do it up Prada style over a jacket.
Off White Canvas/Silver Eyelets/Off White Flat Lacing
SIZING:
Our sizing is just a suggestion. You may want to wear your belt with wider lacing, or have it lace up tighter. Measure your waist over the clothing you want to wear with the belt. Choose the size at that measurement or a couple of inches below.
*THIS BELT IS NOT A CORSET. It is a decorative accessory. Please do not pull excessively on the laces.*
Size options:
24"" Belt
27"" Belt
30"" Belt
*Larger and smaller sizes are available by request*
This belt is approx. 7"" wide with 2m of lacing.
Model: 5'6"" with 35"" bust, 29"" waist & 40"" booty - wearing MEDIUM

___________________________________________________________
I am doing a something little different in my shop! Stretched ears are becoming very popular. The history of stretching ears is a sacred art to many tribes. Such as in African tribes stretch ears to show how long/or how many years they have been in a tribe for. King tut in Ancient Egypt Stretched his ears and this is visible on most all his photos, statues, and images. Most Buddhist stretch their ears to gain awareness to the universe around them and to open their psychic or third eye senses.

            Soccasins! More of an *indoor slipper or sock (Hence, the name Soccasin) than a durable outdoor moccasin. Our unique Soccasins are weightless, comfortable, simple, and so comfortable to wear! Slide right in to this below-ankle slip-on moccasin and enjoy! Each Soccasin is made from one piece of soft and supple leather, folded over and sewn to snugly fit your foot. They're so close to being barefoot you won't even notice you have them on! Adorning every one of them is a signature Tread Light leaf (removable) slid on to the lace to carry a bit of nature with you wherever you go.
*Suitable for light outdoor use. Many of our customers LOVE to make use of our Soccasins for 'grounding' or 'earthing' shoes. They're perfect for walking in the grass or along the beach! 
What is Earthing? The term Earthing, also known as grounding, is based on research that demonstrate that connecting to Earth’s electrical energy promotes physical well being. The act of Earthing refers to a physical connection between the electrical frequencies of the human body with that of Earth’s (think barefoot in the grass, or at the beach). Just like the sun constantly provides us with energy and vitamins, the earth too is a source of subtle energy that contributes to optimum health.
Is it true? Is it false? We don't know, but people who are in to it can't get enough of our ultra comfortable handmade Soccasins! Try them out and see for yourself!

            Please read this section carefully: 
This listing INCLUDES the cost of low top canvas Converse All Stars, in one of your top 3 color choices, if they are available in the size and shade you would like.  In addition, this listing includes embroidery on your choice of one of the following locations - Please choose one: 
1. both outside arches of the pair OR
2. the tongue of both shoes OR 
3. the inside arch on both shoes. 
Please let me know which location you would like your stitching on! 
Pricing  on additional stitching begins at 14 (and up) per pair. 
Custom Converse are perfect for a wedding, gift for a friend, bridesmaids, groomsmen, flower girls, ring bearers, or yourself! Custom Chucks are wonderful to personalize with embroidery.  
For this listing only, one pair of low top, canvas Converse All Stars standard colors, with embroidery (see specifics above) included in the price of the listing.  Please let me know your top 3 color choices. 
Not all colors are available at all times in all sizes, and Converse occasionally retires a color for a season. If that happens, I will let you know right away and work with you to either find an available color in your size, or provide a quick refund.   I aim to please, and if they can be acquired, I will happily do so. 
Sometimes there are other colors of converse that may be available - those would cost slightly more - please contact me if you would like another color and I can create a special listing for those colors. 
**Once shoes are acquired by me there are no refunds.  
**Please triple check spelling and color choices on your order before you approve final design.  Any change requests (after final design has been approved by you) will be subject to 25 per change fee.  
How this works: 
1. You place the order. Let me know what color shoes and what size (please specify men or women's size!) you would like.  I will get to work on finding your shoes!  If I can't find them I will get back to you right away so we can figure out if you would like to choose another color. I will either get the shoes or let you know I can't. 
2. Once I have the shoes you would like, I will begin working with you on design options.   You will get to choose wording of short phrases (names, dates, small graphics) and thread colors, and letter height (smaller or larger).  I will provide you with an initial sketch and make adjustments until you are happy.  
3. You approve a final draft.  **Please note that any change requests after the final draft has been approved will be subject to 25 per change fee**
4. I begin work on your shoes!  Stitching takes up to 2 weeks per pair, after I have the shoes in hand and we have agreed on a final design.   (Let me know if you want a rush - sometimes I can work that out!) 
5. I will mail the shoes to you via FEDEX with a tracking number and insurance.        ",100.00,4.9863,"Handmade item

CHUCK TAYLOR ALL STAR ORIGINS
Created in 1917 as a non-skid basketball shoe, the All Star was originally promoted for its superior court performance by basketball mastermind Chuck Taylor. But over the decades, something incredible happened: The sneaker, with its timeless silhouette and unmistakable ankle patch, was organically adopted by rebels, artists, musicians, dreamers, thinkers and originals.
Please note the last photo, as the shoe color has changed slightly, the eye wholes for the shoe laces on all new shoes will be completely white or more monochromatic than in the pictures of the dyed shoes. Thank you.
