Product Information
As with many other essential oils, pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid using lavender essential oil. It is also recommended that patients with diabetes stay away from lavender oil. It may also cause allergic reactions to people that have unusually sensitive skin. Some people may also witness nausea, vomiting and headaches due to either common or excessive use of lavender oil.
Perhaps most importantly, lavender oil should never be ingested, only topically applied or inhaled through means of aromatherapy or similar activities. Ingestion can cause serious health complications, characterized by blurred vision, difficult breathing, burning eyes, vomiting, and diarrhea. So, even if you think that lavender oil is a wonderful miracle cure, don’t get excited and start putting it on your food!
 
 
A Final Word of Warning
Despite the versatility of this particular essential oil, it is important to never consume essential oils internally. Inhalitation in the form of aromatherapy is safe in certain situations, but it is always better to speak with an herbalist or an aromatherapist before embarking on this sort of alternative treatment. Also, due to high concentration of chemicals in these oils, undiluted oils can bet very powerful and dangerous when your skin is directly exposed to it.        ",5.25,4.9333,"Handmade item

            CONSTELLATIONS - IPHONE 4/4s CASE OR IPHONE 5/5S/SE CASE
Pretty stars make for a beautiful constellations case.
Our original artwork is hand printed over a metal cover with a method that ensures a high quality and long lasting print. We carefully hand print each of our cases, so you might get some pattern displacement from the picture you’re seeing, but this just adds to the uniqueness of it. The print has a shimmery finish, wich protects from fading and scratching.
Once printed, the metal cover is placed over a base case. You have 2 choices for the base material:
- Hard Plastic - Clear: very slim and lightweight, has a ""barely there"" feel adding style with no bulk. It offers basic protection against scratches and shock, but if you drop your phone too often this case might crack (1st and 4th picture for reference and details)
- Rubber - Clear or Black: a little bulkier, but it gives a better protection to your iPhone. It absorbs more shock that a hard plastic case, and it protects all 4 sides and the screen (2nd, 3rd and 5th picture for reference and details)
The finished product is a snap on case with a snuggly fit. It is made to fit the iPhone 4/4s, iPhone 5/5s or iPhone SE with easy access to all of your iPhone’s features.

10125,Dual Twist Hand Spinner Ceramic Bearing - Bar - Fidget Toy - EDC **FAST SHIPPING!**,"
            *** IMPORTANT CAP COLOR CHANGE:
By default, the color of your caps will be the same as the Primary color.  If you want a different color for the caps, please leave a note of what color you would like the caps during checkout! ***
Ever catch yourself tapping your pen, or fiddling with a random object just to keep your hands busy?  If so, this 3d printed spinner toy is for you and will keep your hands satisfied! 
This Dual-Twist bar spinner comes with ONE high quality Titanium or Hybrid Ceramic center bearing, TWO high quality Black steel 608 outer bearings, and TWO center bearing curved magnetic caps.   The magnetic caps are easily removed with a little force, which makes cleaning the center bearing a breeze!
(Dimensions: 80mm long x 27mm wide x 7mm tall)
The 3d printed body and caps both have smooth edges that are pleasing to touch.  No sharp edges here!  All spinners come assembled and ready to spin! 
Here is a quick video of the spinner in action:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qiyJBPsURs&t
BEARING OPTIONS:
No Bearings - This option does not come with bearings.  You can install your own 608 bearings into the spinner body and use the included caps
Titanium bearing - This option is for those wanting a quieter spin.  Spin times are slightly shorter than ceramic, but still offers a satisfying smooth spin
Hybrid Ceramic - This bearing has ZrO2 ceramic balls with a nylon cage and steel races.  Spin times with this bearing are faster and longer than the Titanium(The Ceramic bearing does come with some sound).
Full Ceramic - This is the best of both worlds.  Slightly smoother than the Hybrid Ceramic, the full ceramic offers an fast and long spins.  This bearing will also never rust!
