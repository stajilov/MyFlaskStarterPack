386,"The ""ORIGINAL Vachina"" Vagina coin purse MATURE LISTING! fanny, muff, genitals, snatch, beaver, vajay-jay, hens gift, gag gift, funny gift","
            These are cliterally the funniest thing on Facebook and Etsy at the moment.....
Witness the birth of 
THE NOT MADE IN CHINA ""VACHINA"" that has now gone viral AGAIN! And now again..... Seriously... How many viral outbreaks can a girl handle?! 
This is the perfect way to store lots of things, keep tampons handy and snug inside, condoms so you can surprise and delight your partner what you pull on out of your Vachina, spare coins, keys, plastic babies, head phones, dead gold fish, diva cups.... 
Anything you can think of really, you could store in your Vachina! This will open a whole new world of storage solutions for you and your friends!
She measures 10cm in diameter (let's not confuse this with dilation) and including the lobster clip, is 16cm long total. 
(That's 4inches in diameter by 6 inches for imperial folk) her zipper opening is approx 8cm long and she can open up nice and wide too to fit larger items. 
(Small variations may occur due to the handmade natural nature of the Vachina) 
And these are inclusive Vachinas too we currently offer 4 pubic hair colour options being
Blonde
Light Brown
Dark Brown
Black
Limited Ginger (out of stock currently) 
AND  4 skin tone options
Milky pale
Tan and terrific
Hot Hispanic 
Dark cocoa 
And inside is just as important too! Choose from
Crushed Velvet in pink
Cool cotton in pink
(Shade of pink will vary) 
**PLEASE LEAVE A SELECTION IN THE NOTES TO SELLER OR I WILL MAIL A DEFULT SKIN TONE OF MILKY PALE EXTERIOR  AND PINK COTTON LINING!!**
BUT WAIT... There is more!!! 
You can then also chose which style Vachina you need in your life! 
The Tidy Twat
A beautifully manicured V design pubic hair zip up pouch, with delicate top stitching and fully lined with your choice of crushed velvet or cotton. This is the most classy of all the Vachinas. She's timeless and elegant, and wouldn't be out of place on 5th avenue. 
The overly manicured Muff
She's smooth cotton all over, apart from a little landing strip that extends to the lobster clip. With the option of a ""clitoral hood"" piercing.... She is the most daring out of all the Vachinas! She's fun, sassy and a real go-getter! 
And last, but not least,
The 70s Porno Pussy.
She's big, she's bold, she's brash... She may need a double appointment with her waxer one day, but she embraces her hair with a passion! She looks amazing lined with crushed velvet and her zipper and zipper pull just peeking through... It's retro at its finest!
All my Vachinas come with a little ""hood"" on the top of the pale pink zipper that you can customise with a piercing if you desire.... I have sparkle, pearls and silver just leave a note to seller with your choice if you would like this!  Guaranteed it is less painful than the real deal!
Zipper colour be pale pink and will have a contrasting zipper pull, so the obvious can be easily found 😉 (I wish it was easier for some)
And they come with a little lobster clip so you can clip it to your keys, handbag... Almost anywhere...use your imagination! Ok... Maybe that's a little too far... 
Select your options at the checkout and design your very own Vachina!! Don't wait! 
If you have a special needs Vachina, message me and I will see if I can accommodate you! 
On Mondays, (cross that part out! All day every day currently) we make Vachinas!
All Vachinas will come packaged in discreet brown paper, so your postie won't know, unless you open it up in front of them...unless you want to, I guess.... 
Buy one for your mum! Your bestie! Your sister! Your neighbour! Your boss.... Ok... Maybe not your boss....that may breech a few rules....
And the best part, is that because I hand make each Vachina in my Not Made in a China ""sweat shop"" no two will ever be identical.... Kinda like the real thing I guess 😉
If you can't wait and need express postage, message me and I'll sent up a custom Listing with express post!
Live outside of Australia? I totally ship world wide and will take great delight in filling in your customs declaration forms! -***

            The 3/8"" collars are perfect for cats, kittens, teacup and very small dog breeds. They can be made with 2 types of buckles.
⇩ Please read below to determine which type best suits your pet. ⇩
CAT BUCKLES:
This option uses Breakaway Safety Buckles that are made to release with the right amount of tension. If the collar gets caught on something, the cats twisting and pulling will cause the buckle to pop open and free the cat. However, this feature makes them unsafe to use with a leash.
DOG BUCKLES:
This option uses Standard (Non-Breakaway) Buckles that can be used with a leash.

This collar is handmade with:
• Nylon webbing
• Fabric/Ribbon
• Black plastic breakaway OR standard buckle
• Metal D-ring
• Black plastic slide (adjusts collar length)
• Gold bell (optional)

            Organic Crystal Infused Structurized Yoni Steam
Structurize your water with the healing energy of crystals and take your yoni steam to the next level!
Molecularly structured water is believed to have many health benefits and improves the vitality of both plants and animals. Science is beginning to catch up with what has always been known within the mystic traditions and is now starting to recognize the healing power of water. More now than ever it is so important to work with this element. Water listens, it is receptive to prayer, it holds memories, and it connects us everything. Programming your water with energies such as thought, prayer, light, or by using crystals actually changes its molecular structure in a way that amplifies the health of all living things. We all have the ability to harness this sacred water as a conduit of enlightenment and global healing. 
Add this power to your yoni steam! 
Crystal Infused Structurized Yoni Steam combines organic herbs known for their healing properties  (Lavender, Rose Buds & Petals, Oregano, Calendula, and Rosemary) with actual pieces of Rose Quartz. Quartz Crystals are known to structurize water and are a wonderful way to encode your yoni steam with the wisdom and healing energy of crystals. Crystal infused yoni steams send love and healing to your sacred womb space while infusing your core with the spiritual medicine held within these elements. 
 
To prepare your crystal infused yoni steam simply place crystals in a pitcher or bowl of water and allow it to sit in the sun or moonlight for several hours; this is also a wonderful time to pray over your water or to whisper your intentions. You can then use this water to prepare your yoni steam as usual. You can also mix in the crystals directly with your yoni steaming herbs as they are being prepared over heat. You will want to bring this mixture to a slight boil, reduce the heat, and allow to simmer for at least 20 minutes. 
There are many ways to do the actual steam. Some women use a sitzbath placed over the bowl of their toilet, some simply squat over the steam, I prefer to place my pot under an old chair that I have removed the seat from. It is important to wrap yourself in blankets allowing the steam to become trapped within. You also want to keep your shoulders, neck, and feet warm during this process. *ALWAYS ALWAYS CHECK THE TEMPERATURE OF THE STEAM AND TAKE SPECIAL CARE NOT TO BURN YOURSELF!* This practice is especially beneficial if done right before bed so that the healing process can continue while your body rests. If you can, it is a wonderful practice to return the water, herbs, and crystals back to the earth or into a body of water. This perpetuates the cycle of interconnectedness in a way that brings healing to ourselves, the water, the plants, the earth, and to everything around us!

****Care instructions
Our products are made of steel/metal, and powder coated to last for years to come. This means that most of my products are shatterproof and UV-resistant! Clean with mild soap and water.
****Sizing details
We can cut any item from 2 inches, up to 10 foot without piecing. We off priority shipping with a flat rate of 11.00, up to 30 inches. If an item exceeds 30 inches, the customer is liable for the shipping cost.
****Why powder coating instead of other painting methods?
Powder Coating is more durable and is safe for the environment. It gives consumers, businesses, and industries one of the most economical, longest lasting, and most color-durable quality finishes available on virtually any type of metal. Powder coated surfaces are more resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing than other finishes. Color selection is virtually unlimited with flat, satin, gloss, high gloss, metallic, candies, clear, iridescent, fluorescent, wrinkle, hammer tone, and glitter finishes available. Colors stay bright and vibrant longer. Texture selections range from smooth surfaces to wrinkled or matte finishes, and rough textures. It's bendable too!
****Isn't metal too heavy?
Not at all! Most of our 24-inch monograms and wall decor are less than 4 pounds.
****Why Metal instead of wood?

9029,Fresh Whipped Silky Natural Body Butter Choose Your Scent   - 4 oz.,"
            I have been working on this recipe for a long time and it is now perfected! The perfect silky, moisturizing body butter that leaves your skin feeling smooth ALL DAY! This body butter glides on your skin smoothly and is all natural.  A combination of cocoa and shea butter, along with sweet almond oil and vitamin E, it is packed with skin nurturing ingredients 
A little goes a long way, this is a  4 oz jar and lasts much longer than the store bought stuff twice or three times its size. This product is made to order, so you are always getting a fresh product - no water added, only intensive moisture that will last throughout the day!
I also make all my body butters and creams with the highest quality fragrance and essential oils that last throughout the day! There is nothing like smelling just as amazing at the end of a long day as you did just putting on the cream in the morning!
I make my body butters with no preservatives and no water added, so all you are putting on your skin is those amazing butters and oils, with no added chemicals! This results in a thicker body butter that melts on your skin on contact and lasts a while since you don't need as much as some thinned down butters that add water. 
Note: 
Because of the all natural ingredients in this body butter, during the hot months there could be a chance of the softening or melting of some of the product. I do not include an artificial stabilizer in this body butter due to me wanting it to be 100% natural. If the product arrives in any state that looks like it is melting my recommendation would be to put it in the refrigerator for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and that will get it back to a natural consistency. None of this affects the moisturizing properties of the body butter and you will still end up with an amazing product that is perfect for dry skin due to heat during these warm months

With most vintage vinyl there maybe a hiss and pop.  These album did not exhibit any audible skips.  Creedence Clearwater Revival, often shortened to Creedence and abbreviated as CCR, was an American rock band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford. Their musical style encompassed the roots rock, swamp rock,and blues rock genres. Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins, they portrayed a Southern rock style, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River, and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography, as well as political and socially-conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War. The band performed at 1969's famed Woodstock Festival.        ",11.00,4.99,"Vintage item from the 1970s

""Unmounted"" means that they are coming straight from my supplier.  They have not been opened by me, so I have not done anything to spread out their legs, wings, or other parts.  They are very fragile, so open these little individual packages with great care.
This package includes one female specimen of  Phyllium bioculatum, a leaf insect from Thailand.  The female is larger than the male, and more valueable.  They measure about 3.5 inches tall; quite large!    You can open up the wings if you desire, or frame them up exactly as is.

A yoga style gemstone beaded bracelet features Malachite, Pyrite, Aventurine, Tiger Eye and Citrine 6mm sphere gemstone beads with a smooth finish. Listing photo shows beads strung on fern nylon cord.
***Gemstones are believed to provide healing qualities when used for intent or during meditation. A gemstone cut into a sphere is the most recommended shape used in therapy practices. The shape of a sphere allows the gemstones energy to flow freely and evenly in all directions from within its center. The same applies to the energy and light a stone absorbs from the wearer. This back and forth energy flow is how a gemstone becomes in-tune with the wearer. The more vibrations that pass back and forth allow the stone to program a specific healing vibration according to your needs.***
Each bracelet measures approximately 9.0"" when fully open. Gemstone beads are strung on heavy weight nylon cording with a macrame adjustable closure. This bracelet slips over your hand, then the tag ends are pulled tight to wear the bracelet fitted around your wrist. If you need a size larger than 9.0 inches to slip over your hand, size please mention the size you would like at checkout. 
The cording is twisted for strength and will not stretch. It resists fraying and shredding. Nylon cord is perfectly safe to wear 24/7 and will last a long time.
This bracelet contains no metal materials, perfect for Reiki practitioners, healers and lightworkers.

This listing is made to order. Each gemstone bead is unique. The bracelet you receive may look slightly different to the one in the photographs. All natural gemstones have imperfections. These are not considered flaws, but add to the natural characteristics of each piece. Bead size may vary 1mm /-

***It is believed that charging your bracelet amplifies your intent***
CHARGING YOUR BRACELET
It is best to charge your crystal prior to wearing for intent. There are many practices you can follow to charge the bracelet. 
You can simply rinse the crystal in water, or you can follow up by placing the crystal in a clear glass filled with water. Place the glass on your windowsill, ideally facing the south, to charge in the sun. Some stones dont like to be submerged in water. To use a water cleanse with these crystals simply put the crystal in a GLASS cup. Then place the cup in ceramic or glass bowl.
The Moon is often used for cleansing and charging healing stones. Some people make a ritual of burying their crystal under a full moon, to take advantage of the magnetic forces of the moon in combination with the earth. You may also place your crystal in the direct light of the moon.
