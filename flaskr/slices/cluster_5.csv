            I am very fond of this horse. Maybe it’s just a sign of me getting older – but I’ve found myself thinking fondly of old toys. I’m talking about handcrafted wooden toys – the toys you play with when you visit your grandparents. My own grandpa had a workshop. He had a lathe and used it to make all kinds of stuff. He didn’t spend much time with us kids, but we knew him by the toys he made. This wonderful horse kinda reminds me of my grandpa and the toys he made!

137,"Antique Child's Sled, Antique Toddler Sled, Primitive Toy, Rustic Christmas Decor, Primitive Christmas Decor, c. 1870-1899, FREE SHIPPING","
            This is a handmade wood antique toddler sled. This antique child's sled would make a stunning addition to any rustic Christmas decor or primitive Christmas decor. Although you wouldn't use this primitive toy for its original purpose today, it would make an amazing Christmas centerpiece, plant stand, or display piece. It would look great on a porch or by a fireplace, among many other possibilities for winter decor. This rustic sled is believed to have come over from Europe in the late 1800s. The old chippy green paint on this 1800s toy appears to be original. This primitive sled is jointed together and has small metal supports, possibly hand-forged, which can be seen at the base of its two front legs. (I believe the supports are original because the old paint is covering them.) This antique toy measures approximately 22"" long x 11"" wide x 11"" high.
This is a vintage item with the natural wear, tear, and character flaws of age. It has many wonderful imperfections, such as a big crack in the back, uneven edges and planes, chippy paint, a visible white drop of paint, exposed metal supports (some with the green paint wearing off), scuffed edges, etc, but somehow all of it just seems to add to this wonderful antique toy's aged charm. Please see the photos for condition, as they are part of the description.
ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT INFO:
You will receive the exact sled shown in the photos above. (The teddy bear and poinsettia are not included.)
Please respect that prices are firm. Free Shipping is included to the United States & U.S. territories American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. 
For repeat customers, I am happy to reserve an item for up to 24 hours.
The items I sell are vintage and are being sold as collector's items rather than as usable items intended for their original purpose. These items are not new or pristine. They have the wear, tear, and flaws of age, and it's in that used, aged condition that you are buying them. I will point out any flaws that I notice, but please study the photos carefully as I consider them to be a big part of the item description. Also please ask questions, which I will be happy to answer to the best of my ability. Keep in mind that while I may sell vintage items and antiques, I am not an expert, so you need to rely on your own judgment when making a purchase.

======== FAQs ========
""Can you give me a quote for a large order?""

""Does the leather strap come with each tag?""
    - Yep! Each tag comes with the leather strap attached to the tag.
""Can you stamp anything on the back?""
    - Unfortunately, I cannot. The back side (flesh side) of the leather is rough and will leave and impression on the front if tooled on.
""Do you have any other colors available?""
   - I only have a single color stain (saddle tan) but can accommodate for larger orders.
""How soon will the order get to me?""
   - It depends if you're domestic (lower 48 states) or international. Allow 2-3 business days for shipping and 5-6 business days for international orders.

383,Chainmail Dice Bag - Small,"
            This chainmail dice bag is made out of 16g bright aluminum. It measures roughly 2 1/2"" wide and 3 1/2"" tall.  It can hold a lot of items such as change, dice, marbles, and much more.  It is 100% handmade from coiling the wire, saw cutting the rings, and then weaving them into a pouch.  The bag is fastened by a parachute cord and closed off by a cord lock.
Bright aluminum is very light weight, strong, and easy to care for.  To clean it all you have to use is soap, water, and a good drying off.  
Notes: 
The change/dice in the pictures are not included.
This bag can hold up to 3 1/2 standard sets of D&D dice (25 dice).  Any other combination may slightly alter the count.  For example: This bag can fit the 25 dice in 3 1/2 standard sets, but can only fit 18/19 D6's.
In stock and ships the next morning of purchase (excluding Sundays and holidays).

            Fabulous rhinestone chandelier earrings, dangling 3 1/2"" (87 mm) from the post, with 3/8"" resting on your ear lobe.  The sparkle is wonderful, with the dangling baguettes 80% sparkly.  There is one baguette on the right upper earring that looks dark in the pictures, but not to the naked eye, and is just as sparkly as the rest.  There is some darkening of the silver finish on the rear, and a gentle polishing would bring the color back.  The pictures don't do the earrings justice.  Great earrings for any dressy occasion.  Here are some other chandelier earrings:

            Hazel Atlas cups.   Dark green, maroon, rust and turquoise.    Some of the paint is worn on the bottoms and some on handles.    Turquoise has a rough/chip area on the inside rim.   2 1/8"" high and the cup, minus handle,  is 3 1/2"" in diameter.
Hazel Atlas, marking on bottom, sugar and creamer.  3 1/2"" high.  Rust color.  This color is from their Tempo color scheme.  Good condition except for a teeny nick on the sugar.   The creamer has a nick also.  
Hazel Atlas, marking on bottom, sugar and creamer in chartreuse, yellowish greenish color.  This color is from their Sierra Colors line.  They are in good condition.  A teeny-tiny nick on the sugar.  Both 3 1/2"" high.
Following is a little of what I found about these.
Hazel Atlas Glass	
Ovide (Platonite) Ovide was the official name Hazel Atlas assigned to their plain dinnerware line. Originally, the dinnerware was made in green transparent (depression glass). After the introduction of Platonite in the mid 1930s, Hazel Atlas produced a variety of color schemes using the Ovide blanks.
Some pieces in Ovide are found with advertising from ice cream parlors, businesses, dairies and an occasional restaurant. The ovide style was also used for all the spacemen, childrens, and Ranger Joe sets.        ",16.00,4.9894,"Vintage item

1918,Antique Pewter Spoons,"
            5 ANTIQUE, pewter spoons. The spoons are pre-1800's. They are made from  pewter, hand forged, and all are a little different. Three of the spoons have what looks like a Tudor rose stamp. Another has no marking and has a crack on the back of the handle, which doesn't diminish it's beauty.
They are all fairly big spoons, 7 inches long, with a bowl around 2 inches wide. They are about the size of a modern tablespoon, and made of fairly heavy pewter, for total weight of 12 ounces.
Great gift for the colonial collector. Wonderful display pieces.        ",100.00,5.0,"Vintage item

WHY VINTAGE BLING INSTEAD OF MODERN BLING?
Who doesn't like a bit of bling?  
The advantages of Vintage Bling over modern bling are: 
1) no-one else will be wearing it, 
2) it holds it's value, when you fancy a change you can sell it on and replace with a different 'new to you' piece, 
3) it is environmentally friendly because no new resources are being used to make, 
4) it's the opposite to throwaway fashion, no child is working in slave labour conditions to make something which'll fall apart or you wear once,
and finally, 5) the fact it is still in serviceable condition after 80 years means it was made to a quality that lasts.        ",9.95,4.9289,"Vintage item

            Fun and fabulous Enid Collins box bag.  This wonderful handbag was made in the 1960's by Collins of Texas, the company started by Enid Collins.  The ""Love"" line of wood box bags is highly collectible and is found in a few different designs.  The most popular are the ones that feature this pastel pink, green, yellow, and white decoration.  The color palette and ""love"" message were a big hit in the hippie influenced fashion scene of the late 1960's.  Some of the bags had leather handles, some had a hard plastic or a flexible vinyl handle. 
Measurements - 5 1/2"" tall  x  8 1/2""  x  4 1/4"".
Very good vintage condition.  A few minor scrapes and wear, interior very clean.  Vinyl handle and interior mirror in very good condition.  One missing flower embellishment.
Shipping costs can vary greatly depending on your location.  Please contact me prior to purchase and I will adjust the shipping cost according to your zip code.

4466,Vintage American Tourister Train Case - World Travel - Adventure - Vacation,"
            A classic American Tourister train case... in an pearlized, dusty-blue color.
It has the original removable mirror (with an easel back, so it can stand independently on a counter).  The attached elastic bands are in good condition (to hold your bottles of potions and lotions).
This item is in a gently used, vintage condition (without keys).
The outside dimensions are approximately 10 inches tall (excluding the handle), 14 inches long and 9 inches wide.
~~~  Feel free to ask any questions ~~ even the ""silly"" ones.
The cost of shipping will be the actual costs required by the United States Postal Service. As a default, the shipping cost shown is for Standard Post from Miami (the origin) to Seattle for a 6 pound, 'oversized' package. (If I allowed for Etsy's automated system to calculate, the cost will be for Priority Mail and much higher.)
--   If you have a delivery zip code which is closer, please let me know and I will recalculate.
Many additional items from my shop can be purchased and placed *inside* the train case to combine shipping fees.
☆ If you purchase multiple listings from my shop, and the shipping fees can be combined... 
**many items can fit inside**
...I will do so, and provide a partial refund when there is an excess of 1 or more.        ",22.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1970s

5119,Enesco Clown Music Box Dancer Musical Figurine Vintage,"
            Here is an adorable Enesco hobo clown music box. This balloon-holding clown is very colorful, and he is not scary in the least. 
He is dressed in green pants with yellow suspenders, a light blue shirt, and a green hat. He is holding a bunch of balloons in one hand, and his other hand is tucked in his pocket. There's a daisy like flower on his suspenders, and also tucked into a band on his hat. He has the usual orange clown hair, red nose, and big red grin. He is standing on a red drum-like base.
This brightly colored clown music box has an Enesco sticker on the bottom, and it also says ""Music Box Dancer"" on the label, which I guess is the tune this piece plays (it's not a tune I am familiar with). The wind-up key is on the bottom, and it plays fine.
Overall height is approx. 9"", with a base diameter of approx. 3-3/4"". 
He is in very good condition, with no chips, cracks, or crazing noted.

    Sun Yat Sen ; 12 November 1866 – 12 March 1925) was a Chinese revolutionary, first president and founding father of the Republic of China, and medical practitioner. As the foremost pioneer of the Republic of China, Sun is referred to as the ""Father of the Nation"" in the Republic of China (ROC), and the ""forerunner of democratic revolution"" in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Sun played an instrumental role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty during the years leading up to the Double Ten Revolution. He was appointed to serve as Provisional President of the Republic of China when it was founded in 1912. He later co-founded the Kuomintang (KMT), serving as its first leader.[3] Sun was a uniting figure in post-Imperial China, and he remains unique among 20th-century Chinese politicians for being widely revered amongst the people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
     Sun's chief legacy resides in his developing of the political philosophy known as the Three Principles of the People: nationalism (non-ethnic, independence from imperialist domination), democracy (up to Western standards), and the people's livelihood by instituting free trade and Georgist tax reform        ",23.99,4.8356,"Vintage item from the 1940s

5330,"REMNANT of Vintage Wallpaper, Single 26 Inch Piece - Segmant of Kitchen Wallpaper with Red and Black Dining Table on Gray, Cast Iron Stove","
            This single piece of vintage wallpaper comes from the ""Hannah's Treasures Remnant Collection."" It is an authentic piece of vintage wallpaper printed in the 1950s; it is not a reproduction.
Papers from our ""Remnant Collection"" are measured individually and sold by the entire piece. Length and price vary per remnant. 
  This specific piece is 18 inches wide and 26 inches long.<<
The papers available in our Remnants and Rolls shop represent our 25 years of collecting vintage wallpaper and showcase the wide variety of patterns that we've encountered throughout Hannah's Treasures' history. Most of these papers were found many years back in travels decades ago, while some have come and gone from our collection more recently. 
Each remnant piece is all that remains of that paper in our collection. This is the last of this paper; there are no more yards or rolls to be purchased from our store. 
These pieces are in good vintage condition, but will be shipped ""as is"" (that is to say ""without trimming"") in order to preserve as much of the paper as possible. You may find some small tears or blemishes around the edges of the paper, but overall the condition is very good. Please keep in mind that these papers are between 40 and 100 years old so you can expect some generally signs of aging.
These papers were made available with the vintage wallpaper lover & collector in mind. 
For wallpapers sold by the yard, please visit our other two Etsy stores, Hannah's Treasures for wallpaper from the 30s, 40s, and 50s (www.hannahstreasures.etsy.com) and Retro Wallpaper for papers from the 60s and 70s including vinyls, flocks, and more (www.retrowallpaper.etsy.com).
If you have any questions, please ask. 
Remember to review “Shipping & Policies” before purchase.

These butterfly wings are made from semi-clear orgainza fabric: soft, thin and very light weight. They are very thin and color fast. You could use one piece, or two, or three pieces to make a beautiful dreamy butterfly. Since these ""wings"" come as flat piece so you might need to add a ""body"" - adding a few pieces of delicate rhinestones would be a beautiful idea. Rhinestone chains are available in our store.
This listing is for 8 pieces【5cm】organza butterflies, one style in one pack. Please order style number according to the Style Chart.

8811,Leather Hair Tie. Hair Accessories Elastic for hair and Wrist. Hair Elastic. Hair Ties. Leather hair Accessories.,"
            *The ORIGINAL leather hair tie* Exceptionally handmade in Brooklyn NY
Upgrade that elastic you keep on your wrist for pulling your hair back. Bonus - this one looks like a leather bracelet on your wrist, not a ratty old elastic. How versatile of you! A non-'scrunchie' hair tie, the leather lies smooth around your pony tail & wrist.
DETAILS:
Leather
Elastic
Raw edges
Stitched closed
*this listing is for ONE hair tie, please choose color in dropdown menu*
ABOUT THESE LEATHERS:
All are extremely soft, supple real hide leathers.
Golden: Very lightweight, supple, soft neutral colored pigskin leather base (very similar to lambskin),
with metallic gold foil printed in animal skin pattern. Pigskin is very lightweight.
Powder pink: Extremely soft lambskin (lambskin is very lightweight). Light pink in color with a subtle pearl finish.
QUESTIONS:
Q: ""Can the elastic band circle a couple of times around hair for varying styles/hair thicknesses, or just once? Do you have different sized elastic bands?""
A: Yes, the elastic can go around twice, or three times even if you have thin hair. The elastic part is just like a regular hair elastic you would buy at the drugstore. We do not offer the elastics in different sizes. 
HOW ITS MADE:
The leather is hand cut, then individually assembled and stitched on an industrial sewing machine in NYC. These pieces are made one at a time with great care. 
All materials purchased from USA vendors.

• A descriptive card about the scent and a list of the prominent notes and accords is included for each perfume.
About Natural Perfume:
If you have used synthetically fragranced products (fragrance oils), you have probably noticed how they are missing the depth and the true scent that real plants, fruits, and flowers have. 
Natural perfumes are much different to wear than what you will find at a headache-inducing commercial perfume counter; these essences meld with your body chemistry and stay close to the skin. Only you and those you embrace will be aware that you are wearing it. These blends of botanical distillations are more satisfying to the senses and have subtle healing properties (aromatherapy) that your mind and body will love.
Combined in a base of organic jojoba and coconut oil, these perfumes nourish the skin instead of damaging it as alcohol-based perfumes do. They also do not contain chemicals to make them last all day. Instead, they wear off in the course of about 4-6 hours, and can be re-applied as a sensory ritual. This allows the opportunity to reflect and appreciate the moment, connect with nature through its true essences, and experience the perfume’s evolution in intervals each day.

the P E R F U M E S...
Ambra - Unisex. Fossilized amber with its earthy, woodsy note, my own blended amber, with cistus, vetiver, and forest notes. My original Amber themed perfume.
An Island for Paula - tropical fruit notes amongst soft notes of Mimosa and Lotus. A sweet tropical experience.
Belles - A big splash of citrus in a delicious blend of Vanilla, Turkish Rose, Faint Jasmine, wildflowers and a dash of saffron.
Dreaming Forest - Notes of  Moss, Canadian Fir, Balsam, Spruce, tree sap, and fossilized amber resin. I describe this one as the scent of  trees with a dash of smoke from the fireplace which is filled with crackling pinecones  and fir logs.
Driftwood - Dry parched woods with smooth dark, earthy notes.
Emiko - This perfume oil is a botanical inspiration. If you are a sci fi fan you will recognize the name perhaps, if not, the name Emiko comes from the original Godzilla story and the perfume itself is certainly inspired. Emiko contains delicious notes of mandarin and blood orange up front with coconut and dreamy apricot, along with subtle Japanese rose and a hint of creamy Gardenia on a base of vanilla bourbon which gives the perfume a lovely finish that isn't too sweet.
Eartha - Opens in a field of mushrooms then blends beautifully into creamy rich patchouli and sandalwood with hints of tuberose. Inspired by a story I am writing and also included in the Fragments of Darkness series of perfumes.
Loom of Smoke - Walk into the woods and breathe in the scented damp fog, dense fragrant moss, and towering woods. The other notes include tree bark, fir and pine veiled in faintest smoke, a hint of wild lavender, black currant, incense, fossilized amber, in pure grain alc tincture of 3000 yr old cedar bark.
Miss Mary Jane - inspired by a female botanist. Notes of champa flower, faint plumeria, lightest peach note with incense, faintly smokey, sandalwood base. From the Lady Botanists series.
Tobacco Rose - Vintage Rose and dry, sweet tobacco marry beautifully with soft saffron and creamy woods. 
Nine Days in July - Fresh air atop a bouquet of lotus and champa flower with a smooth sandalwood finish.
Poete Fleur - Seriously dirt-soil and daffodil. Very green and complimented with tonka bean.
Rosa d'orleans - This perfume's main note is French Rose married with amber and accented with notes of cardamom, black pepper, rock rose, siam wood blend, vetiver, and roots of iris. What French inspired perfume wouldn't have a dash of powder? just a dash....
Rosewood and Vetiver - Opens with the scent of wild berries on a bed of vetiver and rosewood
The Rose Bee - My personal fave right now with notes of honeycomb, beeswax, clover, and rose. A very honeycomb rose scent with notes of hay and clover added. Helps support pollinators!
Welcome to Siberia - the icy cold fir and pine forests of  trees.
.
Zelle Opium - Very spicy perfume, think opium dens of long ago with cinnamon, pepper, carnation, ylang,on a vetiver base. Very spicy.
The container will not be full but will hold about 1-2 grams solid perfume balm, enough for several tries. You will also receive a random perfume sample which could be liquid or solid.

All my perfumes and colognes are 100% natural. They are not like commercial perfumes as they only contain natural life such as plant for all my botanical perfumes and from the animal kingdom,  essences from nature like honey, beeswax or seashell as found in the Rose Bee and Oistre Fe.   You will notice right away that naturals are more subtle, not as loud and get you in touch with nature immediately and may even bring up fond memories. Likely you will need to apply naturals more often than synthetics  but that's a good thing as your body knows nature at its core and may even crave it.

9051,Organic 100% Grass-fed Tallow Balm,"
            Seasonal note: We are headed into the warm summer months! If your tallow balm appears melted upon arrival, just pop it into the refrigerator for a few hours, and it will solidify. Enjoy your summer! 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add gift wrapping to any order! Just find gift wrapping listed as a separate product in my shop, and add it to your purchase.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experience the deep nourishing properties of grass-fed tallow in this pure tallow balm. Essential in skin care, this balm moisturizes, heals, and protects skin like nothing else. Perfect as an anti-aging face cream, for healing and soothing dry or itchy skin, eczema, diaper rash, wind and sunburn, and for fading scars and stretch marks. 
My organic, 100% grass-fed tallow comes from cattle raised locally on pasture here in Loveland, Colorado. No antibiotics, hormones, or pesticides are used. Cattle eat only rotationally grazed grass, and are never fed any grain. I store my tallow in glass only. 
I use exclusively Plant Therapy® brand essential oils in my products. They are some of the highest quality essential oils available, and you can read about their purity, policies and practices at https://www.planttherapy.com/essential-oil-quality 
Ingredients:
100% Grass-fed beef tallow†, extra virgin olive oil*, therapeutic grade essential oils
*certified organic
†not certified organic, but raised according to and even beyond organic certification standards
Available as an amber glass jar.
Note: 100% grass-fed tallow has a softer consistency than tallow from cattle fed grain. This is a sign of the higher nutrient content, and evidence that the cattle were indeed fed and finished on only grass. You can expect 100% grass-fed tallow to be about the same consistency at room temperature as grass-fed butter: softer at warmer temperatures, and firmer at cooler temperatures. If you prefer a firmer product, but still want the nutrients and benefits of 100% grass-fed, consider storing it in a cool place.
Scent options: 
Lavender - Let the stresses of the day drift away with this relaxing scent. Also has skin healing and soothing properties. Uses Lavender essential oil. Safe for kids.
Wildflower Meadow - Wildflower Meadow - A bright, refreshing, floral scent that is designed to energize and elevate the mind. Also helps to soothe and heal skin. Uses Mandarin, Lemon, Lavender, Palmarosa, and Ho Wood essential oils. Safe for kids.
Eczema Soothe - Soothe and give relief to eczema, or any skin irritation. This blend is formulated to soften skin and reduce roughness and redness. Uses Lavender, Copaiba, Palmarosa, Lemon, Frankincense carteri, and Helichrysum italicum essential oils. Safe for kids.
Skin Repair - Smooth the appearance of scars and stretch marks, and speed healing with this blend. Uses Lavender and Neroli essential oils. Safe for kids.
Ageless -  The perfect blend to help replenish dry skin, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and improve the look of mature skin. Also great for healing blemishes. Uses Lavender, Frankincense Serrata, Lemon, Petitgrain, Coriander, Turmeric, and Rose Absolute essential oils.
Forest Spice - A more masculine scent, this blend conveys the fragrance of a walk in the woods combined with a subtle hint of spice. 
 
Unscented - Perfect for those who prefer a product without essential oils. Safe for kids, and is also the best choice for use on babies under two.

9077,Organic Eczema Cream | Healing Salve for Baby & Adults | Baby Shower Gift  - Natural Eczema Relief | Dry Skin Lotion | Psoriasis Cream,"
            Organic Eczema Cream that's safe for baby, children and adults. A great natural alternative to prescriptions/steroid creams for eczema, psoriasis and extremely dry skin. Upon initial use it provides immediate relief from itching. Creamy and smooth, it melts into skin without greasy residue.  It begins to clear active skin disruptions within 1 week of daily use (though most people report initial stages of clearing within 3-5 days). 
Many customers- myself included- have found this product to be *far* superior to Rx creams at providing relief  healing from itchiness and painful, tender skin associated with eczema and related conditions. Non-GMO and preservative free.
----
Organic shea butter and coconut oil combines with organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil, evening primrose oil, chamomile, house-infused calendula oil, and a few soothing, medicinal grade healing essential oils such as calendula that bring immediate relief from eczema 
----
Ingredient Highlights
Evening primrose oil helps with eczema and psoriasis, as it contains gamma-linolenic acid, a rare fatty acid which nourishes the skin and it's thought to correct deficiencies in skin lipids, thus reducing inflammation.
Calendula is our go-to staple for almost any skin condition! It has amazing skin healing properties, while also reducing pain and inflammation associated with skin and autoimmune disorders.
German Chamomile is a popular natural treatment for eczema and psoriasis, as it soothes itchiness and calm inflammation. 
Organic cold pressed virgin coconut oil is a highly effective moisturizer which many eczema and psoriasis suffers claim to be far more effective than store bought creams. 
Raw African shea butter is one of nature's finest healers. High in vitamins A, E, and F, which help many skin conditions including eczema, psoriasis, cracked skin, inflamed skin and autoimmune conditions. It also acts as a barrier against the elements- be it cold or heat. Both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory.

Apply as often as needed to the affected area to immediately calm inflammation, soothe and repair the skin. With daily use active eczema sites should begin to diminish within a week. Safe for infants, toddlers, children and adults.

What our Customers are Saying:
""I have had eczema on my hands for over ten years now and this is by far the best thing I have EVER came across! I use it almost daily. It heals my eczema just as good as the harsh steroid creams that I've used for years, without all of the harmful effects! I'm so glad I found this shop! Try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed! This stuff rocks!""
-Amanda M.
""Love this product! Has already helped my eczema from winter dryness and frequent washing of hands before and after about 15 patients per day. Thank you!""
-Dr. Lauren C. 
""I can't recommend this eczema cream enough! I had a patch of dry itchy skin on my arm for over a month.... I used this cream for TWO days and it is totally gone! I love that it is almost like a salve, it absorbs quickly and really works!""
-Erin M. 
""I've lived with eczema my whole life. Here recently it's been so bad I've spent so much money on trying to find something that actually works. I was on etsy doing my usual look-around and I decided to see if I could find something for eczema... I came across this site and was of course skeptical at first but let me tell you how AMAZING this product is. I received my herbal eczema cream on a Wednesday and by Thursday night/Friday morning my eczema is barely noticeable. And that's saying a lot coming from what my skin looked like before. My package arrived in the time specified, had NO issues and she even threw in a small brown sugar lip scrub (which I also love)!! I never leave review but I felt I needed to tell the girl or guy reading this review thinking ""I wonder if this actually works?"" that it does.... Worth every penny. ❤️""
-Arian C. 
""This is amazing stuff, thank you so much!!! My son was on steroid cream from the doctor over the past 2 weeks and it didn't take away the eczema completely. Within 3 days of using this cream my son's skin is almost clear. I am so happy I found this cream. Thank you so much!!!!!""
-Caiden 
""I was just diagnosed with eczema and was prescribed a chemical cream. However, I had a lot of concerns about using it long term and I'm not a chemical kind of person, but I still wanted something that would work well. Then I found this and took a chance and I'm glad I did because this cream is perfect in every way. I love the smell and the texture is great plus it's organic! If I put it on in the morning it hydrates all day no worries and no itch. And unlike the one I received from my doctor, it doesn't rub onto my clothing. I highly suggest this cream if you're someone who wants a natural solution to eczema.""
-Alex J. 
""This stuff is amazing! I have contact dermatitis and have tried tons of homeopathic creams and balms. After one application I could tell this was different. The scaly skin diminished by at least 75%. I will definitely buy more when this runs out.""
-Michele R. 
""My daughter has moderate eczema. She likes this cream a lot. It doesn't sting when she applies it to her active eczema sites, which is unusual. She applied it to an active eczema sore and it cleared up in two days. Even the prescription creams don't work that well. I will buy this again.""

            Glow in the Dark Blue! In normal light the color appears to be a very light translucent blue, but when the lights go out, it glows bright!! Awesome and cool way to relax and relieve stress right before you go to sleep!

This spinner is the perfect gadget for fidgeters and people with lots of energy. Just the simple motion of playing with it helps you focus and concentrate during work, at school, or just at home. Try it once and you'll be addicted!!

Regardless of whether you buy these for someone or treat yourself you will know that great memories will be created while playing a few rounds of bags!

These are regulation size boards measuring 4'x2'. They are made of high quality plywood and poplar. These boards are too beautiful to paint over which is why we only offer stain.        ",140.00,4.9624,"Handmade item

            🎊 This tutu is made with Red, Orange, Yellow, Emerald Green, Royal Blue and Purple Tulle. 🎊
Do you have a school function you would like to dress up for or even a fun run 5k like the Zombie Run, Turkey Trot or a Color Run?! Then this tutu is for you!! This Tutu is perfect for many occasions including holidays, dance classes, photo props, dress up, birthday parties and so much more!
The tutu is made with 3 layers of soft tulle and is hand tied onto a premade crochet band which is very stretchy. 
👀 The tutu may appear small first out of the package but the waistband is super stretchy and will stretch to the max measurement stated in the listing under the sizes. I always double and triple check my measurements so Please try it on first. Thank you! 
💥TUTU SIZES/LENGTHS:
Newborn - 12 months: The Tutu will measure 6"" long
12 months - 24 months: The Tutu will measure 7"" long
2T - 5T: The Tutu will measure 8"" long or 9"" long (2 choices)
 
📢📢PLEASE NOTE: Please measure around your HIPS as well as your WAIST and go by the biggest measurement when choosing which size you need. 
🚨EXAMPLE: if your waist is 28 inches but your hips are 35 inches, you will need to get a size that fits over the 35 inches. These tutus are pull on so they need to fit over the hips to get to your waist. If you do not have a measuring tape you can use a piece of string and measure that against a standard ruler. 
🎉🎊ALL SIZES LISTED BELOW ARE A STANDARD 9 INCHES LONG. 🎉🎊
 
GIRLS: Waist/Hip size 21 - 27"" (max stretch) will be 9"" in length (athletic length)
ADULT SMALL: Waist/Hip size 27 - 32"" (max stretch) will be 9"" in length (athletic length)
ADULT MEDIUM: Waist/Hip size 32 - 36"" (max stretch) will be 9"" in length (athletic length) 
ADULT LARGE: Waist/Hip size 36 - 40"" (max stretch) will be 9"" in length (athletic length)
ADULT XLARGE: Waist/Hip size 40 - 44"" (max stretch) will be 9"" in length (athletic length)
ADULT 2XLARGE: Waist/Hip size 44 - 48"" (max stretch) will be 9"" in length (athletic length)
🚨 PLEASE measure your HIPS too! 🚨
📢📢Please note that this is a general size guide that I use, they are not based on US pant sizes. 
❎EXAMPLE: If you can not get your size 30/31 waist pants on (all the way up from feet to waist) without unbuttoning and unzipping them first then a SMALL: 27 - 32"" Max will NOT fit. 🚨Please double check your WAIST and HIP measurements before placing your order. For a custom fit please put both your hip and waist measurements in the notes to seller box. Thank you!  
Would you like just a little bit more coverage? I will be happy to make your tutu 10"" long by simply adding this ""Make my tutu 10"" please"" listing to you order by clicking the link below.
https://www.etsy.com/listing/280039602/make-my-tutu-10-please
Would you prefer your Tutu even longer?! I would be happy to make your tutu 12"" long by adding the ""Make my tutu 12"" listing by clicking the link below.
https://www.etsy.com/listing/253988126/make-my-tutu-12
🌟Also please note that the shorter the tutu the puffier it will appear. If you prefer your tutu to be shorter so it will appear fuller please put it in the notes to seller. The longer the tulle the less ""sticky outy"" or ""puffy"" it will be. The longer the tulle is the heavier it is. 
📢 The tutu shown in the listing picture is a size 12-24 month at 7"" long. 
🎉All my tutus are made with 3 layers of tulle. If you would like to have your tutu even Fuller you can add an Extra Layer by clicking the link below.
https://www.etsy.com/listing/254030794/add-an-extra-layer-make-my-tutu-fuller
🌟ALSO NOTE that these tutus are NOT intended to be worn as stand alone skirts, wearing shorts or pants underneath IS RECOMMENDED! They are made to be shorter for Athletic Purposes. 🏅Any size bigger than an infant or toddler size is 9 INCHES in length unless an add on for a longer tutu has been added. I feel that 9"" is the perfect length for running tutus as they won't tangle in your legs or impede your pace, you wont even know its there.🏃‍♀️The 9 INCH length will not fully cover your bottom, if you need more length please add an add-on with the additional length. 
🌟NOTE that the color of the crochet band may vary from the picture due to what is in stock, but it will always match.
💡Colors may vary slightly due to computer monitors set differently and I also use studio lighting. 
⏰My current production time is 5-7 business days. If you need your tutu made and shipped sooner than my 5-7 business day timeline please add the link below and I will move your order to the top of my to-do list.

10508,Handmade Intermediate Oboe Reed,"
            One handmade intermediate level reed is shaped on a nagamtsu shaper tip, from an Innoledy gouge.  The reed tied on a 47mm MSA oboe staple and measures a total of 70-71mm.  This reed is great for advanced middle school students to intermediate high school students.  The reed is easy to play but still has a warm and rich sound.  All reeds I personally play-check for intonation, response, and excellent tone.
My first priority in reed making is to make the reed responsive and easy to play on, even in my professional level reeds.  Secondly I ensure that each reed consistently plays in tune at 440.  I am very careful to check the octaves in the upper register so the reed does not require pinching or biting to play in tune.  Once these two elements are present, a beautiful, warm, full sound always emerges.  
My reeds are superior because I am a band director. I have seen what works and what doesn't with beginning oboe students and advanced students. Before I began teaching in a school district, I only sold my reeds to my oboe students. Then I was able to fix a reed whenever a student was struggling with it. But now that I am directing a band program of over 250 students, I don't have time to adjust reeds every time I see my student. I have a very accurate picture of a student needs from their reed.  I ensure that it is complete and ready to play!
Here is a guide to help you select your reed type and strength
Beginner Medium/Soft Reed--These reeds are for beginners who are just learning to play or have only been playing a few months.  They are very easy to play but will not provide the mature tone that the intermediate or professional reeds will supply.  
www.etsy.com/listing/170185242/handmade-beginner-oboe-reed
Intermediate Medium Reed--If you are unsure of which reed to order, this is a great place to start.  These reeds will play ""broken in"" after very little use.  They are easy to play but still provide a mature sound and are a great follow up to the Beginning Medium/Soft reeds.  These reeds are great for any level, but are best for students who have been playing for 6 months- 3 or 4 years.  These reeds are completely finished and will not have much room for alterations.  
https://www.etsy.com/listing/170186238/handmade-intermediate-oboe-reed
Intermediate Medium/Hard Reed--These reeds are less responsive than the Intermediate Medium Reeds.  They have darker tone and have more room for you to tailor your reed to your playing style.  They have a thicker tip and will take more time to break them in. Students who order these reeds are advanced middle school students or freshmen or sophomores in High school. 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/170186238/handmade-intermediate-oboe-reed
Professional Medium Reed--The professional reeds have a nicer staple that really open the reeds up and sing beautifully.  The Medium reeds are the reeds that I would most likely play on myself and will play already ""broken in"".  
https://www.etsy.com/listing/170186400/handmade-professional-oboe-reed
Professional Medium/Hard Reed-- The professional reeds have a nicer staple that really open the reeds up and sing beautifully.  They have darker tone and have more room for you to tailor your reed to your playing style.  They have a thicker tip and will take more time to break them in. 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/170186400/handmade-professional-oboe-reed
Professional Hard Reed-- The professional reeds have a nicer staple that really open the reeds up and sing beautifully.  These reeds would be great for an oboist who feels that a Medium/Hard reed just isn't hard enough!!  They will have lots of room for adjustment and will be less responsive than the Medium/Hard reeds.  Buyer beware...these are hard!

10659,Vintage Children's Record-Sing the Hit Songs of Sesame Street-Jim Henson-The Muppets-Cookie Monster-Kermit-Big Bird,"
            ""Sing the Hit Songs of Sesame Street"".  A 1974 CTW compilation record featuring the gang performing the greatest hits from the first five years of the show.  Included are ""Sesame Street Theme"", ""Sing"", Bein' Green"", ""I Love Trash"" and ""C is for Cookie"".  A full play list of all twelve songs can be seen in the 4th photo.
Both the cover and the vinyl are in near mint - NM - condition.
A lovely addition to a child's record collection.  Will arrive with new inner and outer sleeves.  (I love children's records - they evoke old memories and help to create new ones - and only list those that can be played and enjoyed.  You can find more here:

Shipping costs are estimated as best as possible given the diversity of locations and if my estimate is over by more than 2.00, I will automatically refund the excess. (Please note that the default Canadian shipping is based on delivery from Hamilton, ON to Vancouver, BC but should you live closer to me the cost would most likely be less. For example, to Toronto would be 7).
Sample Estimated Delivery Times
to Vancouver 5 to 7 business days, no tracking or insurance
to Toronto 2 to 3 business days, no tracking or insurance
to US 5 to 8 business days, no tracking or insurance
to Australia 4 to 8 weeks, surface, no tracking or insurance
to the UK 4 to 6 weeks, surface, no tracking or insurance
Faster, more expensive shipping options - including tracking and insurance - are available.
I'm more than happy to combine shipping but it's best to convo me so that I can fine tune the shipping based on your location and avoid any overage from the outset.
I happily ship internationally - if not listed, convo me with your location and I'll provide a quote.
Thanks for looking!

10941,Death Note Ryuk's Earring (Made to Order),"
            *Made to Order items are not kept in inventory and are created after purchase. Please note that turnaround times for made-to-order items can range from 1-2 weeks.
This listing is for ONE Ryuk's earring, featuring a polymer clay heart suspended on gunmetal chain. Please view the 5th photograph and read below for customization options! 
♣ DIMENSIONS:
• Charm only: ~3/4""(H) x 3/4""(W) - request a custom size if you like! 
• Entire length: ~2-3/4"" (including chain) 
Clay pieces have been treated with a gloss(shiny) finish. Charms are not waterproof! Please do not wear them in the shower, while swimming, etc. 
Cosplay photo courtesy of Gabrielle Benyak! The earring featured in this photo is with a clip-on and 2"" Chain C!
gbenyak.wix.com/glassheartfx
-------------------------------------------------------------------
♣ ♣ ♣  CUSTOMIZATION ♣ ♣ ♣ 
Earring (default, no customization) base price: 15.00 USD 
The default earring comes with 2 inches of Chain A and a gunmetal earring hook (C). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
♣ CHAIN: 
Please look at the 5th photo in this listing for options! Default chain is 2 inches of chain (A). 
Default chain length is 2 inches. If you'd like a custom length, please send me a note so I can make you a custom order! Additional chain length will cost extra, based on length! 
(I am sorry for all of the chain options... I went a little crazy buying inventory last month ~_~) But they all look really nice together, it just depends on what you're looking for! 8D 
*NOTE: Heavier vs. Lighter Chains
I have a wide assortment of chains available. The heavier chains (A - C) are made of iron and tend to be sturdier but are also heavier, which will result in a heavier earring overall. If you have sensitive earlobes, going with a lighter chain is recommended to reduce strain. 
The lighter chains (D - F) are made of aluminum. They are lighter, but also weaker. Excessive force on these chains might cause some of the links to bend out of shape or break.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
♣ EARRING FINDING: 
Please look at the 4th photo in this listing for options! Default earring finding is the gunmetal hook (G3).
Choose between gunmetal or sterling silver options. Hypoallergenic findings are also available upon request, though these will be bright silver (not gunmetal) and will not match the color of the rest of the earring. 
Prices vary for oxidized sterling silver pieces, listed below: 
• GUNMETAL (usually silver-plated brass and nickel-free)
*labeled with code ""G#"" in 4th photo
- clip-on (G1): included in price
- post (G2): included in price
- hook (G3): included in price ***(default if custom earring finding is not chosen)
- leverback (G4): included in price
- 1/4 inch ear cuff (G5): 2.00
- 3/8 inch ear cuff (G6): 2.50
- hypoallergenic hook: 
stainless/surgical steel hook, looks like G3
will not be gunmetal-colored (might be a brighter silver tone than the rest of the earring)
• .925 STERLING SILVER
*labeled with code ""S#"" in 4th photo
- post (S1): 4.00
- 10mm hoop (S2): 4.00
- hook (S3): 2.00
- leverback (S4): 3.00 
♣ ♣ ♣ WARNING ♣ ♣ ♣

• Please keep away from young children - harmful if swallowed.
• It is recommended to clean all earrings with rubbing alcohol prior to use.

• I try to make my charms as sturdy as possible, but in general handmade objects are going to be more fragile than mass-produced products. Please be gentle 8D

We add to our color library daily and we probably have it!

PLEASE NOTE
The process of engraving a wood cutting board includes the use of a high density laser. The laser beam burns the wood, producing the desired design. Because each board’s wood is different (i.e.,the grain, texture, and consistency), the coloration of the engraving and grain pattern of the wood may be slightly different than the picture shown. 
We use a food grade mineral oil which seasons the wood, sealing out moisture and brings out the natural color and grain pattern of the wood. No wood stains are used.        ",25.00,4.9484,"Handmade item

Black Skinny Tie. Taylor Lautner, Justin Timberlake, Robert Pattinson, and many other celebs are wearing the ""Skinny Tie""  Now your boys can too! 
 According to GQ magazine-skinny ties are back! A true skinny tie is no wider than 2 inches, but that's for the average adult man- so I came up with my own pattern for boys. The narrow tie is no wider than 1.5 inches and has 2 long tails.The neck has extra length so he can wear it tight or loosely. Pairs wonderfully with a T-shirt (80's style) or with a collared shirt.  If you prefer the standard tie width-please let me know in ""notes to seller"" at check-out.
Don't know how to tie a necktie? No Problem! The pre-tied tie and soft, Velcro closure ensure easy on and off for guys with the wiggles! Don't worry mom, this is washable. 100% cotton. Wash, lay flat to dry, and iron for a crisp look. The body of these ties are hand stitched for the perfect shape.
*Lining (back of the tie) may vary from picture).

14793,Beginner's Weaving Kit with Loom for Wall Hanging and Tapestry,"
            I am so super excited to be able to offer something to all of your who have been following my work but unable to attend my classes. 
What's included in the kit:
1 x Hand made, sustainable loom 12""x16"" 
1 x instructional booklet 
1 x  calico bag
1 x yarn needle
1 x weaving scissors 
Warping thread 
Enough yarn to complete your first weave (see below for color choices)
Some hand spun or unspun yarn to experiment with.
Let me know which color way you would like /
1. Pastel colors (peach, mint, seafoam, etc)
2. Neutrals (black grey beige white  brown etc)
3. Lights (white, beige, off white) 
*Please note: as yarn is either vintage or hand spun and dyed, colours may differ slightly from photos. 
The kit is really skewed towards self-learners and does not give you the same experience as doing one of my intensive classes.  It does come with the instructions I use as my class diagram handouts.  It's a good start and you can search the web once you have some of the correct terminologies.
**OUR RETURN POLICY** We offer full refunds within 1 WEEK from your purchase date. After the first week we only offer store credit.**        ",140.00,4.8543,"Handmade Supply

15568,Metal Stamp Symmetrical Branch Border (DS433),"
            Symmetrical Branch Border Metal Design Stamp - Beaducation Original
-Design measures: 11.5mm wide by 3.5mm high.
-Made from 1/2"" square heat-treated tool steel.
-Arrive coated in oil to prevent rusting. 
-Wipe oil away with paper towel. Do not use water. 
-Use on typical jewelry metals, not on hard metals like Stainless Steel.
Lisa's Notes:
Design Stamps are a bit tricky. I highly recommend you practice on some cheaper metal before diving into your Sterling Silver or Gold Filled. You can also watch my FREE video tutorial, Stamping on Metal at www.beaducation.com/online_classes/20
For best results with Design Stamps, make sure there is NO padding under your Bench Block, make sure you are working on a stable table, and use a utility hammer (nail pounding hammer) which weighs at least 16 ounces. Feel free to hit the stamp more than once, but hold that stamp steady, making sure you don't shift at all between hits. The more confident you are with the hammer and the strength behind it, the better your impression will be.        ",16.00,4.9689,"Craft type: Beading, Jewelry making, Metalworking, Paper stamping

15948,She Believed She Could So She Did Stainless Steel Charm - Laser Engraved - Round - Quantity Options - F4L4,"
            You will receive these ""She Believed She Could So She Did"" made to order LASER engraved stainless steel charms.
Measurements are 1"" x 3/4"" or 25mm x 20mm (vertical x horizontal).
Perfect for charm bracelets, pendants, necklaces, earrings, piercings, key chains, zipper pulls, bookmarks, or anything else you can think of!
The charms are created with a high quality, hand polished stainless steel that is hypoallergenic and won't tarnish. 
We have our own fiber laser engraver that we operate right here in New Mexico!
To watch our laser engraver in action, check out our video:
youtube.com/watch?v=RocGxQIOXS4
Our laser burns deep into the charm, which brings out the dark bold tones of the metal. The end result looks very professional and will not fade since we don't use any aerosol paints or chemicals in our lasering process (the fiber laser is very powerful).
With regular ""etching"" or engraving with an etcher, it only scratches the surface of the metal and leaves a white hard-to-read finish. Since we use a lasering process, the design will be easy to read and clearly legible in any light.
Check out our Instagram for videos of our lasering process! (Link is at bottom of description)
Choose your quantity from the drop-down box (the more you buy, the more you save!)

We ship SAME DAY or NEXT DAY from Rio Rancho, New Mexico (which is close to Albuquerque)!
Shipping costs are accurate, we do NOT profit on shipping, and we do NOT charge extra shipping for multiple orders of any design!

16070,She Believed Stainless Steel Charm - She Believed She Could... So She Did - Exclusive Line - Quantity Options  - BFS654,"
            Stainless steel charms with ""She Believed She Could So She Did"" laser engraved... from our exclusive line, specially designed for Bohemian Findings.
The charms are made from high-quality stainless steel hand polished on both sides. Stainless steel is hypoallergenic and won't tarnish. The lettering will not fade, as we don’t use any aerosol paints or chemicals in our lasering process.
We LASER, not ENGRAVE your phrase directly onto the charm. Etching or engraving only scratches the charm surface and produces a white, hard to read script. Our Laser method actually cuts deeply into the charm and brings out the dark tones of the metal. Your phrase will be clearly legible in any light... easy to read... fabulous quality! We do all the lasering right here in rural PEI!
Perfect for pendants, earrings, zipper pulls, bookmarks and key chains!
Measurements: 3/4"" x 7/8"" or 19mm x 22mm
Choose your quantity from the drop down box... quantity savings!
Need more? Just drop me a convo!
Important Notice: Although we will make every effort to ship your order within 1-2 working days, any orders including a number of laser charms may take 3-4 business days to produce, as they are custom made to order. Please convo us if you have any questions! Thank you so much for your patience and understanding.

16115,Stiletto Matte Swarovski Nails | Press On Nails | Fake Nails | False Nails | Glue On Nails | Acrylic Nails | Handpainted | Nail Art,"
            Simple and gorgeous.  A purple hued taupe gets the matte treatment and is accented by two crescents of genuine Swarovski crystals on the ring fingers.  The ultra glamorous stiletto shape adds to the drama.  
**Crystals will be on the size 5 nails, unless you request otherwise.**
The set of 12 will include a range of sizes that should fit most fingers - 0,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,6,7,8,9 (the width measurements are below, so please check before you order!)
If in doubt, move up and get the full set to ensure you have the sizes you'll need.
Size 0 : 1.5 cm
Size 1 : 1.3 cm
Size 2 : 1.2 cm
Size 3 : 1.15 cm 
Size 4 : 1.1 cm 
Size 5 : 1.0 cm 
Size 6 : 0.95 cm 
Size 7 : 0.9 cm 
Size 8 ; 0.8 cm 
Size 9 : 0.7 cm
Nails have been filed, painted, given a coat of topcoat, and then a final coat of gel topcoat and cured under a UV light to prolong wear without chipping.  Any crystals or rhinestones have been set with an industrial bonder.  The full set of 20 nails should fit most nail beds with minor adjustments.  You'll want to completely remove any old nail polish or oils and gently push your cuticles back before applying, to ensure a good fit. 
Included in your box will be a small ""make ready"" kit, consisting of an alcohol wipe, an orangewood stick, and a nail file.  I don't include glue or tabs with the listing, but they're readily available at most beauty stores.  If you break any, or would like a few more spares, message me and I can quote you for replacements.        ",16.00,4.8971,"Handmade item

✧We hand forge our bands with their special purpose in mind and make them strong so that they will last you for a lifetime. 
❥Kindly use the zoom function on the pictures provided as the smaller versions that populate on screen can be a bit grainy, however the zoomed photos are clear.
═Super Slim Notched Curved Spacer Band═
We designed this spacer band with a very slight notched curve. It features a mid-section clearance of ~1mm. This is popular with ladies who have rings with main center stones whose setting protrudes ever so slightly from the base where it meets the ring shank so that a traditional spacer ring without a notch would not sit flush with the main ring. When properly paired, the lower part of this spacer ring will sit flush against your main ring, while the notched portion curves daintily around the base of the setting of your main stone.
✧Ring size selection:
Recommended ring sizes are provided in the selection menu. If you would like a different size, simply select the ""My Size Preference"" option and use the notes section during checkout to leave us your preferred ring size. Kindly take a bit of care when wearing this ring in a size larger than recommended.
✧Wearing Style category: Spacer Band
Spacer band definition: A band created with a super slim profile both in width and height used to add a touch of space between two other rings. Spacer bands are not recommended as stand-alone rings although many ladies do enjoy them as such. Kindly exercise a bit of care if wearing this ring as a stand-alone fashion ring.

17070,stainless steel ring cuff / statement ring / boho rings / tube ring / armor ring / chunky ring / wide cuff ring / long ring,"
            Hand-cut, sanded for perfectly smooth edges, hammered or plain, these rings are made to last a lifetime! They are very sturdy, lightweight and comfortable; ideal for everyday wearing.
They are timeless and totally versatile when it comes to style. Each can be layered with other rings for a Boho chic look, or worn solo as a bold & modern statement piece. 
★ HOW ARE THESE RINGS CUSTOMIZABLE? ★
You can customize your own ring by choosing its width and texture. 
To figure out which width is most suitable for you, measure the distance between the knuckles of the finger you will wear it on. For width comparison, see images 3 & 4.
You can choose from 4 different widths:
1.5 cm (0.6"") tapered or non-tapered back *
2 cm (0.8"") tapered back
2.5 cm (1"") tapered back
3 cm (1.2"") tapered back
* Tapered back means they are shorter from the back. This makes them comfortable when you bend your fingers. The backs of all tapered rings measure 0.8 cm (a little more than 1/4"")
You can choose from 4 different textures / finishes:
Satin (plain  matte)
Mirror (plain  polished)
Stone (hammered  matte)

            A solid sterling silver chain, cable style, that can be made in any length you prefer! This is a fairly thin chain, just over 2 mm in width, but the links are soldered shut so it is still strong enough to hold a medium-sized pendant. It is NOT suitable for larger or heavy pendants. Click here: 
http://etsy.me/16uTgQ1
 to see other chains that may work better with heavier pendants
PLEASE NOTE that this is a heavier chain than I used to sell in this style; the end rings are also thicker and therefore stronger than the previous version. This chain ends in a basic lobster clasp, as shown in the third & fourth photo. 
I handcut these chains myself, so if you do not see your preferred length listed, please contact me for a custom order - all lengths are available. The listed options run from a choker style chain of 14 inches up to a very long 45 inch necklace.

Please note that I do not offer oval shaped labrets - all labrets will have a circular shape. Round or T-shaped backing are available.
These designs can be made from any wood you'd like, in sizes 2g(6mm)** through 3"" and beyond for this style. 
Other specifics such as length or size of round/t-backing are also available at your request.
**I am now offering as small as 2g(6mm) for labret/conch/nose pieces, however any available inlays would start at 0g(8mm) size jewelry.
Prices are per SINGLE for this particular style unless requested otherwise by you, and are given in USD currency. (all of my other offered styles are per PAIR unless requested otherwise)
✱Please do not purchase directly through this listing, which is an example listing for this style only, showing previously custom ordered jewelry. 
As everything is custom made, I need to speak with you directly about your order to give you an accurate price quote. The process is super easy. Please don't hesitate to contact me, I'm more than willing to work with you on your custom jewelry. 
To start your order, send me a convo with what you may be interested in for an accurate price quote.
Please include:
-Size, style/inlay, wood type (or color) etc.
-Include any and all photo references you'd like. 
Once we're on the same page, I will give you a price quote for your specific custom piece. 
From there, I'd set you up a reserved custom Etsy listing to purchase if you'd like to place an order.
I ALWAYS offer discounts on multiple-pair orders. 
Listing shows a base price for the style shown, which can vary depending on size, desired wood type, etc.
Please feel free to ask for a list of currently available wood types.
Information on what can be customized on your pair can be found in the Additional Information section of my shop policies.
You can view hundreds of custom plug examples to spark your creativity throughout the listings in my shop..
What you see in these listings are certainly not what you are limited to. The possibilities for your custom order are endless! I encourage creativity, and am always here to help.        ",16.00,4.9032,"Handmade item

*******************************
*what is gold filled?
Gold filled is a hollow tube of usually 14K gold that is filled with another metal. The exterior of the gold filled jewelry is solid karated gold and everything you can see or touch is a solid layer of karated gold.
This tube of karated gold is approximately 100 times thicker than gold plate. It is made by bonding with heat and pressure - with normal wear and tear the karated gold will never tarnish, chip or wear off. By law this layer of karated gold has to be at least 1/20 of the total weight of the metal portion of the piece of jewelry.
Many jewelry purchasers outside the jewelry trade mistakenly think 'gold filled' is the same as 'gold-plate'. 'Gold filled is a much higher quality product.
As less gold is being used gold-filled or rolled gold jewelry is a cost effective alternative to karated gold jewelry.

In case it's for someone special and you don't know their wrist size
Men: 8 inches (20.5cm approximately)

For a custom fit:
Wrap a piece of string around your wrist just over the wrist bone...not tight or loose, just a perfect measure. Cut the string and lay it flat on a measuring tape. If you provide that exact measurement, I will make sure to custom fit it to your wrist and allow enough length for leather, 
clasp and wiggle room.

TIGER's EYE properties:
Tigers Eye Stone is a crystal with lovely bands of yellow-golden color through it. This is a powerful stone that aids harmony and balance, and helps you to release fear and anxiety.
It stimulates taking action, and helps you to make decisions with discernment and understanding, and unclouded by your emotions.
Traditionally it was carried as an amulet against curses or ill-wishing, and is known to give you courage, self confidence and strength of will. It enhances creativity and is one of the stones that aid kundalini awakening.
This natural crystal balances the brain, so it may be of benefit to help those who are suffering from mental disease or with personality disorders.

*********MEASURING YOUR ANKLE SIZE:
Take a piece of non-stretchy string and encircle your ankle snugly (but not tightly). Measure the string, then add about a 1/2 inch. This will give you a pretty good size estimate for an anklet that falls below the ankle bone.***********

As with all my crochet baby shoes and baby booties these are made with soft yarn and are hand washable. These baby shoes are soft gray with a white sole and white yarn ties. If you want this in custom colors just let me know.
The heel of the shoe is made to curve inward slightly to help the bootie stay on baby's foot, and the yarn tie is functional to allow for a snug fit while also being able to get it on and off more easily.
Sizes:
XS - 3 1/2"" length (approx. 0-3 months)
S   - 4"" length (approx. 3-6 months)
M  - 4 1/4"" length (approx. 6-9 months)

20443,Black Obi Belt / Sash Oriental Japanese Geisha style by loobyloucrafts ... Kimono Yukata belt wrap ... Standard size,"
            Looby Lou obi belt
This is my standard size obi belt.
It adapts well to different waist measurements.
Recommended for a waist measuring 25 inches to 32 inches / 63.5 cm to 81 cm.
I have too longer options of this black belt in my shop if you would a longer version :)
My Looby Lou obi belts are inspired by the Japanese obi but I have adapted them for the modern women! They are easy and comfortable to wear. They can really give an outfit that extra wow factor and individual twist.
Here are a few style suggestions:
-  go traditional and wear one with a kimono  
-  wear with a long flowing skirt or dress for a festival boho look
-  go ethnic and tie your obi over harem style pants
-  be elegant and wear it with a pretty dress 
-  for a smart look wear with a blouse and skirt
-  or be casual with denim jeans/shorts and t shirt 
the possibilities are really endless ..... as is the way you tie your obi belt! 
The front panel is pleated into the ties. This gives the obi belt a unique shape, creating small folds that make it easy to wear whilst being versatile.
It is great for cinching in the waist! The ties can be tied at the back or can be wrapped around and tied at the front. There are so many ways to wear this belt - have fun with it!
Made from a plain matt black cotton mix fabric.

  All of our belts are handmade in our shop in NW Florida. We start with 100% solid leather blanks. There are over a dozen steps in the creation of these belts, all of which are completed in our shop. Belt edges are beveled in order to provide more comfort and prevent cutting into clothing. 
  Belts are dyed and treated with several finish and top coats in order to provide colorfastness and durability. Belt edges are dyed and treated in order to provide more protection to the leather and add to the appearance of the belt. All belts are provided with a leather keeper and a standard harness buckle but are finished off with snaps at the buckle end in order to allow changing of the buckle if desired.
  
   Our goal is to provide a quality leather accessory that will provide many years of service. We have been doing this for almost fifteen years. We sell locally and work many craft shows annually and have many customers that buy from us repeatedly and look for us every year to fulfill their personal and gift needs. We stand behind our products and strive for repeat customers. If you are dissatisfied in any way please contact us and we will work with you in order to achieve your satisfaction.
