2570,Gucci Sweater. Rugby Style. Purchased in 1977. Excellent Condition. Made in Italy. Size 48. Red Blue Stripe. Relaxed Sleeves.,"
            Please note that we are the ORIGINAL owner of this vintage sweater.  It has been brought to our attention that someone has ""borrowed"" this listing from us.  We have not authorized this listing on any other selling site.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gucci Sweater. Vintage late 1970s. Excellent Condition. Made in Italy. Size 48. Red Blue Stripe. Relaxed Sleeves.
This is from Decotini's personal collection.
Purchased new around 1977 at the (at that time brand new) Gucci Store in the old Allerton Hotel on Michigan Ave in Chicago.  (Gucci still has a store on Michigan Ave, but it is in a different building.)
No odors
No smoke
No pets
No piling
No stains
No tears or rips.
Every cleaning has been by a  professional dry cleaner.
This was gently worn a few times, then put in the closet and forgotten.
CONDITION
Beautiful condition.
The ONLY issue we find is that the cleaning direction tag is literally hanging by one thread.  It is an easy easy fix, but we left it that way for you. The other tags have a few threads, as you can see in the extreme closeup photo.
SIZE - marked Italian size 48 (about a medium).
Please see our photo #3 for the detailed measurements.
Please ask if we left something important off (we don't list many clothes online).
GENDER
This was a man's sweater in the 1970s, however I think it will lend itself well as a lady's sweater.
COLOR:
This red was very difficult to photograph.  I tried 2 cameras in 2 locations, and could not quite get it.  It is a bright Cherry Red, with deep navy stripes.  There are 2 very dark green accent stripes on each shoulder.
Photo #4 shows the best representation of color.
FABRIC
50% wool, 50% acrylic
100% cotton decoration (edging on the packet collar)
STYLE
This has a classic Rugby style, with a bit of updated 1970s type styling.
The sleeves are relaxed, not quite dollman sleeves, just a boxy cut rather than a fitted shoulder.  
There is a  4.75"" placket opening, with 2 wonderful GUCCI ITALY metal snaps.
If I forgot anything, or you need more info, please ask and I will get back with you as soon as possible.        ",215.00,4.9653,"Vintage handmade item from the 1980s

2878,Vintage Bakelite Buttons. Figural Horseshoes.  Still on Sample Card. 1940s.,"
            Six fabulous old vintage bakelite carved horse shoe buttons.
These are still attached on a slice of a sample board, amazingly so.  The cardboard has been folded (by the yellow button), so it could totally break off at some point.  It could be reinforced on the back with tape, if desired.  We didn't want to do that.
Typically for bakelite, some of the colors have turn dark over the years.  Originally they would have been black, red, purple (or hot pink), green, yellow, and blue.  
Each one is about 3/4"" long.  
Charming figural buttons.
Great addition for a button collection.        ",70.00,4.9653,"Vintage item from the 1940s

MY STORY:
After a medical accident left me paralyzed in 2013, life changed dramatically for me. Having just graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design, I was now at a major crossroad with what to do with my life. With some introspection at the major hurdles I had just overcome, I realized what a profound impact the support and wonderful cards I recieved had made on me throughout my journey. Just that little laugh, that little escape from reality is what I needed to pull me through the hardships. And I realized if they helped me, they would help others! And I wanted to be a part of that. With that, I decided to start Cypress Card Co! 
ALL ABOUT THE CARDS:
I run Cypress Card Co. from my home in Stillwater, Oklahoma. I conceive, design, illustrate, cut, score and package each card (The whole shebang!). I aim to create cards that have a fresh, fun, quirky take on life- every card is designed to make people smile! But don’t be mistaken, these are not your grandma's greeting cards! 
***BONUS! I also aim to be as ENVIRONMENTAL-FRIENDLY as possible. Umm...what does that mean you say?
- Each card is made with premium 100% recycled FSC heavy card stock
- Soy-based inks and white background to minimize inks
- Comes with 100% recycled kraft envelope
- Biodegradable/compostable cello sleeve
- 100% recycled kraft mailer/packaging
- Offset carbon footprint with renewable energy voucher

7212,Cat House  Outdoor Cat Shelter Condo For Your Rescue Cat-Comfy Insulated For your Kitten-The Best Cat Lover Gift,"
            Cat houses made with cedar wood will keep your cat warm and dry during winter conditions! Provide your cat with somewhere safe to hang out with our outdoor cat shelter.
Constructed from solid 3/4"" thick cedar wood boards, our outdoor cat shelter is weather-resistant with an overhanging pitched roof to allow rainwater to run off. The comfortable interior 22” x 15 x 11” H is roomy enough for large cats to move around and settle down, and can accommodate a variety of kitty heating pads. Featuring a 5 1/2 “ x 24”  front deck, 6” x 8”door with raised threshold, and a 5” x 5” side window which adds light and can be used as a lookout or escape route, our wooden cat house is perfect for cats who don't like to feel closed in. Detachable vinyl flaps on the door and window keep the elements out, and there are two flat support boards to raise the cat house off the ground. A custom pin and hook system keeps the roof in place and is useful for hanging up kitty's favorite toy. The roof is easy to remove for ease of internal cleaning.
The weather and bug-resistant solid cedar wood is sanded smooth. The wood will weather over time to a light gray patina or can be stained, sealed, or painted by you. No assembly required, simply attach the roof bracket and roof.
•	Standard Cat House - Composed of a single outdoor cat kennel and ideal for one cat. 
•	Double Deck Two Level Cat House - Measures 24” wide x 24” L x 36” H and is ideal for cats who like                               their privacy! Each level has its own deck, and the door and window are in reverse positions. Our Extra Wide Stand is a good additional option when purchasing this split level outdoor cat shelter, to give your cat       room to reach the top level.
•	Stand - Features cedar wood sides and pressure-treated legs for durability. A great way to provide extra protection from wet ground. Measuring 12” H the stand offers a higher view and an extra hiding place. Shipped free when ordered with a cat house, and partially assembled.
•	Extra Wide Stand - A great partner to our two level outdoor cat shelter! Measures 5½ wide x 24”. 
•	Vinyl Flaps - Attached to the door and window of our outdoor cat kennels, these industrial-grade vinyl flaps help keep the wind and rain out and provide extra warmth for your cat.
•	Optional Insulation - Solid 1” thick claw-resistant foam insulation can be added to the roof, floor, and all four sides of
Our wooden cat houses to keep kitty warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

working with larger soft wires/metals up to
12 ga. (2 mm). Handles are approximately 6”
(152 mm) long and shaped to fit well in larger to
medium size hands to provide good cutting leverage.
This is a perfect ‘go-to’ cutter and the orange handle
will always be visible on your work bench!
These cutters have a unique blade design - they bypass cut like a pair of scissors.  Most flush cutter blades meet, which causes them to dull over time.  These cutters will last much longer and give a better cut.

14787,Transfered Embroidery Kit: 'Sophie' (Pink) Lovely Sampler! Beautiful Kits By Maggie Gee Needlework Studio,"
            Embroidery Kits from The Maggie Gee Embroidery Studio
'SOPHIE' Embroidery Kit : Pink (Also available in Lemon!)
Hello and Welcome to my Kits!
This design has a bit of everything in it and makes the perfect practice piece or beginner sampler. It contains Detached Chain Stitches, basic Silk Shading, Beads, Stem Stitch & Satin Stitch. There are two gorgeous colour choices of soft pinks and blues or lemons. 
I design and assemble my kits at my studio and am always on hand to help and encourage through e-mail or my Facebook page (Maggie Gee Needlework Studio).
My kits contain the finest Dmc threads and Irish Linen and I am probably one of the only designers to include backing fabric and details about how to prepare your piece as well as how to lace it in preparation for mounting and framing. They contain the correct sized needles for the stitch or width of thread needed and the threads are pre-sorted onto cards and the fabric pressed and lightly scented. My embroidery kits even enclose a Needle Threader! All my instructions are fully illustrated and contain detailed stitch glossaries. My kits are packed in good quality cellophane bags and would make lovely presents.
Whether you are new to embroidery, returning to it after some years or indeed, a seasoned embroiderer, my kits are designed to enable you not only to be thrilled with your achievements, but result in you embroidering to a professional standard and learning many new techniques. 
Pattern Size 14cm x 17cm.......
I'm sure I don't need to tell you the hoop is NOT included in the kit!! (See Notes below)
I am sure readers understand that colour reproduction of my pictures depend on your device screen and the way you actually see colours! Likewise my camera and lighting may catch colours differently but with the exceptions of creams looking a bit paler, I work really hard to make sure my colours are really accurately reproduced in my listings. 
KIT OPTIONS:
TRANSFERED KIT
The design is transferred onto the linen but I have enclosed the pattern template and instructions for  tracing onto the fabric, should the pattern be too faint. The transfer does NOT wash off and the idea is to sew over the lines. Choose the 'Transferred Kit' Option 
NON-TRANSFERED KIT
Some Embroiderers dislike having the design pre-printed onto the linen and prefer to trace the pattern using a template (enclosed), light box and fine pencil. There is an option to choose plain fabric in the drop-down box. Just choose the ‘Non-Transferred Kit’ Option
BEGINNER ADD ON INSTRUCTIONS OPTION (Read Carefully)
I pride myself on clear instructions in my kits and the ability of my customers to produce something wonderful but in this 8 page guide I want talk about the preparation and basics of embroidery that, although incorporated in my standard Kits, don’t need to be covered in as much depth for experienced embroiderers.
In this set of instructions I explain what hoops to use, how to prepare a hoop, how to tell one needle from another, how to use basic embroidery cotton and sew backing fabric to linen. I enclose my Top 10 Tips such as how to do the perfect French Knot and where to look for patterns and pictures – all the basics that will give you the confidence to go on to other projects, learn other stitches and explore other techniques within my kit collection.
PLEASE NOTE: These notes are generic and are NOT INDIVIDUALLY TAYLORED TO EACH SEPERATE KIT.... Therefore if you are ordering TWO Kits, you will only need ONE set! I cannot chase up every single order so if more than one set have been ordered with multiple kits, I will assume they have been ordered for other people. Kits with the Beginner Instructions are Pre-Transferred.
LIKEWISE: If you have purchased the Beginner Blossoms Kit, then you WON'T NEED the Add-On!
LANGUAGE NOTE : Instructions are written in ENGLISH. I do NOT offer Digital Downloads for translation and therefore it is up to you to seek your own translation from the written instruction. All instructions and stitches are fully illustrated.
**********************************************************************************
A NOTE ABOUT EMBROIDERY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW…..
Embroidery is an Art and as such it is not an instantaneous hobby. My kits enclose probably the most comprehensive and professional instructions you’ll find on the market ,and all the materials to get you going and complete the design, but please note you will need other items such as thread to sew on your backing fabric, a frame, pins and an ironing board, full details of which are described within the kit. I have written this note just in case you plan to take your kit on holiday and are new to sewing of any kind and have not yet had fun acquiring the basics required for the hobby.( Again described in the instructions or found in any good sewing book/internet site prior to starting.)
A NOTE ON HOOPS & FRAMES......
Probably one of the most popular questions I get asked is ‘What kind of hoop shall I use?’ The simple answer is to use a ‘hands free’ hoop. You will no doubt be used to the simple hand held embroidery hoops, but a hoop which enables us to use both hands means that you are free to manipulate the threads. Elbessse do an excellent one which comes with a standard 10’ hoop. There are two styles; a hoop with a  clamp for a table, or one with a base to fit under the leg so that it can be used on your lap. You’ll find them on Ebay or any good sewing shop and they should cost under £20 (29) A word of caution ; If you are buying a Table clamp, make sure the lip of your table edge  is square and less than 2 inches deep for the clamp to attach properly. Further details are in my instructions.
SEWING GROUPS/BULK ORDERS.....
I give a 10% discount for x20 kits or orders over £270.00 (approx. 338.00 as of Feb 2017)  more for those of you wishing to teach or sew any of my kits as a group. Before ordering, let me know so that I can make sure the correct quantities are available. Orders can be mixed  eg. 5x 4 different kits). These orders will take an extra couple of days to prepare so leave plenty of time......Order as normal and use the code 'grouporder001' to obtain your discount.
POSTAGE  is at total of £40 (to 4kg) for the US and elsewhere and £16.95 (to 5kg) for the UK. Overseas orders will be split into x2 2kg parcels and will be sent Tracked and Signed For. The UK will be sent 1st Class Signed For. Any Overpayment for postage will be refunded back to you.... CLICK ON the Postal Upgrades ; UK Group or Overseas Group option at Checkout.
Please Note : I do NOT sell wholesale to shops and this is my ONLY discount. 
***********************************************************************************
Finally, If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me or visit me  on Facebook to see my other work!
***********************************************************************************
POSTAGE - PLEASE READ!! 
UK 1st Class Signed For (1-2 Working Days).....The great news is that you will probably be receiving your order just as I'm marking it as 'shipped' on Etsy as I can't record the Tracking until I get the receipt the day after it is posted!! 
Standard International Postage : Europe £3.70 ; USA  £ 4.75 & Australia £ 5.05 
Parcels take a day extra to get to the UK Mainland from here on the Isle of Wight and will take up to 20 working days (Mon-Fri) to reach some parts of the United States and Australia. Asia, Brazil, Mexico, UAE and more far flung places  can take a full month up to 30 Working Days to reach their destination. PLEASE!!!!! BE PATIENT! Items RARELY go missing and I DO know the system!! I will only offer re-posting or a refund after 32 working days.
PLEASE ; Check your address is correct on both Etsy and PayPal. I'm a nice person but don't appreciate spending hours chasing UK Royal Mail for re-delivery and technically I am not obliged to re-send!!!

14877,"1mm Leather Cord Natural Dye, 3 yards, Choose Color, Ready to Ship!","
            1mm Leather Cord Natural Dye, 3 yards, Choose Color, Ready to Ship!
3 yards of premium, dyed leather cord - 1mm.  Precision cut from the center of the hide, this Round Leather Lace offers the finest in quality and consistency. Great for braiding, beading, necklaces, fine lacing, earrings, hair ornamentation, and more. This Round Leather Cord is genuine leather and is the finest available.  Certified lead -free dyes were used to color this beautiful cord.  Choose from all the color options.
I chose this leather cord because it works beautifully with both my 6mm and 8mm copper beads - see the last pic. If you buy multiples of this listing I will send one length.
I also carry this leather in 10 meter spools: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/482682760/1mm-leather-cord-natural-dye-10-meter?ref=shop_home_active_1
The Natural dyes are an absorbed dye whereby the cord is dipped in the dye, the cord absorbs the dye, and then the cord is heat sealed. Because the dye is absorbed rather than coated, the cord is softer and more flexible than regular cord. This process allows the natural color of the cord to come through. In some colors, it presents somewhat of a ""tie-dye"" look. All Natural dye colors present a ""flat"" color versus a shiny color.
This leather product is free of Lead, AZO’s, PCP, Mercury, Formaldehyde, Chromium VI, Cadmium and other carcinogenic/hazardous chemicals. It meets CPSIA standards. 
There is an industry tolerance of /- 0.3mm when manufacturing leather cording. This would mean that a 1mm cord can be as large as 1.3mm or as small as 0.7mm. Additionally, due to the natural properties of leather, leather can expand or contract according to the climate, moisture, heat and/or how it is stored. The hides themselves will also affect the size of the cord. Hides can, and do vary, in thickness, even those from the same animal.
I have lots of leather cord and clasps in my shop:
https://www.etsy.com/shop/SupplyYourSoul/search?search_query=leather&order=date_desc&view_type=gallery&ref=shop_search
Leather cord is produced from cowhides - and the hide eventually ends and a new one begins.  Some companies splice together the cords, which produces an invisible, but weak connection.  My manufacturer chooses not to disguise the connection - and simply ties the two ends together.  If the tied end occurs in the length that I am cutting for you, I will add an additional yard of cord to your order, free of charge. 
*******CUT LENGTHS OF WIRE OR CORD ARE NOT RETURNABLE.  PLEASE BE SURE OF THE LENGTH AND SIZE YOU NEED BEFORE PURCHASING.  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE CONTACT ME. *******        ",4.00,4.9653,"Craft type: Beading, Jewelry making, Kids' crafts, Leatherworking, Shoemaking

✩ BRACELET SIZE & SPECIAL REQUESTS ✩
The bracelet measures 16 to 19 cm, thanks to its small adjustment chain, which corresponds to the average of feminine wrists. If you or the person you intend to offer the bracelet has a particularly fine or strong wrist, please mention it in your order in the ""Note to Seller"" (with the measurement of that wrist, it's even better!) So that I adjusted the bracelet accordingly. In the case of customed manufacturing, you need to add 1 to 2 additional days to the order process.
✩ NEAT & NICE PACKAGING - READY TO OFFER ✩
All the details are important when we want to please a loved one, especially with the holiday season that is approaching!
Either the bracelet is for you, or for the person you want to offer it, it receives the same treatment.
it is delicately lying on a small translucent coton mattress which is closed with a laced white paper, all enclosed in a small box made of recycled paper (chic and eco-friendly!). Guaranteed gift effect!
✩ PERSONAL MESSAGE AS YOU LIKE ✩

            Very full, extra fluffy, boutique~style,  sewn tutu in rainbow colors with a hot pink satin bow. 
This tutu is super full and fluffy. All tutu sizes have the same amount of fullness, the only difference between them is the length. I offer multiple lengths that are standard for each size. If you prefer a different length than is listed here, please message me for a custom listing.
I recommend measuring your little ones' waist size, prior to placing an order. My tutus are made with a stretchy, non-roll, elastic waistband. The waistbands on my tutus are made to fit snugly on the waist but also to comfortably stretch several inches larger (to allow for ease of dressing and pulling over any clothing, if necessary). This will also allow your child to grow with the tutu and will extend the length of time the tutu can be worn. When measuring waist size for your tutu, please wrap measuring tape along natural waist (right above hip bones). Do not measure over bulky clothing and be sure the measuring tape is sitting snug along the waist but not binding (for accurate measurement).
When deciding on a tutu length, it is important to note that the shorter a tutu is, the more the tulle will fluff out instead of hang down. This is especially true for the shorter tutus. The numeric length shown for the shorter tutus (6 or 8 inches) is the tulle length used for the skirt, not necessarily how long the tutu actually is (since the tulle will fluff out). The longer tutus are usually closer to measurements for length (10 inches and longer).
I offer the following standard waist measurements for each size:
Size 0-6 months~13/14 inch waist
6 inch length
Size 6-12 months~16 inch waist
6 or 8 inch length
Size 12-24 months (1-2 years)~18 inch waist
6, 8 or 10 inch length
Size 3T-4T (3-4 years): 20 inch waist
8, 10 or 12 inch length
Size 5-6 (5-6 years): 22 inch waist
10, 12 or 14 inch length
Size 7-8 (7-9 years): 23 inch waist
10, 12, or 14 inch length
All Cheeky Crows tutus are handmade by me. I hand cut, design, sew or create each tutu myself using only premium, diamond weave, nylon tulle and quality ribbons and accessories. All materials have been tested as required.
I offer many colors and styles of tutus and dresses at my Etsy shop at this link:
www.etsy.com/shop/thecheekycrows
If you need your outfit shipped sooner, please message me and let me know what day you need it by. I will let you know if I can get it to you in that time-frame.
If you need a rush on any tutu, please message me. The cost of rush processing is 10.00 and guarantees I will place your order at the front of the line for shipping within 2 business days (as long as I have time in my schedule to fit you in and have agreed to the rush). The link to add rush processing to your cart is here:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/245859058/tutuoutfit-rush-processing-fee?ref=shop_home_active_8
I also offer this tutu as a hand knotted tutu on a crochet waistband. Please message me for a custom listing if you prefer this style of tutu.
My tutus make wonderful baby shower gifts, birthday presents or just any day gift for that special princess in your life. Perfect for all those first year photo sessions, including a cake smash.
I have many color options for my tutus...please let me know if you would like a different color or something custom added to your tutu, such as a bow, ribbon or flower. I am happy to create a custom order just for you!
If material is out of stock or discontinued, I *may* substitute the item for something similar. Please message me with your order is this is not acceptable.
I will always combine multiple purchases for shipping, if I can. However, if you are ordering more than one tutu, I don't recommend trying to combine shipping for your tutus since this can crush your tutu. I ship all tutus in a way that will maintain as much fluff as possible during shipping. FYI: I offer a 5% discount for all multi-tutu purchases (must purchase 2 or more tutus in one purchase to qualify).
Please do not leave any tutu or headband unattended with a baby or small child to prevent any choking or breathing hazard.        ",28.00,4.9653,"Handmade item
