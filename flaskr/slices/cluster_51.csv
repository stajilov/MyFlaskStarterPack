281,Vintage Suitcase Leather Storage Travel Display Shabby,"
            A classic vintage shabby suitcase from the 40's. Hard sides, covered with cream leather with sturdy plastic handle. It has metal feet and latches. Inside is satin lined and has gathered pocket. 
Some stains and missing emblem logo. There is no key, but latches work great and the feet on the base are sturdy. Inside there are some stains and is pulling away where it was glued to the outside shell. But the lining is intact- no holes or tears.
This is a great suitcase for storage, display or could be creatively transformed into something else. Look carefully at the photos - I have tried to picture it accurately.

            These are quite unusual in shape and are really a nice size and beautifully made! Fairly heavy. The design is Romanesque. A figure wearing a turban with a music instrument under one arm and a staff in the other hand. Vintage, Made in Paris France. 
  These pieces are not easily bendable. They are die struck from molds.
** Many of the French pieces I offer for sale were purchased directly from France many years ago. They came from the left over inventory of a closed jewelry shop in Paris. Others were purchased recently from the same French Parisian manufacturer who supplied the jewelry shop. They have been in business since 1890. 
         Most of their vintage stampings that I offer here are available in quite limited quantities. New models from their old tooling machines are available in unlimited quantities. *Please contact me if you are interested in purchasing a quantity of 300 pieces or more of one specific model at a reduced cost. (thats their minimum)
  ~~ Shipping fee applies to 1st item only. FREE SHIPPING for more than one item purchased in one order.

3105,"Vintage Leather Fur Rug or Fur Blanket or Fur Quilt, Western Quilt, Americana Quilt","
            Vintage Leather Fur Rug, fur quilt, or leather blanket. Crazy fun Western Quilt or Americana Quilt. Check out this crazy over the top vintage quilt, blanket, or rug made out of fur and leather patchwork. Who knew this was out in the world. This is a vintage quilt in fur with a leather backing in a Western style with a traditional star pattern quilt design. The back of the quilt is all leather, but the front is what appears to be a mix of real and fake fur. It is possible it is all real fur, but not an expert and some of the fur seems synthetic while other sections looks to be real. This appears to be handmade based on the stitching on the back. Would work great in a cabin or western themed space. 
Dimensions: Roughly 5'1"" x 5'1"" 
Condition: Fabric Edging of the quilt  has started to separate. There are a few places where the stitching has started to separate on the inside, but only noticed if you pull on it in 2 directions.  No really obvious stains or smells, but it does have the smell of a vintage piece of leather or fur if you decide to stick your nose in it for some time to try to smell it which I did(LOL), but no mothballs or cigarette smells that I could sniff out. At a normal distance nothing noticeable about it other then the edging is starting to separate. 
Shipping: It is a bit heavy to ship as it is leather so feel free to email me directly with your zip code and I can check if another shipping company such as FED-X is cheaper. I usually ship same day or next day.  I will ship Fed-X Home Delivery if the rate is better or the same as USPS. Will be shipped using recycled shipping materials to keep costs down.  I am always happy to bundle this item with other items to keep shipping costs down.  I do refund shipping costs if I end up shipping at a cheaper rate and the amount saved is over 5. Happy to provide free local Seattle pick up and possibly open to delivery just message me to arrange. Washington State Residents pay sales tax. 
Always happy to provide additional photos or answer any questions.

4604,1800s Men's Vest 1860s Vest 1870s Vest Silk Vest Civil War Vest Original 1800s 1800s Clothing 19th Century Mens Vest 19th Century Clothing,"
            This listing is for a beautiful original 1800's men's silk vest! Finding original clothing from this period is getting rarer and rarer, so to find one that's in relatively good condition is even better!
The vest bears all of the hallmark style points that lead us to believe it's from the 1860's or 1870's, and is approximately Civil War-era. It has a silk front with a shawl collar and fabric-covered buttons. The back and inside lining appears to be cotton.
It is in very old, but good, condition, especially for its age. The silk does have some discolouration, as does the cotton. There is some staining under the arm holes from sweat (pretty typical of clothing from this period). All of the buttons are present and intact, though they do have some discolouration and a few are stained. The top buttonhole has some light damage immediately to its right. 
The belt in the back is intact and even has a brass buckle with an 1855 patent date! (See photo for details!)
Initials (presumably those from the original owner) are written in what appears to be pencil inside. They are ""P.G.""
There is a repair under the right arm hole (see photo). We are unsure if this was done in-period or was a later addition. We do not have any blacklight capability to test it under UV at this time and did not want to risk damaging the integrity of the garment by performing a burn test on the thread used for the repair, so we are unsure as to the period of said repair, sorry. There are a few other small nips in the fabric in various places.
While quite old, the vest does appear to still be wearable, if only lightly, though we recommend using it simply as a study piece or to possibly gauge a pattern from.
That said, there is no size anywhere on the vest, so our measurements are as follow:
Across chest, pit to pit (buttoned, lying flat): 19.5""

5371,"Flower painting, vintage oil painting, still life, still life painting, oil painting, flower still life, vintage still life, vintage flower","
            I have recently found two beautiful oil paintings from an art collector in Utrecht that is downsizing his collection.
This floral still life is vibrant and comes in a beautiful frame. The painting is oil on canvas, then pasted onto a wood panel. This is called the Marouflé technique. It  is signed J. Molenaar. Most likely, this has been painted by the artist Johannes Petrus (Joop) Molenaar. The collector believes it was painted by that artist in the 1940s. Joop Molenaar is best known for his paintings of shipyards and harbor views, but this painting was so vibrant, colorful, and happy I couldn't pass it up!
Height: 21.5 inches
Width: 17.5 inches
Please note there are some signs of age that can be seen in the photos. At the top left of the painting the wood panel, and consequently the painting, is chipped. This is not obvious from a distance, but I do need to disclose that. It can be seen in photo 4.
The second thing to note is there are small marks on the very left edge of the painting where it looks like a nail that holds the painting in the frame rubbed against it. Please see photo 5. Finally, the frame has a crack in the lower left hand corner as well as the upper right hand corner- to me it adds character, but I do want to point that out.
When I got the painting there was duck tape on the back to hold the panel in the frame in addition to the nails that are usually found. I have chosen to let the buyer decide if they want to remove it or not- it does have a sturdy wire across the back and is ready for hanging.
The price does reflect these few blemishes. I hope to find a good home for this beautiful piece.
Please message me with any questions.        ",438.60,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1940s

            Check out that extreme, one-eye-visible tilt! So very femme fatale! Glossy black feathers, black felt birds, giant satin bow and a chin length veil! 
Details:
- this is a properly blocked hat, beautifully and firmly formed for the perfect tilt
- embellished with shiny raven feathers, a glossy satin bow, and two felt bird shaped adornments
- veiling can be tucked up over the brim or pulled down over the face
- label reads: Doeskin Reg'd Finish which is in reference to the manufacturer of the hat body and not the milliner
Measurements:
- 22 inch inner circumference and shown on a 22 inch mannequin head
- best for a 21 or 22 inch head
- this hat was blocked for an extreme tilt as shown in the photos, it will extend past your eyebrow but not obstruct your vision
Condition:
- excellent vintage condition
- no flaws, breaks, damage or discolouring
- some wear to inner brim, not noticeable when worn
- the original elastic thread which helped to secure the hat to one's head is broken but I have left it in place as a point of reference in which to have it replaced or to help orientate the hat upon one's head, it is not needed to wear this hat

______________________________
What is Nose Work?
Created in 2006, Nose Work is an easy-to-learn search and scenting activity or competitive sport that can help build your dog’s confidence and focus; no prior training or obedience needed. Shy or fearful dogs can build confidence and overactive dogs can put their energy into fun searches as they learn independent problem-solving skills and are disciplined through training. Cooperation between trainer and dog will build stronger bonds and relationships. The new urban sport of Nose Work is for dogs of all ages, personalities, and sizes!
Official Association (not sponsored): https://www.nacsw.net 
Instructions:
1. While your dog is preoccupied with a different activity, hide their favorite toys or treats in different compartments of the mat.
2. After completion, have your dog smell another one of their toys with their saliva scent or the same treat.
3. Release your dog onto the mat. If your dog is having trouble locating the designated object, pat around the general area of the target to encourage the dog to search or sniff. (This is more likely to happen if it is one of the dog’s first sessions)
4. After one to two sessions (varies per dog), the dog will need little to no guidance and the mat may be used a preoccupation during your absence.
WASHING INSTRUCTIONS: Spot wash preferred for maximum lifetime. If to be machine washed, use cold water and gentle wash individually. Do not tumble dry! 
DISCLAIMER: This mat is not advertised as indestructible. Despite its versatility, after prolonged use it will eventually wear, tear, and break. Not recommended for over 65 lb dogs.        ",149.00,5.0,"Handmade item

7437,Bath Bomb Sale - Clearance Bath Bombs - Bath Bomb Discount - Cheap Bath Bombs,"
            These bath bombs are just discontinued and I need to make room for new product. So that means awesome discounts for you! With the price being cut by over 40%, you can get a luxurious, relaxing bath bomb for a great price! These products are not broken or cracked or anything of that sort, just moving some overstock of product. 
These bath bombs weigh between 7-8 ounces and are large enough for two baths. However, I personally recommend using one per bath. 
The Epsom salts help relax your muscles while and coconut and sunflower oil help renew and soften your skin.
Directions:
Simply fill up a bath with warm/hot water, unwrap the bath bomb from its plastic, drop the bath bomb in tub, it will fizz for up to 5-6 minutes while it releases the oils and aroma into the bath. Get in and enjoy a relaxing bath!
Ingredients: Sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, Epsom salt, cornstarch, sunflower oil, fragrance oil, water, mica powder colorant, glitter
I highly recommend using our products as soon as possible for the best bathing experience since they are preservative free. The fresher the better! Store in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight until use.

★★★ ABOUT THE ITEM: ★★★

★★★ ABOUT THE ARTIST: ★★★
..................................................................
The art of Samantha Wortelhock – whether fine-art paintings or large public murals – is naïve, untutored, purely instinctive. She is an artist because she is a dreamer and storyteller.
  
In January, 1988, the year of bicentenary, Sam left the UK to travel to Australia, lured by stories of a primordial land and an ancient culture, and encouraged by a partner who had spent an idyllic childhood in Sydney. She found the city seemingly devoid of Aboriginality, yet the coastal landscape captivated her eager spirit and spoke of a hidden secret.
  
And so Sam started to paint – each night “requesting” a dream that would lead to a painting. On the night of her 22nd birthday, she dreamt her first painting, Balance. It was to become the blueprint for a collection of art that has captivated, educated and inspired many disparate groups of people to look more closely into Aboriginality and the value of preserving our natural world - intricate chronicles full of humour, insight and respect.
 
Sam’s art took her quickly to the pinnacle of commercial success, including fetching record prices in regional Australia. She was the brains behind the Mulgara Gallery at Uluru and established and owned Heaven and Earth Gallery in Sydney’s Queen Victoria Building and Field of Dreams in Queen Street Woollahra. 
Today, Sam has expanded her focus from original paintings, lithographs and Giglee prints and has ventured more into vivid and eye-catching murals both for schools and for community; portraits on a commissioned basis; and contributed paintings to books.
If interested in purchasing Giglee canvas prints or Original Paintings of Sam’s work, you can purchase on www.breakawayart.com.au.

Cathedral of the Mantle of Our Lady, also known as Saint Basil's Cathedral is an Orthodox Temple located on the Red Square in Moscow. It is a widely known monument of Russian architecture. Until the XVII century it was commonly called the Trinity Cathedral, as the original wooden church was dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The temple was also known as Jerusalem Cathedral due to the dedication of one of the chapels, as well as the being the destination for the Patriarch's religious procession from the Cathedral of the Assumption on Palm Sunday, called the Donkey Walk. St. Basil's Cathedral was built in 1555-1561 by the order of Ivan IV (the Terrible) to commemorate the capture of Kazan and the victory over the Kazan Khanate, which happened exactly on the day of the Intercession of the Mother of God - in the beginning of October 1552. As the legend has it, the architects of the cathedral (Barma and Postnik) were blinded by the order of Ivan the Terrible, so they could never build another such temple.

9881,Custom LED Lightsaber Style 2,"
            Unlike many sabers you will find, this saber is fully customizable using the MHS system. This means that you can keep upgrading, change the hilt design, or change the electronics. Some of the features include: a very bright Cree Star LED, aircraft grade aluminum hilt, and an extremely durable, removable Polycarbonate blade. This is an excellent option if you want something that is both well-constructed and affordable.
         If you are interested in seeing a demo of this Lightsaber with the 4x AAA with Sound option, check out this quick video where a demonstrate a few of the sounds and how to take remove the chassis to change the battery's.
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8NGvJWm8CEk
	If you plan on doing little or no sparring then I would recommend the 4 AAA battery pack but if you are planning on sparring a lot then the 18650 would be the best option. Both the  18650 option and the 4x AAA option also include a very nice chassis system which enhances the durability and overall niceness of the saber. On average 4 AAA will last around 1 hour vs. an 18650 which will last almost 3 hours.

10966,Arduino Smart Robot Avoidance Car Kit with Micro Processor and Code,"
            OVERVIEW
Interested in electronics, want to get into the Arduino or just looking for that different present, then you need the
Complete Ultrasonic Robot Car Avoidance Kit
See our first attempt at a You Tube Video HERE
This kit includes everything (excluding batteries) to build a working Ultrasonic Avoidance Robot Car, including our own development code pre loaded on the Arduino Pro Mini.
Once built turn it on and you are ready to go. Building the robot is only a fraction of the fun. The code will also be provided so that you can modify the way the Robot Car functions.
We have written an Arduino sketch that shows how to control the movements of the car. When completed you could always add the Infrared Kit that we sell to turn it into a Infrared Robot Car  or even a GPS. You are really only limited by your imagination.
Its very rare that we get time to play with the products we sell, so when I got the opportunity to develop the code for this kit I jumped at the chance!!
NOTE
The kit comes complete with the micro processor already pre-programmed, however should you wish to modify the operation or add new devices you will need the programming device.

            Blind Date, Jerzy Kosinski, Paperback Literature, 1977. 
In average condition.  Bantam Book Edition 1978, 2nd printing.  I purchased this book when it was new.  There appears to be no writing or underlining.  The spine and cover is good, no pages beginning to come loose.  Does have some staining.  See the 3rd picture for publisher, reprintings, and dates.  The pictures of the open book were taken by putting a sized thick piece of plexiglass on top of the open pages.  No damage was done to the book.  I have always lived in a non-smoking home. 
If you purchase only books you will be charged a 3.00 flat rate for shipping 1 book and 10 cents for each additional book.  So, if you purchased 10 books you would be charged 3.90 for shipping.  
If you purchase mixed items I will ship the least expensive way.----     
-------------------------------  COMBINED SHIPPING <----------------------------------
Shipping cost will be reduced when buying multiple items that are small & light weight.  To see total cost with actual shipping, mark the items you want as favorites, then message me with a request for actual shipping of your favorited items.  Or, list your items in a message, requesting ship cost.  I'll send you the cost & if you approve I'll make a reserved listing.  
Or, just buy the items in your cart.  I will do a refund for the ship overage as soon as I see your order.  (Don't want to message me?  I automatically check for ship overages, & will make a refund if applicable).

13060,Custom Engagement/ Wedding Scrapbook Album,"
            If your engagement photo shoot was anything like mine, you ended up with dozens upon dozens of photos you loved, but had no place to display them all! This is the perfect solution for those who love displaying their photos and don’t want to use just any boring album. 
The albums I create are not your stereotypical scrapbooks. In addition to individually matting each photo with cardstock, I use handmade and artisanal papers I find at stationary and bookbinding stores. I never use the typical patterned and themed papers you find at craft stores. I take special care to make each and every page classy and elegant!
The 350 price includes:
Cost of prints
Supplies (e.g., cardstock, fine papers, washi tape, embellishments, alphabet stickers, ribbons, etc.)
20 12”x12” pages (If you need more pages, I charge 15 per page over 20; for five or more extra pages, I charge 10 per page)
How the process works:
Let me know the color scheme you’d like
Pick out up to 50 photos. This averages to about 2.5 photos per page, which allows for a wide variety of layouts and photos per page. 
Just e-mail me the photos and I’ll take care of the rest (cropping, black and whites, printing)! 
I also do custom wedding scrapbooks so be sure to check out my other listing!        ",350.00,5.0,"Handmade item

14136,"Knitting needle case, Circular needle case, Needle Organizer, Crochet case","
            Needle case made of sturdy denim.
This is my version of the ""best of"" case.
You can put your favorite Needles, Circulars, DPNs, Crochets and everything you need to complete your projects.
It is made to last! Not only because of the strong fabric, but also because of the look. It is sophisticated enough to be proud of with the leather tab, but looks casual enough with the dark denim. It will last for years and will not go out of style because it has that classic look.
It's ideal to put your kit of interchangeable circular knitting needles.
On the bottom there is 12 spaces starting from small to large.
On the top pocket there is 5 larger spaces to accommodate circular needles, small scissors and has a leather strap that helps everything to stay in place. If you put DPNs in the case, the top pocket can hold needles up to 8"". They could also be in the bottom pocket and held by the top leather strap.
This case does NOT accommodate long straight needles it is 9.5"" high
If you are looking for a straight needle case: 
https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/290846483/knitting-needle-case-long-needle?ref=shop_home_listings
I have put a secret pocket to the left that is lined in a striped cotton and is closed with velcro. 
Your markers, finishing needles and other small parts will be safe in that pocket.
There is a top flap (11.25"" X 3.5"") that folds to keep your needles secure inside.
The whole case folds 3 times and is closed with velcro.
15"" width X 13"" high when open, including flaps.
4"" X 9.5"" when closed
- To make sure your needles don't fly out:
 don't put your needles randomly in the case, put them in the right slots so they are snug together. And when you close the case, don't just roll it, fold it in three like in the picture. 
Then, your precious needles will be safely kept. 
*Needles and everything shown in the pictures are not included.
**Your Needle case will be shipped flat and open to save money on shipping.
***The color of the Denim may slightly vary from the picture du to the availability of the fabric, 
but it will always be dark blue.
****The Blue Denim is NOT prewashed, it may bleed a little like new jeans. 
     Spot clean.It is not recommended to soak in water because of the leather.
*****This listing is for ONE case, the last picture is to show the difference between the two.        ",44.72,4.9809,"Handmade item

14210,"Samsonite Padded Camera Bag, Camera Case,  Vintage 1990","
            This is a black fabric, feels like nylon, padded camera case.  I wouldn’t consider this a large bag, although it is larger than the new “Samsonite Large Point and Shoot Camera Case” is saw on Amazon.  Yet it is still really small enough and light enough to be easily manageable.  The outside dimension is  about 7 x 7 inches, inside dimension 6 ½ x 6 ½. .  The large back compartment has a padded divider that can be removed to make the one large compartment, or attached to Velcro strips that run almost the whole width of the compartment to divide it into two compartments of almost any size you need. The zipper closing this large section of the case has a little collar that folds snugly down to hide the zipper, then both are covered by the large flap that attaches to a piece of Velcro; increasing the weather-proof qualities of the case. 
There is a front panel that unzips to fold out revealing a mesh pocket, 3 x 2 ½ inches, 4 elastic loops for holding whatever, and three small fabric pockets, with access from the side and elastic along the edge to keep whatever is inside secure.  One outside edge has an additional mesh pocket about 4 ½ inches deep and 2 ½ in wide.  The last of the four elastic loops has some loose stitching.  I believe it must have been a manufacturing defect because I’m quite sure I never used the loops for anything.  That is the only flaw I find. 
The adjustable, detachable shoulder strap is about 47 inches long when fully extended; it’s clean with no fraying.  There is a purse type handle firmly stitched to the top if you prefer to carry it that way, or you can attach it to your belt, backpack or even your golf cart via the strap on the back, stitched at the top and attached by Velcro at the bottom.  There is a small white tag sewn into an inside seam that may be a model #  PO:001392 FID40.        ",8.95,5.0,"Vintage item

***IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT MONOGRAMMING: I do not rearrange the letters! The initials you type in are exactly how it will be made. Some customers like the monogram in the traditional style (First, Last, Middle) and some like it as it is written (First, Middle, Last). It is a personal preference, so please type the letters exactly as YOU want them. If you tell me the full name is: Sara Jane Parker and type SJP, I will make the bag with the initials SJP. However, if you tel me the full name and type SPJ, that is how it will be made. Personalized items cannot be returned, so please type carefully.***
When you go to check out, scroll to the bottom and you will see a box where you can leave me a ""note to Just Get Pampered"". This is where you will give me that info. EXAMPLE: ""Font Girly Girl, Monogram ABC"" Remember that however you type the initials, is how it will be made, so put the letters in the order YOU want them sewn on the bag.

Animals and birds are a significant feature in Celtic and Norse mythology. Animals and birds were vital to everyday life and wellbeing and they feature in art, literature, rituals and religious beliefs. 
In Celtic mythology the Raven features in many legends. This large bird feeding as it does on carrion with its black plumage and disturbing deep hoarse croak is often viewed with some foreboding for it can be seen as an omen of death. It can also be associated as a source of power, straddling as it does the worlds of the living and the dead therefore often depicted as messenger between the two. Ravens hovering over the scenes of battle, ready to swoop down on the bodies of the fallen must have been a fearsome sight to Celtic warriors. Little wonder then that they could be seen as having the power of gods.        ",35.00,5.0,"Handmade item

17092,Bague pour homme argent sterling fait-main,"
            Men ring. I love rings on men. I love men who wears jewelry. I love cool jewelry on men! 
Sterling silver (925) ring is open at the front for an edgy look but still keeping low-profile!
This ring is slightly textured all around and the inside is brushed. Don't hesitate asking initiales to be written inside or a special date to remember or anything small you'd like!
***925 silver is the most common and good quality silver used for jewelry. Most people aren't allergic to silver and can be worn easily. Each jewelry comes in a beautiful wrapping, including a silver towel to freshen the jewelry once in a while. I recommend to keep your silver jewelry in a box, in a dry room. Avoid wearing natural pearls in shower and chlorine water. Natural pearls like fresh water and salt water! But they will last longer away from chemicals, perfume and scented cream!
As it is all hand made and hand cut, the average time to make an order is 2-3 weeks. BUT! I would be so happy to help you more if you need a jewelry in a short time or personalized!

Jonc pour homme.  J'adore les bagues sur les hommes. J'adore les hommes qui portent des bijoux. J'aime les bijoux sur les hommes!
Fait en argent sterling (925) le jonc est ouverte sur le dessus pour donner un 'edge' au simple jonc mais tout en gardant une simplicité! 
Le jonc a une texture légère tout autour et l'intérieur est fini à la brosse. N'hésitez pas à demander des initiales, une date importante à se rappeler inscrit à l'intérieur! 
***L'argent 925 est l'argent de qualité le plus utilisé pour les bijoux. La majorité des gens ne sont pas allergique à l'argent et l'argent se porte facilement. Chaque bijou est soigneusement enveloppé et vient avec une serviette pour nettoyer l'argent et les métaux précieux afin de rafraichir votre bijou de temps en temps. Je recommande de garder vos bijoux en argent sterling dans une boite, dans un endroit sec. Évitez de porter les perles naturelles dans la douche et dans l'eau chlorée. Les perles naturelles aiment l'eau douce et salée mais elles resteront belles plus longtemps éloigné des parfums, synthétiques et crèmes parfumées!
Elles sont entièrement fait à la main et le temps d'une commande est d'environ 2-3 semaines. MAIS! Je serais plus qu'heureuse de vous aider si vous avez besoin d'un bijou plus rapidement ou personnalisé.        ",122.14,5.0,"Handmade item

19972,Hot Pink Shorts with a Black Waistband - Spandex Dance Shorts Comfortable and Stylish. All Sizes Available,"
            Pink and Black...the color combination that is all the rage. These shorts go with any leotard or shirt, 
And of course, a dance top can be made to match, to make it into a complete outfit!!!
These shorts are a made from a light/medium weight 4-way stretch spandex, and cut from the famous Dance Mom's Dance Wear pattern that fits the way a dancer WANTS them to fit! 
Matching Sports Bra tops can be made to match these shorts!
The girls at our studio used to complain that the dance shorts they bought did not fit right! They were too long in the crotch, but when they folded down the waistband, they came up too high and gave them a ""wedgie!""
So I created this pattern...and the girls love it!
These shorts are made to fit comfortably just below the waist, and have a Spandex waistband with NO ELASTIC!!!!
_______________________________________________________________________
ABOUT DANCE MOM'S DANCE WEAR:
I am a Dance Mom.
Back when I was toting my kids back and forth to the studio, we didn't have a name for it, but that's what I was...a Dance Mom. In fact...I had 9 kids who danced! I was a Dance Mom Extraordinaire! 
When I was a dance mom, there was no ""Dance Moms"" television show. We didn't have a balcony to sit in, and we didn't yell and bicker.
When I was a dance mom, we sat on folding chairs outside the studio. We looked after our younger children and we exchanged recipes....and I became the official ""fixer of costumes,"" because the kids hated the way their dance wear fit!
They hated the elastic waistbands that pinched and pulled when they danced. They hated the ""baggy butt syndrome"" they got when they wore their dance shorts, and the ""wedgie"" they got when they turned down the waistband. 
Mostly, they generally disliked the fact that while all dancers are different, the costumes are made in ""cookie cutter"" fashion, with different SIZES, but not different ""FITS."" 
It is through this experience that I learned what dancers like, and how to fit different body types. I developed my special dance shorts pattern that is exclusive to this site, with a fit that is flattering for dancers from 3 years old to 30.
I learned how to make a ""washable tutu"" so that the little ones can play dress up without having to throw away their favorite tutu when it gets dirty.
And I learned that there is nothing to be gained by using cheap spandex. Quality is important to the way dance wear fits and holds up through the rigourous testing of a serious dancer.
At THIS dance mom's dance wear store, we care about how your dance wear fits, and that you get the quality that you deserve.
And if you happen to see an episode of that ""Dance Mom's"" show, and you see an outfit on one of the dancers that you would like to have made...let me know. I just LOVE those special orders!

            We take a pocket, deconstruct it, reformulate it, upgrade it some more, place it on a somewhat tailored short trouser, and we get mens shorts transformed, with pockets unequaled. 
In addition; we implemented a visible button fly closure, added architectural belt loops, and gave you a visible scar stitch on the back. Its taking a higher thing to a higher standard.
