            Leather Luggage Tag, Get Busy Living Or Get Busy Dying, Shawshank Redemption, Genuine Leather Luggage Tag, Wanderlust, Travel Gift
Made from beautiful vegetable tanned leather, my luggage tags are strong, durable, and designed to last for years to come.
Each one starts out as a piece of natural leather, which is then dyed, inked with the design and then embossed and waxed.  Each one is sealed on the back side so you can write your name or details with any indelible marker pen.  All edges are black and are also sealed.
Each 2in x 3.5in tag is finished with an antique brass eyelet and beautifully soft deerskin lace which is extremely strong, yet soft and supple. 
Personalization can not be added to these luggage tags.        ",16.58,5.0,"Handmade item

3840,"Rare Vintage 1940s French Powder Compact Complete With Lipstick,  Engraved & Engine Turned Base, Art Deco Compact","
            A beautiful large, solid brass compact, dating from 1940s. This compacts is in good, usable condition; it has some minor sign of wear, commensurate with its 70-plus years of age, but the mirror is clear and the hinges and clasps all work well. 
The lid is beautifully engraved with little fish with long fan-like tails swimming amongst sea plants. It is polished to a nice, subtle shine.
The base is engine turned and has only very minor signs of wear.
The compact opens by pressing a button on the side, revealing a self opening interior flap leading to the powder well. These 'nail saving' self opening lids were patented by Stratton in the 1940s and quickly adopted (and adapted) by other compact manufacturers. As soon as one opens the outer lid, the inner lid automatically pops open - no need to push buttons or slide levers and all those other nail breaking hazards! 
Inside the lipstick compartment here is a beautifully shaped lipstick holder with a bright red lipstick. Even the lipstick on its own, with its gracefully domed lid, is a lovely collectible item.

            This is a high quality sepia toned photograph taken by Greg Petrick  in the 70s in Lancaster Pa. Other sizes available. 
 ""Sam, the Peanut Man,"" was actually Savas Vulopas. He came to Lancaster from Greece in 1918. He was one of downtown Lancaster's ""characters.""  He and his brother, Stergos Voulopos (who went by ""Steve"" and spelled his surname differently), operated various food shops in downtown Lancaster until the early '30s.  In 1932, Stergos opened and began operating the Manhattan Peanut Stand at 50 W. King St.  Meanwhile, Sam moved to Ephrata, where he operated Superior Dry Cleaners for nearly four decades. He also sold peanuts in Ephrata.  After Stergos died in 1971, Sam moved back to Lancaster. He ran the shop on West King until the end of 1980. He roasted his last peanuts just after Christmas. He said he had been selling about 10 tons of peanuts a year.   He was 98 years old when he died in 1999.        ",12.00,5.0,"Vintage handmade item from the 1970s

The Merino breed is one of the world’s most ancient and toughest breeds of sheep.
Its fleece is built for extremes – breathable in summer, keeps you warm in winter, yet it is exceptionally soft and lightweight.
You have to try it, to truly understand how marvelous this exceptional wool feels!

16932,Ring Enhancer Wrap For Solitaire W/ Marquise CZ's In Heavily Plated 14kt Gold,"
            Model # 2686
The Solitaire center stone shown above is for illustration purposes only and is not included with this ring. It may be ordered starting at 29.95 and up.
This thickly plated 14Kt gold solitaire engagement ring with wrap is set with beautiful lab Russian Cubic Zirconia. The design is very attractive and practical. We cast these rings in our shop from the same exact molds as we make our solid gold rings from. The very same jewelers and setters make these rings, side by side with our solid gold rings that sell for thousands of dollars. Many customers order our rings along with the genuine article, for wear on vacations, at the beach or on a cruise. We sell all of these rings for a small fraction of the price of our solid gold rings. This ring is 14Kt gold plated in our shop to a thickness of 2.5 microns of 14Kt gold. That is 5 times the thickness of gold that is typically plated on regular ""heavy"" gold plated rings. It is the exact same thickness as gold vermeil jewelry, which can sell for thousands of dollars. This ring is guaranteed to wear well and not tarnish for one year.
Available in size 4-9 (1/2 & 1/4 sizes as well)
