673,"MAXALOONES Black Faux Denim, traditional  ""jeans gold"" colored top-stitched bum, jegging fabric, grow with me unisex","
            Maxaloones with the look of black jeans. Who could ask for more. Tired of all the cutesy prints? Looking for Maxaloones with that simple JEANS look? Well here they are. Pant body has bum circle inset with topstitching the same as traditional jeans. Topstitching color is that jean-gold color, and is double stitched on this particular style. When you throw on your jeans, put your little one in theirs too!!
Faux denim is a jegging type black cotton lycra blend. This is a light to medium weight, but not too light. Waistband and leg cuffs are made of black cotton lycra for stretch. As always all seams are 4-thread serged which means that there is an extra row of safety stitching. Then bum circle is top-stitched for even more durability. 
As always these Maxaloones are made by me, in Oklahoma, USA.
I am an approved and authorized seller.

I found this precious piece on the flea market at the stall of a mother and her daughter. The mother in her 70s could very well remember how she got the scooter for her daughter in 1973. Both were beaming at me telling about the birthday surprise back then. 
The scooter is made of metal and has rubber wheels and handles. It is painted red and has a logo on the front that has faded. 
The scooter is not sold as an actual toy for children but for display purposes.

6071,Copper Bone Dog Tag for Dogs - Personalized Dog Tag - Pet ID Tag - Dog Name Tag - Custom Dog Collar Tag - Puppy Tag - Metal Pet Tag - Buster,"
            This adorable bone-shaped dog tag is sure to get your pet noticed!  The tag is made of solid copper, which makes it very sturdy but still light enough for medium and large dogs.  The ID tag measures about 1.25 inches long and 1 inch wide at its widest point.  For scale, this pet ID is slightly smaller than two U.S. quarters lined up next to each other.  
Each tag will be customized with your pet's name and phone number.  I can use the large font (as shown in the photos) for names up to 7 characters only!  If your pet has a longer name, I can make the tag with a smaller font.  The name will then be about the same size as the phone number.
Please note: This tag can only be stamped on the front side. I cannot put the phone number on the back of the tag. Because stamping is deeper than engraving, stamping on the back side will show through and mar the front of the tag. 
After your tag has been personalized, I give it a brushed antique finish and then seal it with a durable clear sealant to slow down the aging of the copper.  Two stainless steel heavy-duty split rings come installed, so it will be ready for your pet to wear right away.
I hand stamp each piece a single letter at a time, which makes each tag absolutely unique.  Stamping is much deeper than engraving.  This is great for pet tags because these tags will remain readable even after crazy puppy antics.
**IMPORTANT ORDERING INFORMATION**
In the ""Notes to Seller"" section, please be sure to include:
1) Your pet's name (limit 7 characters for the large font and 12 characters for smaller font)
2) Phone number you would like on the tag
Please note:  Due to differences in computer monitors and phone screens, the color of your pet tag may appear slightly different in the picture than the tag you receive.  The tag is made of copper and is a copper color and then is given an antique finish, which slightly darkens it.

6309,Sample Pack Catnip Cat Toys - All Proceeds Donated,"
            This is a sample pack of my different catnip cat toys.  I started out years ago by making small toys ( about 1.5"" in diameter), with bells and ribbon.  Then I found that my cats were losing these toys under the appliances and furniture.   Enter the larger size toys (about 2.5"" in diameter), with bells and ribbon.  Some of my repeat customers have mentioned they would like toys without bells/ribbon.  Their nocturnal playing cats have batted toys around the house, causing hours of lost sleep for their owners!  hee hee.  Ok, so then I started making the larger toys with no bells and ribbon.  The next item I designed is using baby alpaca yarn, which is one of the softest things on earth - and created a larger toy, (approximately 3"" in diameter).  Finally, I thought about the ultimate cat toy - a crocheted ball filled with nothing but catnip!
With this order, you get one of each: a small toy with NO BELL OR RIBBON; a large toy with NO BELL OR RIBBON; a large toy WITH BELL AND RIBBON; a large baby alpaca toy; and a toy with nothing but catnip. Please allow me to choose colors for you.

A testimonial from Jonathan in The Netherlands:
""Here is a testimonial to the popularity of the new cat toys, although seeing the action live in real-time is of course hilarious and impossible to capture on film.
Flynn managed to tear open the plastic bag they came in before I could open it myself, so I double-bagged them in large ziplock bags but then foolishly left it on an open shelf. Next morning he'd gnawed through both layers and had made off with a fresh ball. (What did you put in those things?)!""
A testimonial from Tina in Florida:
""I have 6 cats and my mom purchased some of your catnip toys for me in March. I just bought 8 more. These are the most amazing toys I have ever gotten for my cats. Even my 12 year old was playing like a kitten with them! My youngest, and largest kitten, just tore a hole in the last one. They love them. Thank you for making these amazing toys, I've been telling everyone about them. I even gave the Vet I work for and some of the other technicians some and they were amazed! Dr. Rosenburg said his old cat NEVER touches toys and she was sleeping with it.""
A testimonial from Marianne in Norway:
""Oh dear, did I just drug my cat? My sedate 8 y/o who normally just sleeps and eats all day is freaking out, purring, growling, licking and kicking his new toys. :D""
A testimonial from Christie in New York:
""I received my catnip toy order today! (thanks for the fast shipping) They are the BOMB! My cats were all over the package when I brought it in from the mail before I even opened it. I was going to give the toys to them for Christmas, but when they were so interested in the packaging I couldn't help myself. All three of them are running around with their own catnip ball having a grand old time. Best catnip toys EVER! I will definitely be recommending them to my friends and I will be back for more in the future!""
A testimonial from Monserrate in Chicago:
""I wanted to thank you! I've purchased my 8yr old cat so many toys over the years and like kids after the initial acknowledgment the toys go ignored. Not these! She runs around the house tossing it up in the air and chasing after it! I've never seen her so active!! Thank you!""
A testimonial from Craig in Manitoba, Canada:
""Buddy absolutely loves your toys; he responds to them better than anything else. He will look at the toy and suddenly pounce on it, attacking it, or he will move it a bit back and forth, making believe it's alive and then having it dart back and forth between his paws across the room. His favourite activity is to have us throw them and he chase after them. He will either bring it back or, more to his enjoyment, have us toss it across the room again. He will sometimes run and grab one and then, in his teeth, take it, with him being chased, or drop it and have us find it. ""

Magic in a jar! This diaper cream is gently infused with whole organic botanicals that soothe inflammation, clear diaper rash and heal baby's sensitive skin. It is hand blended with Zinc Oxide powder to lock out moisture, allowing the skin underneath to heal. This cream can combat even the worst of rashes!
This product is great for babes who have sensitive skin.  We choose to use whole herbs to soothe the skin instead of essential oils in our diaper cream.  Essential oils are very concentrated and not safe for regular use on such a sensitive area.

I hope you find something that you and your little princess will love!  I offer small and large flowers for infants and older children.  If you are interested in a larger or smaller flower, please let me know and I can make the appropriate size for you.

6622,Nylon Headbands TAN NUDE Nylon Headband WHOLESALE Baby Headband Nylon Headbands Wholesale Nylon Elastic Baby Bulk Soft Thin Supply Deluxe,"
            ●LOW COST SAMPLES: Not sure of the size or color? For only 3 (includes shipping), try a sample pack of any 6 bands of your choice.  Click this listing: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/400207407
 . Sample packs only have free shipping to USA and Canada. Add 2.99 shipping fee to all other countries.
●ONE SIZE FITS MOST: Nylon bands have good stretch & elasticity. Will fit newborns, toddlers, older kids, and even adults, although for adults it may be a tight fit.
●HIGH QUALITY: Perfect thickness and width. Stretches to fit newborns to adults. Run-resistant so bands can take lots of streching force. Snag resistant and smooth, so nails don't pull out fibers. Non-rolling material is stiff enough to keep its shape and not unroll. This makes working with the bands easier, and also stays on baby's head nicely.
●100% MADE IN USA!!! The thread and material are manufactured in USA! Then we cut and stretch the bands by hand in NY, USA.
●FAST TURN-AROUND TIME: Order by midnight today, and your order typically ships by tomorrow, Monday-Friday. Want us to rush your order and ship it same day? Message us or leave a note saying ""RUSH"" :)
●NEW CUSTOMER SPECIAL: get 10% off your first order. Message me for a coupon.
●FREE SHIPPING: on USA orders of 30 or more! use coupon code ""FreeShip""
●FLAT RATE SHIPPING: Ship prices do not depend on quantity. Ship prices are 3.49 USA / 10.49 Canada / 15.49 international.
●10,000 PIECES IN STOCK NOW!!! available for next-day shipment. (updated March, 2017).
●COLOR: Suntan nude. These bands have more color than your typical pale nude bands. Color may be considered a little darker or has a hint of orange, and is more similar to a caramel color. This color matches hair better than pale nude in many cases. See photo for actual color.
●MINIMUM-MARKING: Nylon bands are gentle on babies head and leave minimal sign of indentation after wearing. Some babies with less hair and sensitive skin can show signs of marking, so we do NOT guarantee no marks or indents. If you see marking or want a looser fit, try over-stretching the bands. Also, you can ask us about trying our XL bands, which we will start selling in 2017.
●MATERIAL: Made of nylon/spandex composite fabric. Very soft and smooth. Our material has a different texture than any supplier we know. If unsure about our bands, please order a sample using our sample listing. 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/400207407
●SIZE, CIRCUMFERENCE: Bands stretch from 8"" to 24"" circumference. These fit newborns through teens comfortably. Adults who prefer a tighter fit can use these too.
●THICKNESS: Bands are ~1/4 inches thick (~6 mm). These are the “thin” or “skinny” style headbands. Yet thick enough to attach well to flowers and various materials well.
●BULK DISCOUNT: Increasing bulk savings per headband. The more you buy, the more you save per headband!
●SIZE VARIABILITY: Since the bands are hand made, and material we receive can vary slightly, there may be some slight variation in band size and thickness. But, you will find that we have the most consistent sized bands of any seller. The size will still be perfect for babies and kids of all ages.
●BEST PRICE GUARANTEE: If another MAJOR nylon band supplier on Etsy has a lower price (including shipping) for the quantity of bands you want to buy, message me with the shop name & quantity, OR screenshot your cart. I will price match the seller if I can!  This guarantee is for USA shipping addresses only.        ",0.28,4.995,"Handmade Supply

            My handmade satin rose petals are perfect for:
Weddings
Bridal Showers
Baby Showers
Special Occasions
Home Decor
 
Each petal is hand-cut and designed by me personally.  No two petals are alike, they all have different curls and curves to them.  I use high-quality bridal satin fabric and the ends are sealed to prevent fraying.
****************************************************************************
The satin petals start at 100 in a set.  All pricing for the petals are located in the drop-down Pricing Menu.  The petals measure between 1 1/2 inches to 2 1/2 inches.  
Do not see the color combination you want?  I love custom orders and would love to create the perfect color combination for you!
****************************************************************************
Unsure of how many petals you need?  Here is a Guideline that I suggest:
*Flower Girls:  	about 100 to 200 per basket
*Petal Toss: 		about 25 petals per guest
*Reception Tables: 	25 to 100 petals per table
*Aisles: 	Light sprinkle:        25 petals per square foot
		Moderate sprinkle: 50 petals per square foot
		Dense coverage:  100 petals per square foot
		Aisle Borders:       200 petals per square foot

Once your package is at the Post Office, I have no control over it.

***NOTE:  I offer samples so you can make sure that it is the exact color that you would like.  I do not offer returns, because the petals are made especially for you!***

            Harambe Devotional Prayer Saint Candle
Tall white altar/ prayer candle featuring the Patron Saint of life itself.
The image is photoshopped then printed and pasted to a traditional ""7 day"" white altar candle. Placement may vary slightly as these are hand-cut and placed. Blue, Yellow, green and red candles also available, but may take additional time. 
Please exercise caution when handling the candles and in general keep them in moderate conditions. While sturdy, ultimately these are art prints and are not able to withstand moist hot conditions.
Due to the heaviness of the glass, shipping is slightly more for candles. Etsy automatically calculates shipping.

            Honeysuckle Perfume Oil vegan roll on fragrance floral flower spring summer classic fresh feminine
Warm, sunny, sweet and golden... the scent of honeysuckle flowers on their green vines, each tendril dripping with golden blossoms full of nectar. A bestseller! Please note: honeysuckle is a flower. Honeysuckle scent does not contain honey! Honeysuckle flowers are named for the sweet taste of their nectar. Please don't order this thinking it's going to smell like honey. 
My perfume oils are well-scented, as they are blended to contain about 30-33% fragrance compound. This results in a true scent with staying power. However, my perfumes are not meant to be overpowering; they tend to wear closely... it will be enjoyed by you and those that you are close to, and will not broadcast your presence in a room. 
Packaged in a portable, petite glass bottle with black roll-on and cap... about .33 ounces (10ml). Perfect for your pocket, purse, desk drawer, or bureau.
Fractionated coconut oil is the carrier oil in this perfume, so the feel will be non-greasy and light when you put it on.

8907,"Kokomo Cream Natural Deodorant - Handmade Creamy, Dreamy Tropical Organic- 4.75 oz With Recipe","
            Crunchy Betty's Natural Market BEST SELLER!
Take yer pits on a fresh, dreamy tropical vacation from stink every day of the year!
I formulated Kokomo Cream handmade deodorant with ingredients that will help protect you from odor, while you remain fresh as a breeze all day long.
All 4.75 oz of deodorant cream (which is at least twice as much product as a store-bought deodorant) contains specialized ingredients like neem oil (antibacterial and healing), lime essential oil (deodorizing, refreshing, and antibacterial), tea tree oil (deodorizing and antibacterial), and coconut oil (nourishing and highly antibacterial), as well as other excellent ingredients you'd expect to find in a high-quality handmade deodorant cream.
And, as always, with your order of a full-size product from Crunchy Betty's Natural Market, you'll receive the exact recipe I used to create your yummy goods. This way, you can recreate it at home (and reuse the amber glass container, even!) if you'd prefer to try your hand at crafting your own body products.
Note: This is not an antiperspirant (your body was naturally designed to sweat - stopping that process is a no-no). 
Unlike many other homemade deodorants, this contains arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch, which is less potentially irritating - and you know it's not GMO!
INGREDIENTS: Cold pressed organic coconut oil, arrowroot powder, naturally procured (mined instead of chemically created) baking soda, neem oil, mango butter, lime essential oil, tea tree essential oil, sweet orange essential oil, and a small amount of beeswax to help your cream retain its consistency.
---
SPECIAL NOTE ON HANDMADE DEODORANT: 
First, it's very important to give your body a small amount of time (at least a week or two) to adjust from using commercially produced deodorant to natural deodorant. During this time, you may experience some irritation as your body adjusts and releases the synthetic chemicals it is accustomed to.
(This period is WORTH IT if you stick it out - nothing feels better than knowing you're avoiding the iffy ingredients in store-bought deodorant.)
However, a small percentage of people are unable to adjust to using baking soda under their arms. If an itchy irritation persists, discontinue use of this deodorant.
This handmade deodorant has a shelf life of at least 8-10 months.
---
IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE SUMMER: During warmer months, your Kokomo Cream may melt and separate a little. This is totally okay, and the deodorant is still in perfect working shape. All you have to do is give it a good stir to combine before using. (Personally, I prefer it this way, because it goes on extra super silky smooth.) In addition, it is highly likely that, after sitting in a hot delivery truck all day, it will reach you in this melty state. If you want to reset and harden it, just give it a good stir and leave it (closed tightly) in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.
--
FEATURED ON CRUNCHY BETTY:
Kokomo Cream handmade deodorant is entirely based on the deodorant I use, and was inspired by my very first experiment with homemade deodorant (which is still my very favorite deodorant ever). 
You can read more about the process here:
http://www.crunchybetty.com/all-roads-lead-to-the-pits-homemade-deodorant
http://www.crunchybetty.com/all-roads-lead-to-the-pits-the-homemade-deodorant-conclusion
There's a recipe there if you want to try it yourself, or buy the Kokomo Cream to find out if you like handmade deodorant first - and then make it yourself when you're out! 
---
THIS LISTING: Is for 4.75 oz of handmade Kokomo Cream deodorant, which should be enough to last at least two months or more, in an amber glass container (p.s. never put essential oils in plastic containers), as well as the recipe for Kokomo Cream deodorant.

            Deodorant Cream
Got that “wha, wha” feeling every time you buy natural deodorants? We all want to switch our chemical laden products but don’t necessarily want to be stinker for it!
This Deodorant is for the full spectrum of stinky. The coconut oil and aluminum FREE baking soda base are a bacteria checking dynamic duo. Mixed with the moisture absorbing properties of arrowroot and the antimicrobial properties of the essential oils, you and your pits will never be happier! The scent starts with a lovely harmony of black pepper, bergamot and a hint of citrus with a base of clary sage. The scent is light enough that it won’t compete with another fragrance. A word to all my black clothes loving people: this deodorant won’t leave those chalky white streaks that make you look like you’ve had a mime in a headlock.
Put a little on the tips of your fingers and apply. A little goes a long way, 2 oz will last you months and months and months and months.

Made out of solid cherry wood. Handmade in Pennsylvania from local, sustainably harvested cherry wood. Due to the handmade and natural nature of my work, the wood grain of the comb you receive will likely vary slightly from the wood grain of the comb(s) in the pictures. 
The wood is treated with food safe mineral oil, the same oil you'll find on wooden cutting boards. It is not stained or sealed with plastic. Re-oil as you wish to keep the wood soft and cared for. A coconut/beeswax blend is recommended, however mineral oil is fine too!

9016,"Coconut Milk Body Cream, Body Butter, Milk Body Lotion, Choose Scents","
            / / W H A T  I T  IS
Moisturizing body cream made with coconut milk. Made with natural ingredients with no animal products (vegan). For those who crave for body cream featuring a creamy addition of milk but do not want to use animal products, this is great for you. The consistency is very thick, creamy, and spreadable. Absorbs very quickly without leaving behind an oily residue. I just can't keep my fingers out of the jar! Available in different scents.
COCONUT MILK:
Thought to improve skin elasticity due to its copper and vitamin C content. Copper and vitamin C slows down the aging process of your skin by maintaining flexibility of the skin and its blood vessels. Coconut milk is a great moisturizer. In turn, it helps soothe irritated skin, dermatitis, and rashes. The proteins in coconut milk is not only great for skin, it is great for moisturizing and strengthening hair as well.
WHEAT GERM OIL:
Wheat-germ oil delivers a healthy infusion of vitamin A, vitamin D, B vitamins, antioxidants and fatty acids. It protects the skin from the harmful free radicals in the environment and slows the aging process. In turn, it is believed to improve wrinkles and overall skin appearance.
SWEET ALMOND OIL:
Rich in Vitamin E, monounsaturated fatty acids, proteins, potassium and zinc. Very light weight oil that soaks into the skin flawlessly without the sticky, oily feel. One of the most versatile oils used in skin care.
AVOCADO OIL:
Derived from avocado fruit. Great penetrating ability without the greasy feel on the skin. Contains monounsaturated fatty acids to nourish the skin barrier and an ample amount of Vitamin E, C, K and B6, folate, potassium and fiber.

9019,Organic Acne Fighting Facial Serum - Acne Treatment - Organic Acne Serum - Organic Face Oil - Vegan Face Oil,"
            ""Wait a second, wait a second, WAIT A SECOND. You want me to put OIL on my acne-prone skin?!?!""
In all likelihood, that's the question you just screamed at me into your computer screen. Thankfully, the technology to transfer that scream from your computer to mine hasn't been invented yet (please, gods of tech, let it never be). So, since you're likely sitting there wondering what the actual *ahem* I'm thinking, let me explain. 
Forget everything you know. Oil is GOOD for you. You should consider cleaning your face with it, and then slapping some more on once you've rinsed that lot off. 
*ducks flying shoe*
No seriously, I mean it! Go ahead and look up ""the oil cleansing method"" and let your mind be blown. In short: acne is a complicated condition which can involve food allergies, hormones, skin irritants, lack of proper hydration…you get the gist. It's a long list. While it's sometimes unclear what may be causing your acne, what is clear is that most mass-produced facial cleansers contain harsh, toxic ingredients that strip the skin of the natural oil (sebum) it secretes to keep itself moisturized and protected. So what does your skin do in response? Freaks out and produces more oil to replace what's been stolen away, leading to greasy looking skin, more clogged pores, and a continuation of a vicious cycle.
Then you have the store-bought lotions that follow these cleansers. When you get right down to it, they're nothing but oil (likely mineral oil or animal fats - which your skin is less likely to recognize and absorb), alcohol, water, and a slew of chemical emulsifiers and preservatives meant to blend all of that together and extend its shelf-life to some unnatural (and frankly terrifying) number of years. 
By cleansing your skin with oil, you're adhering to one of the basic principles of chemistry: like dissolves like. By moisturizing with naturally-derived plant-based oil, you're skipping over all those chemical additives and getting straight to the point of it all - MOISTURIZING YOUR SKIN.
This recipe contains the following: 
Organic Cold-Pressed Jojoba Oil: Widely considered to be the oil (or wax, since it technically is one) that most closely resembles sebum. Because of this, it's absorbed more easily than any other carrier oil and won't clog up your pores.
Organic Cold-Pressed Grape Seed Oil: Rich in linoleic acid, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, this oil is perfect for combating some causes of acne and wonderful for treating that which may already have formed. 
Organic Cold-Pressed Neem Oil: Antibacterial, antifungal, antihistamine, need I say more? Okay, I will. This oil has been used in traditional Ayurvedic practices to treat acne for centuries. 
Organic Steam Distilled Lavender, Rosemary, and Tea Tree Essential Oils: Because of lavender's antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, it helps to prevent the bacteria buildups that can lead to breakouts. Paired with the antimicrobial and antiseptic qualities of Rosemary Essential Oil and the antibacterial powerhouse that is Tea Tree Essential oil, this blend is ideal for treating acne and helping to prevent scars from forming once it retreats.
Use with our Acne Fighting Face Mask and Acne Fighting Facial Toner to really kick those breakouts to the curb:

                                                                                                     **A FEW NOTES**
- A little goes a long way with this serum. To use, dispense a small dollop onto the palm of your hand both morning and night and rub into clean skin, avoiding mouth and eye areas. No one knows your skin like you do, so this use description is more of a ""suggestion"". A starting point, if you will. If you feel that your skin is still a little dry after application, simply add more oil. Easy as that! 
- The neem oil used in this product contains naturally occurring particulates which haven't been filtered out because I believe it's more beneficial to the finalized product to leave them in. So be aware that upon use there might be some plant matter in your glass dropper. It should also be noted that neem oil has an odor that not everyone will find pleasant, and this scent is not entirely masked by the essential oils used this recipe. 
- Those pregnant or breastfeeding should not use this blend, as the side effects of many essential oils are not fully known due to lack of clinical testing. 
- This is an all-natural product made with sterilized equipment and no natural or chemical preservatives. For best results, store in a cool, dark place (a bathroom cabinet works perfectly) and use within six months of purchase. Clean, dry fingers or an organic, unbleached cotton ball are best to apply this serum. The glass of the dropper should not touch your skin and should be placed directly back into the glass jar after use, as adding dirt or water to any preservative-free beauty product could introduce some yucky bacteria into the mix. 
PRO TIP: if a natural product looks or smells off, discontinue use.

9046,"Scar Salve, Scar healing balm - for old body scars and for face","
            This salve is comprised of herbal infusions of wild rose hips and comfrey in castor oil. Here are some of the reasons why I chose castor oil as a main component of this salve:
Castor oil stimulates lymphocytes in the body. Lymphocytes speed and enhance the healing process. This accelerates the healing of acne wounds and scars.
The oil hydrates, softens, and regenerates skin - it is a ""dry"" oil and does not clog pores, thus it is very safe to use on your face for acne scars. Castor oil is also anti-inflammatory and thus will soothe any inflammation caused by blemishes or acne.
I gather wild rose hips in Autumn and crush them with a mortar and pestle so that the vital oils in the seeds are usable. Rose hip seeds have one of the highest sources of vitamin e of any plant, and vitamin e stimulates the formation of collagen on the skin, making it one of the best additions in a salve for scar healing. 
Other ingredients in this salve are: cacao butter, shea butter, tamanu oil, rose hip seed oil, and therapeutic essential oil blend. The essential oils of neroli, lavender, and cedarwood were specifically chosen for their skin regenerative benefits.
This listing is for a 4ounce glass jar of salve. Any questions, feel free to ask me.        ",12.00,4.9252,"Handmade item

9076,Farewell Fungus Salve,"
            Yo, I love to talk about foot fungus. The more I learn about bacteria and fungi, the more I weirdly admire them. Like plants and animals, they are the other creatures populating the heck out of the world out there! 
Bacteria and fungi have had dynamic relationships with medicinal plants for, like, millions of years. When we use plants as medicine, our bodies get to be the stadium of this ancient game. The ‘antiseptic’ and ‘anti-fungal’ properties of plants we apply in herbal medicine are borrowed from the plant’s own ability to keep bacteria and fungus at bay. 
Let me just take a moment to thank the medicine plants for letting me borrow some of their stuff- I will totally return that phone charger asap btw.
Foot fungus is an especially stubborn variety- in a way similar to a dude who won’t move out of his parents house. You know, I’ll just chill way down here between your toes/basement. Why would I leave? You got the space and you feed me regular meals. Years go by. Oh yeah, still totally down there.
Well, Fat and the Moon has an herbal smackdown/life coach squad here to help you get your basement back so you can finally put your pinball machine down there. 
Herbs like black walnut, chaparral, thuja and usnea ain’t fooled by the fungus’ empty promises of flight from feet! 
To compare and contrast for a moment with the Healing Foot Powder… in a salve, the herbs are infused in oil making the product especially good for the dry and itchy variety of fungus- Athlete's foot being at the top of that list. The oil soothes the dry and cracking parts of the skin while delivering the kick in the pants to the offending fungi. The Foot Powder is great for the fungus that loves the sweaty scene, since the powder absorbs moisture. They can be used in tandem if you have some 'all seasons' fungus that just won’t quit..
The Farewell Fungus Salve can also be used for fungus on other parts of the bod and would be great for stinkers like ringworm. Don’t even get me started on ringworm…..

10339,Baby toy wood teether baby toys natural teething phone,"
            These wood toy teether phones were created to help save your real phone from babies.  Babies love to chew technology. This isn't really great for babies and it isn't really good for technology either.   So here is a faux phone toy engraved with cute little animals and shapes :) 
Personalization details:
Please let me know:
1. Name
2. Font style 
3. Orientation
* If none are chosen at time of purchase defaults as shown in picture 2 will be used.  (Helvetica and orientation 2.
Why faux tech?
One day while testing a brand new Blackberry (for a top executive at the office no less), I allowed my teething daughter to play with it for a few minutes to occupy her while I was driving. After retrieving it from her, I groaned when I noticed little teeth marks marring the finish. Even worse, her drool had caused the keys to stop functioning properly. I guess the old models WERE tougher!
Inspired by loss of the phone, here is the all-natural iphone for babies and toddlers! This toy is chemical and toxin-free! It's laser engraved on Canadian maple and finished with a baby safe unscented beeswax polish (unrefined beeswax, olive oil, carnauba wax). I guarantee this keepsake will outlive any other smartphone on the market!! It measures 6cm x 11cm.
Please note that this is a handmade natural wood product, and as such may have minor variations in the color and grain patterns in the wood.
If you want different dimension please convo me and I will set up a custom order.

11705,Stargazing at Noon - Poetry Chapbook by Amanda Torroni - 38 pages,"
            ""Stargazing at Noon by Amanda Torroni is charged with flickering, unapologetic undercurrents. The primitive, dreamlike consistency offers a lucid depth that's both relatable and other-worldly. She talks up close about the distance between us. She writes at the edge of things in a lyrical, unobstructed way that's both inventive and nostalgic. The dizzying pace and acute awareness reminds me of a meteor shower itself--a rare sensory experience, breath-catching and unforgettable. I was free-falling through these pages. They'll make anyone wish they understood the mysteries of the past, the ever-expanding universe, the human condition as well as she does."" -Review by Megan Magers
""Stargazing at Noon"" is Amanda Torroni's first poetry chapbook, featuring 30 of her best poems from the last year.  Book size is 6""x9"".  Cover art by Kathleen Rule.  40 pages.

12596,"HELENA  Black guipiere lace kimono - getting ready bridal kimono, valentines day, lingerie, trousseau, honeymoon, Valentine's Day gift","
            Hello!
I’m Anna, and I’m a designer and dressmaker based in Worthing, near Brighton. I design and make every garment here in my studio at the seaside for my bridal wear label; ‘This Modern Love’. 
The aesthetic for ‘This Modern Love’ is romantic, feminine, bohemian and beautifully simple garments, all hand crafted using the finest materials such as silk chiffon, corded lace, duchess satin and soft tulle.
❤️ HELENA - Guipiere lace kimono - Lingerie ❤️
Made with 100% soft guipiere lace in black with a black satin ribbon tied at the waist.
Model wears a black bodysuit with the kimono - the kimono is a sheer/see through design with a floral, embroidered motif all over . 
Loose fit sleeves and pretty scalloped detailing at the hem, plus a pretty grosgrain ribbon to tie the kimono. Ribbon available in champagne or black - whichever you prefer.
The standard size fits most and is approximately 35 inches from shoulder to hem. The sleeves are 11 inches wide. This can be made in any size, please let me know your bust waist, hips measurement & desired length if you would like a different size to the standard.
How does ordering work?
This kimono is handmade to order, in any size. The standard size (pictured on the model who is a sz 8/10 and 5ft 11 tall) fits most, but if you have special requirements, tall or petite etc just let me know.
That’s it! Your lace kimono will be shipped to you within 2 weeks and I’ll let you know when it’s on it’s way - you can follow my social media accounts for updates on what I’m working on.
Can I visit you?
Yes! You’re very welcome to visit my home studio to try on the range of sample dresses and view the fabric sample books and range of laces available in person. Please contact me to make an appointment. 
If you’re unable to visit me then you’re welcome to order online! I can answer any questions you have and discuss your design ideas with you over email.
Made to order
Please bear in mind that the kimonos are made to order and for that reason are non returnable and non refundable. I offer a free fitting on every garment, so that if you find it needs a minor alteration to be ‘fitted’ (i.e. taken in) then this service is provided free of charge. I’m afraid that I cannot alter a dress to be made larger or longer where incorrect measurements have been provided. If you’re unsure about how to take your measurements please do get in touch and I’m happy to help.
Like to know more?
You can read more about my designs, highlights, background, FAQs and testimonials from real brides on my website & take a look at my portfolio of work on my social media too on Wordpress, Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram & Twitter.

13712,Lucky Six Pence Wedding Bouquet Charm Personalized Blue Swarovski Crystal - Engagement - Gift - Something Blue - Something Old - Engraved,"
            ""Something old, something new,
Something borrowed, something blue,
and a silver sixpence in her shoe.""
The perfect lucky charm on your wedding day! A personalized authentic British six pence bouquet charm with a blue Swarovski crystal.
Use the dropdown menu to choose the combination you'd like:
OPTION 1: Six Pence coin and Swarovski crystal only (see third picture in the listing)
OPTION 2: Six Pence coin and personalized name disc (see second picture in the listing)
OPTION 3: Six Pence coin, personalized name disc, and Swarovski crystal (see first picture in the listing) 
If ordering a piece with the stainless steel personalized name disc, please include the names (or date, if you prefer no names) to be stamped on the outer edge in the special instruction/note to seller box during checkout.  The maximum character space is around 16-18 characters before the coin overlays the writing. Please know that requesting more than 18 characters may result in some of the writing being partially covered by the Six Pence. 
If ordering a piece with the Swarovski crystal, the aqua blue (March) crystal will be used as a default. The ""Timothy & Leslie) example is shown with a sapphire (September) crystal. Want to change the color? Please refer to the Swarovski crystal color chart on this listing and include the color crystal in the special instructions/note to seller box during checkout. 
This is an authentic British Sixpence with Elizabeth II on the reverse side of the coin. Each Six Pence comes with a blue Swarovski crystal on a white ribbon to tie to your bouquet. **I only carry white ribbon in stock. You can easily remove and replace the ribbon included with the color of your choice once you receive your bouquet charm.** Or remove the coin and crystal from the ribbon to place the coin in the bride's left shoe for good luck.
Each coin and crystal are attached by a silver stainless steel jump ring and can easily be converted to a keepsake necklace or bracelet after the wedding day. The disc is a 1"" stainless steel round pendant.  Perfect for the bride or a bridesmaids gift. 
The dates range on the coins in this listing. Most are from the 1950's to 1960's and are in good, but circulated condition. We do not polish the coins to look new. Each coin has been on a journey, and we do not wish to remove the character and luck each coin has experienced. 
WHY WE DON'T PERSONALIZE THE BACK...all of our items are hand stamped using a hammer and a metal punch to make an impression in the metal. This can sometimes leave a slight smudge mark on the reverse. For this reason, we never recommend stamping on the front and the back of an item. 
This item is ~hand made.~ Our studio has these pieces punched by a local metal company, and we hand stamp all of the lettering in our studio. Each letter is hand aligned and punched into the metal, so the placement of the wording will vary slightly from piece to piece. 
Please check our Shop Announcement for current processing times. We strive to ship personalized items as quickly as possible (usually 1-3 business days). **Processing times may change during holidays (Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Thanksgiving - Christmas holiday season.**
**Shipping: ~Please read our shipping policy carefully.~ First Class mail is the slowest delivery and least expensive. Priority mail is faster and a little more expensive. Both shipping options are available during checkout for delivery inside the United States. International shipping is unpredictable, and once the package leaves the United States - I can not see the tracking information or give you updates. All tracking numbers for domestic and international orders are uploaded to your purchases page once your item is shipped. You can estimate shipping time to your area on the USPS website.

14001,"WEFTY fabric weaving needle set of two: 1"" and 1/2""","
            WEFTY listing has been updated to reflect increase in shipping rates. 
The only needle specially designed for weaving fabric strips and bias tape, invented by a weaver. 
The WEFTY fabric weaving needle is 5.5"" long and comes in a set of two. One is 1"" wide for use with 1"" fabric strips, and the other is 1/2"" wide for use with 1/2"" fabric strips.*
The WEFTY has a tab at the end for looping the end of the strip (much like the eye of a needle), securing it in place as you weave. It's flat construct ensures that the WEFTY will glide through your project without disturbing the design - all while holding and pulling the fabric strip tucked neatly behind it. The grooves on the top allow you to choose how to move it through your project: You may grip the WEFTY by the sides, or push it from the top using just your finger.
Quilt shops and retailers: DM for wholesale order information, please.
Customers outside of the United States: please DM me for information about my (way) less expensive shipping option.
Made of plastic.
*When prepping fabric strips to weave, I fold the sides into the middle and press. This is how I come up with the dimensions of the fabric-to-needle fit.        ",12.00,4.993,"Primary color: Lime (green)

*****INTERNATIONAL ORDERS are sent without tracking to keep rates down for you.  Your rate includes up to 7 sets of labels, any more - please contact us for a special listing.****
FAQ LIST HERE:  https://theheartofwonder.patternbyetsy.com/about
Your order details may be typed in the NOTES to SELLER section during checkout.  =) 
You've asked often, here they are for 2017.  Printed, cut, paper backing removed and ready-to-go.  Pre-cut Teeny-Tiny branding labels are made with 100% cotton, are completely washable and colorfast as well as fray-proof. These labels are heat sealed and can be ironed in and/or sewn in.  Labels measure 1/2 "" high x  1.75 "" wide.    There are TWO fabric choices: White Cotton and Cotton Muslin, please see photo #4. Labels are soft and flexible, nothing scratchy.  Proofs are sent upon request via Etsy convo after payment. Order specifics may be typed in the Note to Seller section at checkout or sent via Etsy message. 
IRONING IN:  
We use Heat n Bond, an ultrahold, permanent fabric adhesive.  Your labels will have this flexible, rubbery backing.  If you're not sewing the labels in, ironing instead, they need only a brief touch with a hot, dry iron to stay in place.  Allow them to cool.  Do not take repeat passes with the iron.  The backing is a permanent fabric adhesive that will last through many washes.  When ironed in properly, the labels will stay in for a long time without sewing. Over time a corner may curl a bit, but this is the normal wear-and-tear process in exchange for the no-sew convenience. 
SEWING IN:  
The bonded backing on the labels will pass through under a sewing machine needle just fine, as well as by hand.  The labels may be ironed after sewing in as well.  
TEXT information:
Two lines are optional, please see listing photos as one line will be smaller.  Up to 18 characters/spaces are recommended; text will get smaller and smaller with added characters and/or drop to two lines. Text color is black.  This can be changed, however we advise using the darkest colors possible to retain clear legibility for small fonts.   There is no extra charge for colored fonts.  Default font used is ""Cambria Math."" Please note any changes in font style when ordering, you may list a number from the font choice image, see photo #5.  If I do not have the font you prefer, please request and I'll see what I can do.  =) 
LOGO IMAGES:
If you'd like your personal logo added.  Please send your logo via etsy conversation.  Crop/edit your image as close to the basic shape of you label as possible before sending.  The image should be sharp and crisp and in JPEG or PNG format. Overcompensate on color when creating your image as images print lighter on fabric then on paper - the fabric absorbs more ink. Also, consider darker images if choosing muslin fabric, as muslin lends a more natural, earthy look  - images print softer. 
USAGE AND CARE: 
Machine wash, tumble dry low/delicate. We use high pigment ink and labels will retain high color. The labels will not fray easily as they are heat sealed with a permanent adhesive backing. If there are any strings from the production process, just snip them away.  They are not frays, just an occasional part of the process here in the studio. 
PER SHEET information:
This listing is for one {1} PRE-CUT, set of 70 labels, one design type per sheet.  Each set of labels is created, printed and treated right here in our shop when you order. **Increasing or decreasing individual label size will change amount of labels per sheet on custom orders. Larger labels means less labels per sheet/**  If you change the size, we'll fit as many per sheet as possible. No need for a special listing for this. Also, there are extra labels in each order to account for any printing imperfections.
PROCESSING/Shipping information:
Please allow us up to, but no more than, 1-3 business days handling time before shipping.  Labels ship USPS first class mail in a kraft envelope with a packing invoice. You will receive shipping notice via Etsy.  Orders with proof requested will NOT ship until proof has been approved. Proofs are sent via Etsy message so, check back.  =) These specifics include international orders as well. 
***PLEASE REMEMBER TO PURCHASE EXPEDITED SHIPPING*** if your labels are a rush for a special event, especially if I'm creating a new template for sizing for you.  Orders take 1-3 business days to process here in the shop.  Also plan for time to apply your labels before your event.  =)
***BULK ORDERS*** Please just message me if you need multiple sets of labels and are concerned about time frames or shipping, always willing to help.        ",12.00,4.6723,"Handmade item

15074,Aizome Chiyogami Washi Origami Paper - 5 sheets of Yuzen Chiyogami origami paper,"
            Five sheets of 15 x 15 cm (approx. 6 inches) Japanese Chiyogami origami paper. This paper is gorgeous - vibrant shades of blue with colors so deep that there's texture just from the ink - one sheet of each pattern as shown in the photos. This hand-printed origami paper is luxurious and would delight anyone looking for authentic Japanese washi paper. 
Chiyogami washi paper has a softer, warmer feel to it than commercial papers. Perfect for making lovely origami - or for scrapbooking, book binding, and other paper crafts. Because of the dying process, the color shows through the back slightly, but it is one-sided paper.        ",8.20,4.9459,"Craft type: Origami

~Set of weathered boards~
This listing is for a set of naturally weathered rustic cedar planks. The pieces have been naturally weathered (no chemical has been applied to make them look weathered) and have a wonderful rustic charm. Each is reclaimed so it contains old nail holes, knots, each with unique characteristics! Ready for any crafty project!
These pieces have been pre-cut to measure approximately 14""x 5-5.5"" they are 1/2"" thick. There may be some fraying on the cut edges of the wood.
 The grey is naturally weathered over multiple seasons and will show some variation in color.
Due to the variation in naturally weathered wood, each piece may vary slightly in; grain pattern, coloring, shape, size, curve, knots, blemishes, fraying and weathering.

These 24"" balloons are black and come deflated and filled with your choice of pink or blue feathers and a splash of glitter (of course!).
Notes: 
The feathers in the pictures are a representation of what could be inside your balloon depending on what is available. Currently, we have dark blue and light pink feathers.
If you would like to be surprised along with your guest, simply have a friend (or family member) mail or email me the gender. 
You are also welcomed to have your doctor write it on a piece of paper, so you could then put it in an envelope and mail it to me (without peeking!) and let the surprise be for everyone. Note that this option will delay processing until I receive the baby's gender.
This is such an exciting time! Congrats if you're a mom or dad to be!

16129,"1lb Unrefined Shea Butter, Wholesale, Certified Fair Trade, Certified Organic, Wholesale, Bulk","
            One pound (1lb) of bulk pure of organic unrefined shea butter for lotion making, soap making, hair care and skin care. Shea butter is a great addition to any soap, skin and hair care products. Use it in your formulations to reap all the benefits of this natural, healing, moisturizer. 
WHY BUY OUR SHEA BUTTER?
- Our shea butter is USDA certified organic.
- Our shea butter is Fair Trade USA certified fair trade.
- We have a long history of selling pure shea butter on Etsy with many satisfied customers. See our feedback.
- Astrida Naturals sells only fair trade unrefined shea butter. Fairly traded shea butter is obtained from a source that pays the African women who manufacture the shea a fair price for the product, allowing the women to support themselves, their families, and their communities.
Our Shea Butter is extracted from the Karite (Shea) Nut in Ghana using traditional West African methods that do not utilize chemicals during processing. Because this shea butter is unrefined it retains the highest concentration of healing and moisturizing benefits for raw use or in skin and hair care formulations.
To use in formulas heat very slowly in a double boiler to melt. To prevent grittiness cool rapidly or mix well into formulas while still warm.
Please note, this is a natural product. Color variances may occur but this does not in any way affect the quality of the product.
NEED MORE SHEA?
Larger quantities are available please contact me for details.
How does Shea Butter benefit my skin and hair?
Regular use of unrefined Shea Butter produces softer, smoother healthier skin and is safe for all skin types. Shea Butter is a natural source of vitamins A, E, and F. These antioxidants help the skin to retain its natural elasticity, absorb moisture from the air, and help prevent premature wrinkles by boosting collagen production.
Shea Butter contains natural UV sun protection that is estimated to be around an SPF 6. Daily use of Shea Butter on the face and body reduces sun exposure, which in turn slows down the appearance of aging. Shea Butter also acts as a natural mantle against elements of cigarette smoke, smog and chemical pollutants in the atmosphere.
Shea Butter can also help your hair. It provides moisture to dry or damaged hair from the root to tip, repairing and protecting against weather damage, dryness and brittleness. It also absorbs quickly and completely into the scalp to rehydrate without clogging pores. It is beneficial for processed and heat-treated hair, and is an excellent treatment for dry scalp.

            Knuckle Rings, Set of 7 Midi Rings, in gold-tone wire.
-These handmade knuckle rings (midi rings) come as a set of seven (three chevrons and four bands) and are available in silver tone or gold tone wire.
**If you would like this set in silver, please visit the link below:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/244095324/silver-knuckle-ring-set-midi-ring-set?ref=shop_home_active_1
These rings are so fun and trendy, you are sure to love them.
Because these rings are made to order there will be slight variations.  But each ring will always be of the highest quality materials and workmanship.
-Your rings will be made with 18 gauge artistic gold or silver toned non-tarnish wire.  The 18g wire is slightly heavier wire making the ring a bit more durable than similar items while still being
 simple and elegant rings.
-These rings will hold their shape very well if care is taken when worn. 
- The wire used for these rings is considered ""non-tarnish"", but like anything it will eventually show signs of wear.  To keep the rings at their best it is recommended that you avoid wearing the them while engaged in activities such as sports, swimming, doing dishes or showering. 
******WHAT SIZE SHOULD I ORDER?*********
If the finger you will be wearing the knuckle ring(s) on is size:
7 OR SMALLER, ORDER SIZE . . . . . . . .SMALL
7.5 THROUGH 9, ORDER SIZE . . . . . . . MEDIUM
9 OR LARGER, ORDER SIZE . . . . . . . . LARGER
****NOTE: These rings are adjustable, which means the back is open, allowing for some 
                      adjusting of size by you.
-All rings come in a box to protect them during shipment.  This will ensure you ring will arrive undamaged and ready to wear.  :)
- A note for International purchases: Once shipped the item(s) usually take about two weeks, but can take up to 4 or more weeks to be delivered. Once shipped, I don't have any more information about your package than you and have no control over how quickly the postal service or customs takes to process the package. Please bear this in mind when placing an order

17313,"Minimalist Silver Ear Cuff Non Pierced, Conch Cuff Earring Stack, Sterling Silver Earring Cuff No Piercing, Ear Stack, Fake Conch Ring","
            Sterling silver ear cuff with studded texture. You can buy a single, or a pair for stacking.
This is a non pierced earring. I love these as a way to get the look of extra piercings and extend the party up your ear.
Check out this ear cuff in a super stack:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/502514363/set-of-3-stackable-sterling-silver-ear
The ear cuff has an inner diameter of 10 millimeters, and an opening of 4 millimeters. It is adjustable and fits best in the ""conch"" position, where the cartilage meets the lobe.
Handmade by me from .925 sterling silver. It has polished, rounded ends for easy sliding on and off. The  silver has a bright, shiny finish.
You will receive the ear cuff in a semi-annealed state, that is to say the sterling silver is malleable enough that you can adjust it to fit your ear. If no adjustments are needed, that is also great, because it is sturdy as is.
To make the ear cuff smaller (fit tighter), pinch the ends together between your fingers. To enlarge it, I recommend sliding it down the barrel of a pen or marker that has a larger graduated diameter to gently force the ends apart. If you need any guidance, just contact me!
If you are new to ear cuffs, I find the best way to put one on is to hook it around the cartilage ridge at the top of your ear and then slide it down while gently rotating it over the inside ridge. Once you adjust your cuff for the perfect fit, you will be able to slide it on and off with ease every time, there is no need to open and close it.
Model is wearing a sample earring. You will receive brand new earrings.

17642,Tiny Hoop Earrings. Solid 925 Sterling Silver Hoops. Silver Hoops. Sterling Silver Hoop Earrings. Choose your Size. One PAIR (2 hoops),"
            The Small Hoops are my best seller. Simple and beautiful, these petite hoop earrings are great for everyday wear. They are so comfortable, they can be left in your piercings indefinitely! These hoops are hand-forged, rough edges removed and polished by machine for a beautiful shine.  
Choose your preferred gauge (thickness):
24 gauge - skinny, or thin wire (this is what I've always carried in my shop, if you've purchased from me before.) thin and lightweight, these are perfect for sensitive ears.
22 gauge - standard thickness. 
Then choose which size you would like: 
Small: 1/2 inch (12mm)
Smaller: 3/8ths inch (10mm)
Mini/huggies: 1/4 inch (8mm)
Not sure what size to get? When in doubt go with the ""Smaller"" size 3/8ths inch or (10mm). ""Mini/Huggies"" are best for cartilage or second () piercings. Or if you want space between your ear and the hoop, go with the ""Small"" size 1/2 inch (12mm). 
The photo's were taken with a macro setting. Also available in 14k yellow or rose (pink) gold. See all my handmade hoops here: 
http://www.etsy.com/shop/craftyjules?section_id=6924493
This listing is for TWO hoops. If you need a different quantity or size not found in my shop, please contact me, I would be happy to make some for you.
The Hoop Earrings will be made to order and shipped within 72 hours from purchase.
These hoops are tiny and delicate. Because of their tiny size, they can be a little tricky to get in your ears. It is best to put them in when you aren't rushed and have time and patience to work with them. 
FREE silver polishing cloth included with all orders of 20 or more.------------

            You will receive one (1) 14 gauge (1.6mm) barbell per order
316L Surgical Steel barbell with Rose Gold plating - like all plated body jewelry it will tarnish with constant wearing and if touched with fluids - read my policies page for tips on caring for your plated body jewelry.
This barbell is intended for a scaffold industrial piercing.
Choose your barbell length:
1 1/4"" (32mm)
1 3/8"" (35mm)
1 1/2"" (38mm)
The pearls (6mm each) are faux acrylic and if you over tighten them (easy to do, if you feel any pressure while screwing it on than you must stop or else you'll crack the threading or the entire ball) Most types of acrylic are quite fragile, especially when exposed to cold or direct sunlight or heat can cause warping (showering,etc) Alcohol and other chemicals can crack, degrade, or even destroy this material. I do not accept exchanges or refund body jewelry for reasons explained on my policies page.

18264,F'ck Off Sterling Silver Toe Ring - Solid 925 - TR210,"
            When eloquence falls short of emotions, this fuck off sterling silver ring really says it all to those people who have nothing better to do than stare at your feet. The ring was stamped one letter at a time as a flat band of 18 gauge sterling silver measuring 3mm wide, 1 mm thick and available in any length for a personalized fit. By hammering the ring over a steel ring mandrel with a nylon mallet, I formed the perfect ring shape and left the ends open for easy adjustment. A dark patina was brushed into the fuck off lettering to create outstanding contrast against the tumbled near mirror finish.
The ring is a standard medium sized adjustable toe ring and can also be ordered with a personalized fit by noting your toe circumference or ring size along with any special requests in the notes to seller section during check out. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or call me at 575.737.8521 to discuss any custom requests. Thanks .. Nici        ",12.00,4.9001,"Handmade item

Flip flops are essential to summer fun!  They signal warm sand, cool water, and nights filled with excitement. We’ve decided to transform these summertime staples with personal flair. 
Using only the highest quality commercial vinyl we’ll personalize your flip flops with your name, monogram., or custom design. 
The purchase of this listing is for one pair of personalized flip flops with the following specifications:
Flip Flop colors: 15 different colors (based upon availability)
Font colors:  Over 15 options (see drop down menu)
Brand:  Old Navy flip flops
Sizes:  {women's size 5-11}
Please use the drop down menus to select your flop color, and font color.  
In the notes section, please state the size, and corresponding initials, colors, and if it applies; confirm the order of the monogram as first, LAST, middle.  
A traditional monogram is written as first initial, last initial, and middle initial.  Your monogrammed flip flops will be made exactly to your specifications so double check your text in the Notes to Seller portion of your order.
Each pair of custom flip flops will be unique and as such there will be slight variations compared to those pictures above as examples.

These are the most darling little red leather shoes with a buttoned strap - adorable Mary Jane`s dating to c1910-1930s. Their condition is exactly as seen in my pictures - brimming with unique character and the perfect dinky display. I love them.
The shoes are made from the softest kid leather and have shabby little pom-poms. The small red buttons are both still there - yummy little vintage childhood treasures.
THE MEASUREMENTS...

20421,"Running Belt, Festival Belt, Insulin Pump Belt, iPhone7","
            With phones getting bigger and bigger, carrying them with you while you workout, hang out, or rock out, is becoming more and more difficult. My running belt is the perfect solution. This lightweight breathable, belt easily slides on and with two openings, has room for your phone, keys, I.D, money... everything you need and all while keeping your hands free. The phone pocket is lined with a stay dry wicking fabric that keep your technology safe and dry even on your super sweaty runs.
I cannot run without my music. I previously used an arm band phone case but the iPhone 6 plus was just too big. Now I can easily go for a walk, run or bike ride and have my music and stats with me. The running belt is universal and will fit most phones even the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus s.
Sizing
The running belts run pretty true to standard women's sizes. When ordering, keep in mind if you are going to want to wear it around your hips or at your true waist. If you are between sizes I always recommend ordering a size smaller.        ",12.00,4.8545,"Handmade item
