Aquamarine's name was inspired by the calming feelings the ocean can create in all of us.  It inspires truth and letting go of negativity.  Connected to the throat chakra, it inspires you to speak your truth. It is a very calming stone, one that could benefit anyone wearing it.
Citrine
Often called the SUCCESS stone, citrine has a joyful energy that can assist in combating negativity and bringing good luck to the wearer.  Associated with the solar plexus chakra, citrine is used to manifest willpower, energy, and focus. This  stone never needs energy clearing because it does not absorb negative energy.  It is also the birthstone of November.
Lapis Lazuli

Also said to assist with migraine suffering and to help alleviate the pain associated with these headaches.  Valued by ancient cultures for its intense rich blue color as well.
