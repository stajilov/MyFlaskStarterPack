The ring weighs 16.6 grams and is a easily re-sizable size 14. These stones were named by Tiffany & Co after Tanzania, the country it was discovered. Tanzanites are noted for its remarkably strong trichroism, appearing alternately sapphire blue, violet and burgundy depending on the crystal orientation. They also appear differently when viewed under alternate lighting conditions. The blues appear more evident when subjected to fluorescent light and the violet hues can be seen readily when viewed under incandescent illumination. This ring is a bold statement piece and looks great on the hand. This high end ring is well crafted and very detailed with the nugget design. D'block Tanzanites are impossible to find and only the best. ADDITIONAL 7 PICTURES AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST!! Comes shipped in an exquisite brand new natural redwood and leather ring box.

By definition, vintage jewelry is old and usually pre-owned. Typically jewelry will have some minor signs of wear, and I try to reflect that in the photos whenever apparent. As needed, I have cleaned items with mild soap and water, however, I am listing such a huge quantity of jewelry that I cannot thoroughly clean every bead, link, or other component on every item. Please understand that your purchase may still need a little TLC upon receipt, and is being sold 'AS IS.' Remember, colors may appear slightly different on different computer monitors.

ALL OFFERS WELCOMED AND CONSIDERED. THANKS VERY MUCH!!
Here for your pleasure is one high quality, hand woven wool rug with gentle, muted, and natural colors and bold patterns and designs. The age of this is at least 1970s but they may be much older. I am not sure If they are North or South American. One source said Native American while the other said Peruvian. So you be the judge! it's beautiful, at least vintage, definitely wool, and indubitably made with skill, passion, and love!! There are many experts around and I would love to hear from one who knows more about the rug. Thanks very much! All of these are in beautiful shape with no negative condition issues or odors.  I have three of these vintage wool art rugs (all 40 inches X 20 Inches) listed and I would prefer to sell them as group because I know they are from the same area and the same approximate age. 255 each plus shipping or or all three for 550 and FREE (within USA) shipping.  Message me and I will modify the listings. Thanks for looking.

5293,Original Vintage 1941 JohnJames Audubon Birds of America Bookplate Print Bird Print 311 White Pelican 312 Old Squaw,"
            Offered is an  ORIGINAL ( NOT a 1.00 REPRODUCTION) Vintage 1941 John James Audubon Book Plate, Print, or Bird Print
No.      311   White Pelican        and/or            No.  312     Old Squaw
Note:  
These bookplates, prints, or pages are two (2) sided.  In other words, there is a bird print on each side.  You can decide which side to display when you frame the print.  The prints do not show through when framed.
I am  pleased to offer my very large collection/inventory of prints, bookplates, bird prints, or Ornithological Prints of done by John James Audubon for his work,"" Birds of America.  I have removed or cut these prints from the books in which they were published.  These are NOT ""art print"" reproductions.
The books were published in 1941.  I have several of these books.  I did antique shows all over the US for many years. I also had an antique shop.  I sold these prints like crazy at antique shows and in my antique shop.  But I still have many left, (I bought a lot of books!).  I am offering these prints at a great price.  MUCH less than I sold them for at shows and my shop.
The prints measure about  8"" to 8 1/2""  by 12"".
NOTE: 
If you order more than one (1) bookplate or print, the bookplates or prints will probably not be the same size or have the same age  toning, as they will come from different books.  The books age and tone differently depending on the elements to which they were exposed.  Also, the books were manually cut.  
These bookplates or prints are all in very good condition.  However, ALL of these bookplates or prints have age toning or yellowing.  This is inevitable with these old prints.  The paper they used for Audubon's ""Birds of America"" was good paper but it was not top of the line.  These books were made to be affordable for the middle class.  Thus, they all have toning.  A few bookplates or prints may also have some small faint spots.  This is foxing and is common with age.
These bookplates or prints are beautiful framed.  You can have them matted or not.  Many, but not all of these plates will work in 8"" x 10"" frames.  BUT, you will NOT be able to see or display the name and description.  This is a matter of preference.  I have several framed Audubons in my home.  I have some in  8 x 10's and some that are matted and framed in larger frames.  Up to you.
Sales Tax of 8.25% applies to Texas Residents.
Please email with any questions.
These bookplates or prints will be mailed USPS 1st Class Mail with cardboard reinforcement.
I will ship my Audubons to the  US ONLY!        ",12.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1940s

5595,Circa 1910 Empire Style Hair Comb,"
            The “Second Empire” style was made popular by Napoleon III’s reign in France (1852-1870), but its influence lasted for many years after 1870. This comb is a really beautiful example of this lasting influence with its curved shape and Renaissance Revival design. The repousse brass work is gorgeous with garlands and lions making a surprisingly elegant juxtaposition. The blue, pressed-glass accents are an interesting touch, pulling this piece into the turn of the century with its fake hieroglyphs. The blue glass bits and machine stamped brass are very much Czechoslovakian in style. The hair comb is molded celluloid made to imitate tortoise shell.
This piece is in beautiful vintage condition. All the metal parts are present and not broken. There is patina to the metal but no green or brass rot. The front surface of the comb is very shiny and unblemished. There are a series of scratches on the back of the comb. I am not sure where they came from, but they are only on the back (see photo) and they do not detract from the beautiful front of the piece.
The body of the comb spans apx. 4 1/8” across by 3” tall. The repousse metal design is apx. 1” and the comb teeth are 1 7/8” long.
Comes wrapped in tissue with a description card.        ",96.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1910s

Good Condition - No stains, rips or odors. Missing some fur on one side around the edges. 
---The 70's era was of a celebration of peace but also of chaos and turmoil. It was a time of funky music with matching funky clothes. Women were finally ""allowed"" to let their hair down and work outside the home. Technology in homes like calculators, colored T.V. and microwaves became the norm. The 1970s also saw an initial increase in violence in the Middle East, and the Vietnam War didn't end till 1975.

            Pet supplies miniature dachshund small dogs boots lined with warm fleece with anti skid on the bottom of each foot. I use Velcro at top of each leg for a secure fit while your dog is outside. The boots are 2 layers of fleece. My dachshunds have trouble with their feet freezing up on very cold winter days just going outside to potty I stay right with them ready to pick them up so I knew I needed to do something more to help them.  These boots have worked for my dogs. Boots are machine wash and dry. When your dog comes in then place the boots near warmth if they are damp from the snow.  These boots make great gift for your pet or someone else's miniature or small dog. I would be happy to match a dog coat you have ordered from our company (provided the fabric is still available) or buy a solid color to go with a coat.

7621,Herbal Bath Tea kits - choose your blend,"
            Everyone loves a good soak in their tub, especially after a long day.....Treat yourself!
My all natural bath teas are made with amazing herbs that I purchase from our local health food store.  These bath tea kits come with a 4' X 6"" reusable muslin tea bag and an 8 oz mason jar filled with enough herbs for 3-4 baths.  Simply fill the drawstring bag with 1-2 tablespoons of the herbal blend, draw the string tight and for best results, hang on the tub spout allowing the water to pass through the bag.  Then when you are finished with your long soak, simply discard the herbs and let bag dry out for your next bath.
You can choose from the following blends:
Relaxing Blend:  lavender, chamomile, dandelion root and oatmeal.  All these ingredients have wonderful antioxidant benefits that also helps with headaches and insomnia.  I add in Epsom and Pink Himalayan salts for their anti-inflammation properties that also treats dry skin and sore muscles.  Lastly, I add in the perfect amount of orange essential oil for a refreshing touch!
Sore Muscles Blend:  rosebuds & petals, calendula, rosemary leaves and oatmeal.  The herbs all have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties.  The Epsom and Pink Himalayan salts add extra relief for sore muscles as well as several drops of rosemary essential oil.
These are sold in 8oz reusable jars with a wooden spoon for 12
I also sell convenient refills that will fill up your jar three times!
Thank you for checking out my natural products~
*~Nevaeh~*
Legal things I have to tell you~
As with most things you need to be careful if you have allergies,  be aware of the different herbs/ingredients and test by placing your hand in the bath water to make sure you don't have a reaction to any of the ingredients found in your tea bath. Some essentials oils and herbs should be avoided during pregnancy, please check with your doctor.  Also use caution getting in and out of your tub.  These teas are not made to be ingested.  :)        ",12.00,5.0,"Handmade item

7788,Dried Lavender Bouquets,"
            Our dried lavender bouquets of approximately 125 stems, will spruce up any space while adding a hint of lavender fragrance. No maintenance necessary!
The French lavender has a stronger, woodsy lavender aroma like you would associate with soaps and perfumes.  These bouquets measure 16-20 inches long with a crown of 8 inches. The  buds are a light lavender color.  (photos 1 & 2)
The English lavender imparts a soft sweet lavender aroma, measures 10-12 inches in length and the crown of the bouquet is 6-8 inches. The bud color is a dark purple with small delicate buds. (photos 3 & 4)
Please remember this is an all natural product with some variations in the individual bundles. Our Certified Naturally Grown lavender is hand harvested fresh from our field in the morning hours after the dew has dried. This method insures we can meticulously capture the lavender at it's peak beauty and aroma. We hang and store these bundles in a protected environment in order to deliver top notch quality to our customers.
Our lavender is grown in the beautiful foothills of Northern Colorado. We have two plots, with roughly 300 plants in each, and distill our own essential oil. Growing lavender has been a passion for us since 2009, and we now boast 30 different varieties. Our market garden is a tribute to the memory of our parents, who were agriculturalists in Colorado and Kansas. We try to do things the old-fashioned way, just how our forefathers did.

8731,UC BERKELEY HILLS in 1936 Watercolor Painting,"
            Giclee reproduction of a watercolor painting by Mabel Minnich Miller [my grandmother].
Mabel Minnich Miller, a California native, graduated in Fine Arts at UC Berkeley in 1937. She also attended the California College of Arts in Oakland. Her high school sweetheart, Francis E. Miller--an electrical engineering graduate student--proposed under the Campanile and they were married in Berkeley in 1936, the year she created this painting.
Printed in the USA on acid-free 100% cotton rag with archival inks.
Includes a copy of the story, with a photo of the artist standing on the hill above the campus in that era. I recommend having the story card mounted on the back when you have it framed.
Original size: 12.25 x 15.5 inches / Other sizes available.

9517,Ministry of Silly Walks John Cleese Articulated Paper Doll - Monty Python Lovers,"
            This paper doll is based on John Cleese's sketch ""The Ministry of Silly Walks"" from Monty Python's Flying Circus. 
The original design is scanned and then laser printed on heavy 140# index paper (cardstock).  He is cut and assembled by me with tiny brads to make him posable. This ministry worker has a lot of joints! His briefcase and umbrella move as well, but the umbrella is very delicate and you should take great care when moving it into silly walk positions!
He is about 12 inches tall and about  3 inches wide. He has 12 articulating joints.
""lt's not particularly silly, is it? I mean, the right leg isn't silly at all and the left leg merely does a forward aerial half turn every alternate step.""
""Yes, but I think that with Government backing I could make it very silly.""
The perfect gift for any Python fan.        ",12.00,5.0,"Handmade item

13572,Wedding Fascinator Doves,"
            Wedding - Fascinator in the color of champagne with a couple of doves with the golden rings in their beaks. 
The round Fascinatorbase is covered with satin, on several vintage leaves. The doves are sitting in a nest of satin roses in different shades of white (champagne, cream, ecru / off white). 
In the nest are some large, matt shimmering pearls. Behind the pigeons protrudes a fine Hutnetz skyward, decorated with delicate feathers and Knospenrispen.
By combining different white tones this opulent headdress fits to many wedding dresses. 
If needed you can choose another colour of satin for the  Fascinatorbasis inmany shades of white: Clean white, champagne, cream, ecru / off white, ivory, but also pink and apricot. Just ask for a special design :)
It's a solid handwork was the sewn and not just glued.
With 2 alligator clips this lovely piece holds where it belongs: you can fix the Fascinator also on a hair circlet, if you have extremely short hair.
Alternatively, I can also have a hair comb mount, but this I recommend only full and long hair.
If the Fascinator is part of an elaborate bridal hairstyle, you are best advised with the alligator clips. This keeps a long very moving day.

19039,British Suede and Lambswool Handmade Moccasin Slippers,"
            Sheepland Ltd is our family run sheepskin business, we've been lovingly handcrafting our Slippers and accessories in our Somerset Workshop since 1986, which enjoys views of Glastonbury Tor. We pride ourselves on using British materials, e.g. British wool and sheepskin as much as possible to keep this traditional industry alive. These suede and lambswool Moccasins are still made by hand using the traditional methods right here in Somerset. The lining is a wool lining, which is literally sheared from the sheep in the Spring and is later affixed to a backing fabric, which means it is much less expensive then whole sheepskin. The wool lining is natural undyed wool and gives a cosy inside which will keep you warm throughout the Winter months. These Suede Moccasins can be made without a sole (soft sole) or with a firm rubber sole to allow you to pop outside if need be. We would recommend ordering your usual size, if you are a half size we would suggest ordering up a size. These Suede Moccasins are perfect for all the family, without the price tag of pure sheepskin, these wool lined Moccasins really are the next best thing.
When ordering please include your phone number and the foot size (US/UK/EU) these slippers are required for in the notes section. This is to ensure we make and send the correct item ASAP. We will never share your information with anyone.        ",26.52,4.9762,"Handmade item

Have you always wanted a tattoo but too afraid to commit? Well, here's your chance to rock it without the commitment. Scare all your friend and family. Temporary tattoos are a great way to try out a tattoo before you take the plunge.
This temporary tattoo sleeve is approximate 7 inches long.
Our temporary tattoos are waterproof and last up to a week with proper care.
................................................................................................................
HOW TO MAKE YOUR TEMPORARY TATTOO LAST LONGER:
1. When your temporary tattoo gets wet, you should always pat dry, not rub. Also, try to avoid hot water as much as possible like a Jacuzzi or long bath.
2. Don't use soap, oil, sunscreen or perfume on your temporary tattoo.
3. Always pat dry after showering and lightly dust with loose powder after showering and before bed to help reduce friction.
................................................................................................................
HOW TO REMOVE YOUR TEMPORARY TATTOO:
You can use any kind of oil or rubbing alcohol to remove your temporary tattoo.
