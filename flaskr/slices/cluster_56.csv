1067,Vintage Joseff of Hollywood Earrings,"
            ""Wow"" is the first word that comes to mind when looking at these vintage copper Joseff earrings. Especially if you know anything about the designer's reputation in the industry!!!
These earrings have a twisty 2 1/2 inch drop from the clip/lobe. The clips are in tight/good working condition. The earrings are signed and would be a statement piece or a valuable addition for a collector.
Known as the ""jeweler to the stars,"" Joseff of Hollywood Jewelry made it's reputation by providing the vast majority of jewelry used in Hollywood movies during the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's (although he did not make jewelry from 1942-1944). Owner and designer Eugene Joseff created jewelry as glamorous as the era and place in which he worked. ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""Around the World in Eighty Days"" are just two of many movies enhanced by Joseff jewelry.
He wanted the jewelry used in period movies to have a basis in historical fact, and the combination of the requirements of the movie industry and his own creative genius resulted in some of the most fabulous jewelry of ever made. 
Mr. Joseff died in 1948, and his wife, Joan Castle Joseff has spearheaded Joseff jewelry since that time. Joan Joseff branched out into providing Joseff jewelry for TV stars from the Fifties on, as well as expanding the retail market until her death in 2010.

The eye size is 52 mm,  bridge size 18 mm and temple length is 140 mm. The lens depth is 45 mm. There is very minor scratches on the inside temple area. There are no demo lenses in this frame. 
New old stock frames are frames that have not been worn. These will be sturdier than putting your prescription into a 
frame that formerly held prescription lenses and worn. Wearing a plastic frame ages the plastic as it is heated by the 
wearer, slowly aging the plastic, making it more brittle over time. The same can be said for the nosepads on a metal 
frame, but these are replacable. Please look at the above measurements for this frame. Compare them to the 
sizing of your current frame. There are markings on all optical shop frames. Choosing a frame of similiar measurements
will increase your satisfaction with your new frame purchase. Sometimes a trip to the optical shop to try on frames of 
the same of similiar sizing will be a time saver in the end.
I work in the eye care industry and have for the past 30 years and have a special interest in eyeglass frames. 
I price at a fraction of the price of new, modern frames. I have a large quantity of frames that were stored for 30 years  
after an optical shop closed. These are ""new, old stock"". Most have demo lenses. These lenses may be scratched or cracked.
I have included them as they were original to the frame. There may be slight imperfections in the frame that are listed
above. I listed with as many photos as allowed. If you have any questions or need more photos please contact me. 
Frames are sold WITHOUT WARRANTY. If an optical shop breaks your frame while it is in their hands, you will have
 to go by their policy. 
I will ship each frame in a box using first class mail. Frames are returnable if your contact me within 7 days of receipt 
of frame. Buyer pays return postage. Return must be shipped back within one week of correspondence. This item comes to you 
from a smoke free, pet free home. Thank you for your interest.        ",49.99,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1980s

            George Petty embraced the world of pin up or, girlie art like no other artist.  His girls were naughty, but dream-like...a Petty Girl can not be mistaken for another's artwork.  He had a long career and created beautiful artwork mainly for Esquire and True Magazines.
His real claim to fame in the pin-up world is how popular his girls were for ""nose art"" painted on planes in World War II, including the famous Memphis Belle.
This is a deck of cards No. 51 -100 in the second series of ""The Petty Girls"" issued by 21st Century Archives in 1995.  Each card features a Petty girl on the front and a description or comment on the back with the original year each drawing was created.  The deck covers reproduction of artwork done for Esquire Magazine from 1933 until 1956.
The deck is complete and in great condition...another piece from my husband's extensive pin-up collection...I may never through it!        ",59.00,4.9474,"Vintage item

5265,Authentic vintage French school poster Rossignol,"
            Very rare, this authentic poster on the theme of the natural sciences represents on its first side, the snakes. And birds on its reverse  These posters were used in the French schools in the 50s.
It is very sought for its aspect ornamental as for its vintage aspect
It's really a very rare and exceptional poster. That explains the price
Side 1 : The snakes
Side 2 : The birds
Measures 90x75 cm
BE CAREFUL: There are words wrote with a green chalk on the face ""snakes"" of the hand of teacher, visible on the photo, which strengthen the vintage and authentic aspect
The poster is the custom in good condition. (TBE see CGV) it presents normal signs of wear (some folds and small tears on the border) for a poster old woman 50-year-old and used in schools. Borders are a little tried by the humidity.  it is fragile as any paper of more 70 years
Colors are less lively than on the photo, what gives a softer and older aspect
This poster must be sent by ""french international colissimo"" because its measures are too long for the normal sending
it is sent by ""relais colis"" for France and UE        ",36.64,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            NEW SHOP PROMO - USE COUPON WHOLESOMEBATHBOMBS FOR 10% OFF 
Buying bulk order seems more expensive, but you get to save over 15 on shipping!
We offer multiple sizes, medium size being a heavy 6-8oz and larger than a tennis ball and large size (more XL) 10-12oz and much larger than a tennis ball at 3.15oz. IF YOU BUY 2 MINI, PLEASE NOTE THAT THEY ARE FOR SAMPLE ONLY AND WILL NOT FULLY COLOR/FRAGRANCE YOUR TUB.
Spice up any bath with this relaxing and rejuvenating activated charcoal bath bomb. This bath bomb will turn your bath water pitch black! Please note that these bath bombs are packed with a lot of detoxifying activated charcoal. This means that it has the potential to lightly stain you and your tub. Taking a light shower after will get rid of any stains on your body and most of it off the tub. 
Recommended fragrances: 
This bath bomb is great with any fragrance you'd like :) 
Sizes:
Our bath bombs are quite large and more compact than others so you may use one multiple times. Mini size is around 1.40"" and 1-2oz. We recommend using all 4 in one bath. Medium size is 2.75"" and 6-8oz. We recommend using one for up to 2 baths. Large sizes are 3.15"" and 10-12oz. We recommend the large one for up to 3 uses. You can easily cut them into slices with a sharp knife or you can just use one whole bath bomb for one bath. For the fullest coloration and fragrance, we recommend using the whole bath bomb. 
Shipping & Packaging:
All bath bombs are placed in a biodegradable plant-based plastic bag and a kraft twist tie. There are labeled stickers on both sides of the bag and a how to use guide. They will be shipped in a box, size depending on the order quantity and size. The bath bomb is padded with thin packing paper to prevent cracking/breakage. They will be shipped within 3-9 days after the purchase and you can pick the shipping plans you want. For larger orders exceeding 5 bath bombs, please expect a delay as it will take a longer time to create and pack. 
Please check ingredients for possible allergies. If any irritation occurs, please stop using. Avoid getting the bath water directly into your eyes, as you would do with most other bath/shower products.
All our fragrance oils are phthalate free. However, if you are still worried about fragrance oils, you can pick natural essential oils (with the EO ending) instead.
All our ingredients are cruelty-free and we don't conduct nor condone any animal testing in any of our products.
There might be staining, but you should very easily be able to clean it up with water. If not, a sponge and cleaner may also work. There should be no harsh staining, though.

8755,100% Pure and Natural Organic Peppermint Essential Oil,"
            Botanical Name: Mentha piperita
Method of Extraction: Steam Distilled
Parts  Used: Leave 
Color: Clear to light Yellow
Consistency: Thin
Perfumery Note: Top
Scent: mint scent
Origin: Japan
The health benefits of peppermint oil include its ability to treat indigestion, respiratory problems, headache, nausea, fever, stomach and bowel spasms and pain. Due to the presence of menthol, menthone and menthyl esters, peppermint and peppermint oil find wide applications in manufacture of soap, shampoo, cigarette, toothpaste, chewing gum, tea and ice cream.
Peppermint is a cross between watermint and spearmint and is native to Europe. Historically, the herb has been known for its medicinal uses, and its impressively long history often gives it the prestigious title as the world’s oldest medicine.
Precautions of Peppermint Essential Oil
 Do not apply to skin to be exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light; it increases the skin’s photo sensitivity.  it may irritate sensitive skin. Always test for skin sensitivity prior to widespread use and use on the feet when possible. Excessive use of any oil can lead to skin sensitization. Keep out of eyes, ears, or nose. Not all oils are created equal, so test it carefully, and it is better to avoid any essential oil throughout Pregnancy.        ",2.50,4.7841,"Handmade Supply

Produces authentic old steam train whistle sound when blown into. There are imitators, but none can achieve the great sound of this original train whistle. Easy to blow. Wood whistle measures 1 3/8 inches square and 8 inches long. Has smoothly sanded edges and surfaces and an exclusive, rounded mouthpiece.

            Add a southwestern feel to your Yeti, tumbler, wine glass, laptop or even car with this Cactus Decal.
**********ORDERING************
Use the drop down menu to select the size of your decal and the color for the name.
In the ""note to seller section"" state:
1. Name desired on decal
Failure to include any of the necessary information may cause delays.
************************************
Please be careful in listing the name with correct spelling. I create each name as listed and will not provide a refund for incorrect monograms unless it was an error on my end. 
Each decal is made with high grade indoor/outdoor vinyl.  Both the gold and silver options are metallic in nature.  Carnation Pink is the only matte shade. 
If choosing to place this decal on glassware, please HAND WASH ONLY and do not soak or scrub. 
Due to the tackiness of the vinyl it is not recommended to place on walls or surfaces in which the finish may come off. 
Decals traditionally last longer on harder surfaces and will last the least amount of time on rubbery surfaces. 
*Monograms are removable but not reusable. 
*Due to calibration differences between computer monitors and tablets, the color may vary slightly from what you see on your screen.
If you need instructions for applying your decal, please check MVillStyles.com        ",2.50,4.9348,"Handmade item

14654,"4 Feet, 18ga Copper Solder Wire, Brazing Wire, Made in USA, 93% Copper","
            Four feet (48"") of wire.  I am providing this wire in two formats (please state your preference in the comments at checkout):
93% pure copper solder / brazing wire.  7% phosphorus
Specs:
Country of Origin:  USA
Melt Temp:  1310 F  710 C
Flow Temp:  1460 F  793 C
Thickness:  18ga (approx 1mm)
Flow:  Fast
Ductility:  Poor.  (not for use on ferrous or nickel based materials because the joint will become brittle and may fail).
Best Uses:  Copper, brass, bronze.   Always flux brass and bronze joints.  No need to use flux on copper but flux will help with preventing some firescale.
A tiny quantity of this is all you need for torch soldering bezels and jump rings!  I use this to solder jump rings and bezels made from the #110 copper wire that I also sell.   Please note that I do not claim for this material to be a ""color match.""  Depending upon how you use it, it may or may not match your copper.  For example, after filing and/or sanding a soldered joint this solder will look grey.  But do not despair!  Simply heat it back up with your torch until you see a color change and carry on.  The heat from the flame will bring the copper back up to the surface to give you the copper color.  If you are just starting out, practice is the key!
(The second picture shows a sample pure copper chain I made using this brazing wire and 18 gauge #110 bare copper wire. I have even used this solder and the 24ga copper strip I offer to make some really funky belt buckles for my son's steampunk costume! I will try to show you guys a picture soon).
Cut with medium to heavy wire cutters or preferably with solder cutting pliers (your best flush cutting pliers are not recommended).  Soldering your own metal pieces is fun!  Cut into tiny pieces using your wire cutters inside a plastic bag to keep the pieces from flying around the room.  Use safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying pieces of solder!   Do not cut solder in the presence of children or others without eye protection.  Avoid creating and breathing metal dust and fumes in an non-ventilated space.  Always have a carbon monoxide detector in the room with you!  Have fun and be safe creating what you imagine.  
Check out more copper wire and supplies here:
https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheSparkleStore?section_id=15241312&ref=shopsection_leftnav_3
Check back often as I add more varieties of brazing wire with complete disclosure of their metal contents.  
Please use caution when opening the roll to prevent the ends of the coil from springing into face and eyes.        ",2.50,4.9958,"Craft type: Electronics & circuitry, Jewelry making, Metalworking, Robotics, Stained glass

17188,Tunnel earrings Plug weights Plugs hoops Hoop plugs Tribal earrings Purple gauges Ear plugs Large hoop earrings Large plugs Dangle plugs,"
            Im stretching my ears since two years and I made those hoops simply because I cannot find anything better to fit with my clothing line. I have collected material over the years and I like to do a lot of various crafts, so those represent my love of handmade, my love of exentricity. By wearing those gypsy loops, you will claim your right to be yourself 😀 
Technical part 😀
Firstly you must have stretched ears to wear those dangles, and they are not intended to be worn on bare lobes. Your tunnels plugs must have a hole large enought to pass the closure trought.
I made those hoop earrings from recycling bangles I own. I use some yarn remnant from my knitting skein, so no waste. The large bead took me ages to do because I wanted large beads without all the weight. I wrapped paper mache, then added clay to smooth the surface and finally ended with my handmade flower clay canes and some paint. 
Weight: around 29 gramms each
Circumference: 4""!
February UPDATE: please take in account that I do my very best to represent the true colors of my items by taking my photos outside in natural light,I use a fuji XT10 camera and no filter at all on etsy. My instagram photography work is not used on Etsy. Each monitors display photos differently. Thank you
This pair is one of a kind and will not be duplicated🍀
If you need any other specific question Im always there to help.
Please take note that this listing only include the earrings hoops, not the tunnel plugs.
I ship my packages with tracking and most of them are received within a week in USA. Multiple orders are usually sent in express (4 days).
