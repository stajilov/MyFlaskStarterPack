311,Real Leaf Wallet,"
            WALLET
The premium quality wallet made with real tree leaves, coated in a water-resistant polymer. Leaves of Indian sal tree are used in our designs. Every leaf is dried and coloured to give the material a unique pattern. Every bump of the material can be felt on the wallet surface. No leather or toxic treatments applied. Leaves are lighter than leather, so the leaf wallets are light and sturdy too. A great gift with a great impact for the environment.
- Premium aesthetic and feel.
-Wallet's sides are backed with extra thick frame. It doesn’t bend or squeeze the cards and money, keeps it original shape. 
- Extremely tough but light.
- The coin section is an expandable pocket with a quality zinc alloy magnet.
- Wallet has softened rounded corners. Stitches are done with extreme precision.
-Available in Emerald Green, Ash Black, Turquoise, Light Brown and Orange.
SAL TREE
To produce this item, Thamon uses sustainably sourced leaves of sal tree growing in India. Sal leaves reach up to 25cm and grow on a wooden stem, thus creating stunning patterns for ethical fashion accessories. All our materials are treated without toxic components to make them resistant to water and physical damage. 15% of revenues  of Thamon go directly to the leaf harvesters in poor rural areas of South Asia.

Each perch has 3 holes drilled into it to allow nails to hang it to the wall, comes with 3 nails so it can be put up right away! I leave the bark on the perch, your parakeet will probably pick at it and over time remove the bark. The base will be finished with a layer of beeswax and tung oil which darkens the wood and brings out the natural designs in the wood, this is safe for birds, the bark will not be coated with it, only the base unless otherwise specified. I can remove the bark layer upon request, I can also coat the whole perch with the beeswax and tung oil, but will only do so upon request!

            Do you have a scaly child of your own that you love to spoil to death? Do you sometimes get teased by friends and family because lets face it; your cold blooded baby lives the life of a prince/princess? 
What better gift gift to give your reptile than a fashionable hammock for them to lounge in? 
This particular hammock is great for Crested Geckos, Gargoyle Geckos, Day Geckos, and any other arboreal gecko or lizard of the same size. If you put the hammock close enough to the ground,  your Leopard Geckos or other small terrestrial reptile would gladly climb on to it. 
These hammocks are washing machine safe, however don't put them in the dryer; They WILL SHRINK. Let them Air dry.
To help your hammock stick, put a little water on the suction cups and press onto the glass/acrylic/plastic (As in tupperware plastic) of your baby's cage. The water helps the cups stay put.
I have several designs right now, you can pick which ever you like down in the variations option! To see each design, look at the last picture posted. It'll show you all the patterns and colors we offer.

{♥ NOTE FROM SELLER ♥}
Hi there & welcome to Stone Creek Nursery of Blue Creek, Ohio! Every reborn you see here has been created by us in our home. It takes us approximately 1-2 weeks to bring a custom reborn to life, but your wait time depends on how many other Momma’s have orders ahead of yours! During the busier times of the year, such as Christmas your wait time can be up to 10 weeks. If you want an approximate ship date, please ask BEFORE ordering. Once you have placed your order there is a 12 hour cancellation period where you can request a refund. Once 12 hours has passed, this is no longer an option. We do not offer returns, exchanges, or refunds. However, we do have a 7 day policy where if we have made any mistakes on your order we will fix them ASAP! Shipping is on us to do so!
We reborn 5 days a week & have been doing so for a while now, so we have lots of experience. We work together to achieve a one-of-a-kind look on each baby that is hard to find anywhere else! We take ALOT of pride in our work here at Stone Creek Nursery & you will never receive a poorly made product. We hope that you can enjoy working with us to make your dream baby possible.

            Wooden Deckle Paper Making Kits are for creative people interested in recycling paper to make handmade paper in a variety of sizes, for a variety of purposes. This kit was designed by me, and is exactly what I use to make paper for my pressed flower botanical art.

Handmade paper is so wonderful to create with, and can be used for making cards, journals, gift tags, stationary, altered books, scrap booking, decorative bowls, collages, botanical art compositions, and much more.
This kit contains:  
*  A high quality handcrafted pine mold and deckle (for forming 5""x7"" sheets of paper)
*  A comprehensive instruction booklet, complete with detailed instructions, fun paper making recipes, creative ideas, and more.
*a sponge, and couching sheets (you'll understand when you see the instructions)
*  Bonus Paper making additions:  (things to add to your paper to give it pizazz), such as:  fragrant lavender buds, flower petals, interesting fibers, shredded U.S. currency (a kid favorite), and natural blender flax, and more.  NOTE:  Kits shipped outside of the USA do NOT include flower petals, lavender buds, or any organic matter due to customs regulations.

15430,"Fused Glass Tree, PDF E-Pattern, Tutorial","
            This pattern is for all levels! It comes with an 18 page full color instruction guide detailing each step so everyone can make this three dimensional fused glass tree. Learn to make your own slumping molds using simple materials and in three firings you'll have a tree! There is no fancy hardware or expensive molds to buy! Make it six inches or thirty six inches, the process is the same. Use colored glass or clear glass and you can even add LED lights for a festive tree. Even the lights are integrated right into the design so messy wires are hidden. This pattern is different from the ""Tree For All Seasons"" as it is made almost entirely out of frit and requires only basic glass cutting skills to make the trunk.The slumping techniques are also much more simple.
This version is a PDF electronic pattern that is downloaded. You save on shipping but still get all the same great features. The guide includes; a tools & supplies list, easy to follow instructions, dozens of photographs and multiple design suggestions. 
Please note; my other listing includes a CD with the full color instruction guide in PDF format.

15589,Tree Metal Stamp- 6mm Wonderful Oak-Style Tree,"
            Being a complete tree hugger, this has got to be one of my FAVORITE stamps!  Plus, the tree design is very reminiscent of a live oak, which just so happens to be one of my favorite trees!  This stamp is perfect for anyone with a love of nature who wants to add that perfect something to their next metal project!  The impression is about 6mm wide. Just use a nice sturdy work surface (a bench block is best) and heavy hammer to create whatever is in your imagination! The impressions are crisp, clean and FUN!!!!  Plus, the stamp has been cleverly designed with the image etched on the side. This was you can quickly identify the stamp you want AND always know which way to hold the punch so the impression comes out in the proper orientation.  These stamps have not been tested on steel, but work GREAT on all the softer metals (ie copper, brass, sterling, gold fill and plated).

QuestandCloth adores vintage that's a bit rusty, weathered and has lots of aged character. Having passed through many hands and homes is what makes pre-loved items unique. I do my best to describe what can be perceived as a flaw. Shopping secondhand and rehoming pieces is a wonderful thing. Please contact me for any questions or concerns and thanks for viewing!

20731,"Vintage umbrella with jeweled handle, 1950's umbrella with double canopy, embossed and jeweled handle and jeweled ribs","
            This is a very pretty umbrella from the 1950's with a 2-layer nylon canopy: the outside is grey in the center, shading to black at the scalloped edge, and the inside has an abstract print in blue and green. The silver metal handle has an embossed pattern of roses on the shaft, ending with a pyramid-shaped piece with a textured finish, set with a large faceted blue glass stone. The ribs are tipped with blue glass cabochons. The ferrule is a piece of pointed silver metal 3"" long. There's a label inside reading: ""MADE IN ITALY  Triminghams  BERMUDA"". The piece is 34"" long and 35"" in diameter when opened. It's in very good condition with just a few pin holes and some faint spots. The umbrella is in good working order with ribs and stretchers intact.
