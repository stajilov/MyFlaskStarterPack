290,"Vintage ANTOSEK Suitcase,Brown Leather Suitcase, Old Suitcases, Old Luggage, Vintage Luggage, Luggage, Suitcases, 1940's Suitcase Photo Prop","
            GORGEOUS 1940's vintage ANTOSEK Real Top Grain Cowhide Brown leather suitcase with fantastic vintage character. Great Suitcase Photo Prop
Please note that this listing is for the bigger suitcase, the matching train case is a separate listing.
Made in Philadelphia USA, these are rather hard to come by especially in this nice condition, the size is PERFECT for a weekend trip, all the hardware is in working condition, the inside lining is clean and comes with a pink satin pouch for jewelry or whatever you want to keep separate from the rest of your items.
The leather has some nicks here and there but it's in overall amazing condition for its age (please refer to all photos for details, I'd be happy to answer any questions or provide more photos).
Suitcase measures :
Width 6.5""
Length 18""
Height 12.5""
Note on suitcase smell: 
I have over 100 vintage and antique suitcase, I'm an avid collector, I pick these gems all over the country and they don't always come from a separate ""luggage room"", I pick most from attics and barns etc and since so many have been closed for many years they don't *always* smell fresh as a daisy. There are countless tutorials on how you can take the smell off of vintage and antique suitcases and they seem to work wonderfully, I however don't have the time or enough sunny days (I live in Maine lol) to do each and everyone of them, so please keep that in mind when you purchase one from me, if you're someone who's highly sensitive to ""that vintage smell"" please keep that in mind.
Note on shipping:
When it comes to shipping these babies, you have the option of Priority Mail with a delivery of 2 to 3 business days OR FedEx home delivery with a delivery window of up to 10 business days. I tend to box everything up (try to at least) the same day (except for the weekend), if you have any questions regarding this please don't hesitate to ask. I will also always refund any shipping overages over 2.        ",99.00,4.9867,"Vintage item from the 1940s

            Vintage new old stock fortune teller game contains the making of a fun party game experience. 
Produced by ""The Fun Manufacturing Co.,"" the vintage game contains a small game board entitled Fortune Teller's Hand Book Funny Fortunes by I.C. Stars. the ""secret edition."" Also included in the package are small cardboard game tokens marked with zodiac signs.

The game board measures 4 inches by 2 1/2 inches folded in half. The cardboard game tokens about a 3/4 inch diameter.  The game is new old stock and shows light shelf wear.

            This antique etched glass bottle either came from a very upscale pharmacy or the boudoir of a lovely lady in France.  It is exquisitely etched with flowers and leaves and would work almost anywhere.
This bottle is from approximately 1900. It is in lovely condition, no scratches, cracks or chips.
It can be filled with bath salts, bubble bath or just left empty. A lovely accessory for your bathroom or boudoir.
The lovely cork is sterling silver.  I do not believe it is the original cork but it is gorgeous.
It measures 8 inches high with the cork and 7 without the cork.  It is about 3 1/2 inches wide. 20x18x9 cm

5628,OOAK 1920 Hair Comb PAIR Art Deco Rhinestone Silver Leaf Antique Bridal HeadPiece Vintage Wedding Dress Clip Hairpiece Downton Abbey Jewelry,"
            Offering a PAIR of One-of-a-Kind exquisite Art Deco leaf shaped pave rhinestone bridal hair combs made from very high-end authentic 1930s - 1940's clear crystal dress/fur clips.  I've seen lots of these Art Deco/Art Nouveau leaf shaped clips but have never seen this particular design before.  They are so much more beautiful with so much more sparkle than photos imply! The 2 inches (5 cm) wide by 1 7/8 inches (4.7 cm) high jewels have been securely attached to new high quality silver plated hair combs. Ornate openwork settings are completely encrusted with tiny round cut clear sparkly paved crystals accented with veins of SO Art Deco baguette cut crystals. These clips are very well made and absolutely stunning! My combs are designed to stay in place; the jewels have been mounted at a slight angle to the comb base so that the hair can slide underneath the brooch to the top of the comb keeping it secure.  Jewels are in excellent vintage condition with all rhinestones present, accounted for and brilliant.  Though these have SO much sparkle, the jewels have mellowed just a tad creating that softer authentic antique look and feel that can only be achieve with age.  That feel just can't be replicated by the new vintage ""style"" pieces.   (Note the last photo is showing a similar pair of combs (but not as large or nearly as beautiful ;-) being worn by a model to give you an idea of how they could be used.)   Why settle for vintage ""look"" (that always looks like a reproduction) cookie-cutter produced when you can have designer, one-of-a-kind hair combs made from true antique/vintage jewels??? 
* Your jewel will arrive wrapped in tissue inside a gift box.

.................... PLANTING SEEDS .....................
We make all of our paper fresh to order and seed are specially-selected for their desirability. Our special mix of premium garden flower seeds is a mix of zinnia, pink cosmos, snapdragons, columbine, red and pink poppies, white shasta daisies, cornflowers, calendula, dianthus/Sweet Williams, marigolds and other desirable flower seeds as available. Both annuals and perennials are included.
Our seed paper keeps for 12-18 months and longer when kept dry and out of direct sunlight. Other seed paper on the market, typically factory made, contains too many cheaper type seeds that are essentially lower quality 'wildflower' and grass-like seeds. They sound similar but they are not. For example, there are many kinds of daisies. A popular one in other seed paper is the English daisy, it grows 5-8 inches tall, typically among lawns like dandelions. Our shasta daisies are the classic big white daisy. They grow 3 feet tall and come back year after you so you can make cut flower bouquets with them. Sweet alyssum/baby's breath is another popular seed in lower quality seed paper. It behaves like a weed and can cause itchiness when pulling it. It is banned and unwelcome in many places.
Our premium flower seed mix contains common and desirable garden flowers. They include annuals, for first year color, and also beautiful perennials for blooms in the years to follow. Planting instructions are included. Our plantable paper really does grow - that's a sprout growing right out of the plantable paper in the photo at the right! Growing is simple but not foolproof. Plant 1/4"" under fertile soil in warm sunlight and keep wet to grow. The growing seeds will need proper care, just like other seeds.

10515,54-62 Fender Stratocaster in Gold Metallic Waterslide Decal,"
            Note: You receive two decals with two each on them, for a total of four in each order.
Custom Restoration decals. Micro Dry ink that is waterproof and non smearing. With your order you will receive two decals and a practice custom shop decal. Ever tear a decal, lacquer not just right for your project? then another five day wait, I was that guy. Just one of the reasons I always include a second decal with every order. I recommend watching online tutorials on the installation process and have personally found it very helpful. I always try and ship nightly. Please consider using Micro Sol and apply your decal on a glossy finish, this will help prevent silvering, Instructions for Micro Sol products are available on line as well. Micro set replaces using a few drops of water and helps the decal adhere to the surface. Micro Sol is applied after the decal is dry and smooth by dabbing lightly with a tissue. I have been using a small very soft paint brush to liberally apply Micro Sol and leave it wet to dry. It does a great job in thinning out the edges and melts the decal to the surface for a lack of a better word. My experience with these products have allowed me to be very content with the on top application and a quick coat of any clear just on the decal to protect it. Fender has used this application on the SRV signature version but with their new Decal design.
There are to many variables to guarantee your results, Like anything else the more prepared you are for your project the better the results, I posted a tutorial link below that I liked better than some. I will be posting a video soon of my own application and some techniques that customers have shared. 
* Decals images above are less vibrant and not as clear as in hand. I am working on improving the image quality especially for mobile apps. Decals are printed with Metallic and Dye Sublimation inks and are water proof, smear proof inks. No laser or lacquered inkjet used.                      
                               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkawGOSFjWQ
Applying and cutting Waterslide Decals:
Cut your decal(s), trimming as closely as possible to your printed image. Place the decal in a bowl of luke warm water for about 20-30 seconds until the decal will slide onto your work surface, I have been taking it out and removing any excess water and leaving it sit 10 seconds. You can test if its ready by lifting it, from the bowl and moving it between your thumb and finger to see if it slides, . Place decal edge to where you want it and slide the underside away from the decal. Make sure your surface is a little wet, (couple drops smoothed out with your finger) to much will not allow the decal glue to adhere properly, use either water or a wetting solution such as Micro Sol or Micro set. Please allow a few hours to dry. Apply your first coat of your favorite lacquer.        ",12.99,4.8211,"Handmade item

The forks are gold electroplate (typically over stainless steel). Many of the gold-plated flatware pieces have never been used (new old stock), while others have been gently/rarely used. 
➽ Please note that many gold-plated fork patterns were produced for major silverware manufacturers in China or Korea. The back of each fork handle may be blank or may be marked with ""WM. ROGERS & SON ©"" and ""CHINA,"" or ""Cook's Essentials™ 18/10"" and ""CHINA,"" or just ""CHINA,"" or just ""KOREA,"" for example.   
❤ ❤ ❤ If you would like to purchase a gold-plated dinner or dessert fork set but want to CHOOSE the pattern of gold-plated fork yourself, there will be an additional 5.00 charge. Please convo me to set up a custom order listing which must be purchased *prior* to our review of the multiple gold-plated fork patterns I have in stock. I have patterns with handles that have space for stamping something short (e.g., as shown here) as well as patterns with detailed, decorative handles that cannot be stamped (e.g., only can stamp below the fork tines). 
➽ The gold electroplating on some of the forks shows some light wear (whether from storage or mild use or both). The forks remain in very good condition for their age. However, as these are used or ""new old stock"" pieces, they can show small scratches, dings, and heel wear (i.e., where the back of the fork rests against the table or is stacked on top of other forks in the storage case). 
💕 💕 💕 The forks were extremely difficult to photograph due to the shiny gold plating. I can share additional photos of the pictured forks, if desired. Just convo me. There is no discoloration, or toning, or pink/brown/white areas --- those are simply shadows and reflections from the photography process.
➽ Because of the sensitivity of gold-plating, I will *NOT* darken the letters and/or numbers stamped on the forks. With the base metal being stainless steel, it cannot be darkened via natural oxidation anyhow, leaving only paint or permanent markers to color in the stamping. Paint and permanent markers are *NOT* safe for consumption, despite being labeled as ""non-toxic"" (see more info. below); those materials are non-toxic under ""normal"" use which does not include eating them / putting them in your mouth. 
💕 💕 💕 Therefore, although the letters, numbers, and/or characters may APPEAR to be darkened in, they are NOT -- those are simply shadows from the photography process. The deep, hand-stamped  impressions are permanent and are visible to the naked eye.
➽➽➽ Please allow 5-7 business days for production (prior to Priority Mail shipping), whether or not you want to add the wedding/anniversary date below the tines. This production time does not include weekends or holidays. Therefore you can expect your forks to ship about 1-1.5 weeks AFTER your purchase is completed. I do have a few pre-made wedding fork sets available in my shop that are ready-to-ship, but the rest are custom handmade to order once an order is placed.

➽➽➽ Effective 5/1/2015, AmySueCrafts will be open for orders Tuesday through Saturday (closed for ordering on Sundays & Mondays). Please check the message on my home page for any scheduling changes.
❶ The gold-plated forks will be hand-stamped with ""MR."" on one fork  and ""MRS."" on the 2nd fork. 
-------------------------------------------------------------
◆ The forks pictured have the ""MR./MRS."" stamping done on the handles, but you can select whether you want the ""MR./MRS."" stamped on the handles or below the fork tines. 
◆ And if you also want the wedding or anniversary date stamped, the ""MR./MRS.""  can either be stamped on the handles (because the date is too long to stamp on most handles) OR can be stamped below the tines with the date (in 2 rows with the ""MR."" or ""MRS."" stamped above the date). 
◆ The stamped lettering/numbering will not be darkened in but is clearly visible. 
◆ The letters are stamped in all uppercase and are in a newsprint/block font style. 
◆ If you prefer all lowercase letters or different stamped text (e.g., bride / groom, HIS ONE / HER ONLY, forever / always, A❤B, or X&X), please CONVO me to set up a custom order listing. No other stamping options are included in the price of this listing.
❷ ""Add Date Below Tines"" -- If you are interested, I can hand-stamp the wedding or anniversary date below the tines of the fork (on the fork bowl, as pictured). From the drop-down menu above, please select from the following options:
-----------------------------------------------------------
➽""No Date"" = the date will NOT be stamped below the fork tines
➽ ""Add Date XX.XX.XX"" = the date will be stamped below the fork tines
◆ The date format will be ""MM●DD●YY"" (2-digit Month ● 2-digit Day ● 2-digit Year) format unless otherwise agreed upon prior to purchase. The date will *NOT* be darkened in. 
◆ Please specify the date you want stamped, if applicable, in the ""Notes to AmySueCrafts"" box at Checkout. This image shows where to specify your custom details during checkout: 
https://img0.etsystatic.com/038/0/5763117/il_570xN.619017506_ix2i.jpg
🌟🌟🌟 NOTE: These photos are close-up pictures of the forks. Please remember that as we age, our vision typically declines. Some people celebrating their 50th wedding anniversaries MAY not be able to see the stamped date or letters. I can stamp the numbers in the date using a LARGER font size so that the numbers are bigger. The handles are too small to stamp the MR/MRS any larger, though. Just let me know at Checkout if you want the DATE LARGER.
❸ ""Where Stamp MR/MRS?"" -- From the drop-down menu above, please let me know where you would like me to hand-stamp the ""MR."" and ""MRS."" either below the tines of the fork (on the fork bowl) OR on the fork handles. 
----------------------------------------------------------
◆ ""Below Tines"" = Choose this option if you want to have the ""MR."" and ""MRS."" stamped below the tines of the fork (on the fork bowl) instead of on the handle (and you are NOT adding the date).
◆ ""On Handle"" = Choose this option if you want to have the ""MR."" and ""MRS."" stamped on the fork handles (whether or not you are adding the date).
◆ ""Below Tines w/Date"" = Choose this option if you are adding the date below the forks tines, and you want to have the stamping done in two rows below the tines with the ""MR."" and ""MRS.,"" respectively, stamped on the top row above the date. This would look similar in style to another one of my stamped fork listings shown here: 
https://img0.etsystatic.com/062/3/5763117/il_570xN.756837682_iy35.jpg
 
➽➽➽ If you want to temporarily darken in the stamped characters (e.g., for photos), you can wipe a small amount of black food coloring paste, gel, or liquid into the stamped characters using a soft cloth, gently buff off the excess, and allow it to dry slightly. You can also use a black food coloring pen (often used to decorate cakes and cookies) to color in the stamping. However, *BE SURE* to hand-wash & dry the forks afterwards to remove the coloring, or the black coloring will get on your mouth and tongue while you eat with the forks.
Any slightly blue, pink, brown, or other color of reflection appearing on the silverware in the photographs is simply that -- a reflection. There is no coloration on the silverware itself (besides the gold electroplating). Again, I do have additional photos of these specific forks that I can share with you via convo, if interested. These forks are very shiny, so they were difficult to photograph.
♥ The forks pictured are examples only. Yours may come from one of the same patterns or from a different, equally elegant pattern, depending on availability at the time of production. 
♥ Convo me if you would like to set up a custom order for different custom stamping (e.g., ""BRIDE/GROOM"" or ""HIS/HERS"" or ""HUSBAND/WIFE"" instead of ""MR./MRS."" below the tines) or the addition of stamped characters such as a heart or cross.
♥ These forks are safe to eat with but can also be used as photo props.
♥ This set of forks comes packaged in a silver foil gift box ready for gift giving.
♥ The forks come with instructions on how to care for the gold electroplate finish.
♥ Shipping is via USPS Priority Mail Small Flat Rate box, which includes up to 50 insurance plus Delivery Confirmation.
♥ The two forks will be polished to as bright a shine as possible. The forks will likely show some wear due to their previous lives, including a few small scratches, dings, storage wear, and/or some plate-wear. They do not show substantial plate loss or damage.
➽➽➽ If you would like a variation on this listing, please convo me about setting up a custom order. I have a large selection of gold-plated dinner and dessert forks in stock. I can stamp words on the forks below the tines (e.g., bride/groom, mr./mrs., etc.). I can stamp on the fork tines themselves in some patterns. I can stamp other information on the fork handles (e.g., wedding date, bride's/groom's name, last name, etc.) of certain patterns, too. I can also stamp 2 rows of text below the fork tines on some styles of forks. The possibilities are endless!
★★★ All GOLD ELECTROPLATED silverware items designed for use with food do *NOT* have the hand-stamped letters, numbers, and/or design characters darkened in due to the sensitivity of the gold electroplating and due to the base metal (which typically is stainless steel and can therefore only be darkened in using NON-food-safe substances). However, the hand-stamped impressions are visible and will last forever. (See more information below.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please carefully review ALL of the below information prior to placing an order:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What Exactly is Vintage/Antique GOLD-PLATED Flatware?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This means the flatware pieces are previously used (or are ""new old stock"" [unused but may show storage wear]) and can include nicks, plate-wear, and/or scratches. Each piece is thoroughly cleaned and inspected by me. I personally select each piece for its elegance, design, charm, and beauty. Only the best pieces are used for my projects. There is great beauty in old flatware. Pieces may be tarnished and slightly worn from years of loving use, but reviving them and giving them a new life is a fun way to reuse and recycle as well as to enjoy their vintage charm and history.
GOLD plating (electroplating) on antique flatware varies in color, thickness, and patina between pieces (and even within patterns) depending on the original design as well as how much each piece was used in its previous life. Because of the age and history of my flatware pieces, imperfections are to be expected and cherished -- that is part of their charm and character.
If you are seeking flawless, uniform, modern pieces for your stamped flatware, you have come to the wrong place. You would be better off looking for stainless steel, new, and/or engraved pieces. 
2) How Should I Care for my Vintage GOLD-PLATED Flatware?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please hand wash your GOLD-plated flatware. This will preserve the GOLD electroplating, making the flatware last longer. Mild dishwashing detergent, lukewarm water, and a soft cloth can be used to clean GOLD-plated flatware.
It is normal for GOLD-plated pieces to darken and tarnish over time. Because of the electroplating, there is a risk of chipping the real gold when cleaning the pieces. A little bit of lemon juice or vinegar on a soft, damp cloth can be used to gently removed stains, but be sure to wash off the lemon juice or vinegar immediately when done because the acid can damage the electroplating. More detailed care instructions are included with the flatware.
3) Are the Letters/Characters Engraved?
------------------------------------------------------- 
No, each letter on the flatware is lovingly hand stamped (i.e., hammered by hand by me). I carefully hand stamp each character -- one at a time. Therefore, no two pieces ever will be exactly the same due to the font/pattern used, the precise placement of each character, the character alignment, the depth of each impression, and stamp uniformity. This adds to the character, charm, and uniqueness of the pieces. Engraving is done with a machine, not by hand. 
Because of the nature of hand-stamping, it is impossible to guarantee that 100% of letters/numbers/characters will be perfectly aligned. I am not a machine. In some cases, minor tool markings may be evident on the front and/or back of the flatware depending on the design & thickness of the piece.
4) Why Aren't the Stamped Characters Blackened In on GOLD-PLATED Flatware?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On GOLD-plated (gold electroplated) flatware pieces intended for use with food, stamped characters are *NOT* blackened/darkened in. This is because of the sensitivity of the gold electroplating and due to the base metal of the flatware. 
Most GOLD-plated flatware has a stainless steel base. Stainless steel cannot be darkened in using natural oxidation (i.e., tarnishing). Stainless steel can only be darkened in using NON-food-safe chemicals such as paint or permanent markers. These products may be identified as ""non-toxic"" but are only labeled as such for ""normal"" intended use, which does not include putting the paint/ink in your mouth or eating it.
Although many permanent markers (such as Sharpie® markers) are labeled as ""non-toxic,"" it is misleading. They are ""non-toxic"" in accordance with their intended ""normal use"" purpose of writing, labeling, and drawing... NOT for eating. For example, ACMI certifies that Sharpie® markers do not contain any materials in sufficient quantities to be toxic or harmful to humans. According to the institute's toxicological evaluations, Sharpie® markers are not hazardous under ""normal use"" conditions. However, ""normal use"" does NOT include consuming any amount of the marker ink. This certification as ""non-toxic"" also does NOT mean that materials are not irritants or allergens. Such products are certified by ACMI to be labeled in accordance with the chronic hazard labeling standard, ASTM D 4236, and the U.S. Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (LHAMA). For more information, you can search the Internet on topics such as ""Are permanent markers toxic?,"" ""What does ACMI AP certification mean?,"" ""What is ASTM D-4236 certification?,"" or look up the MSDS for a particular brand of permanent marker. 
And on ACMI's website, it reminds readers (1) not to put your pen in your mouth, (2) to avoid skin contact, and (3) to avoid eating art materials. Moreover, ""never use products for skin painting or food preparation unless indicated that the product is meant to be used in this way."" (http://www.acminet.org/index.php?option=com_safetytips&view=safetytips&Itemid=64)
Buyers are cautioned to consider the health and safety of the intended recipients of their stamped flatware gifts. Sellers who do not disclose the method of darkening the stamped characters on their products intended for use with food may inadvertently be using markers/paints/products that, although possibly labeled as ""non-toxic,"" still could be potential irritants, allergens, or worse.
The stamped characters on my pennies, GOLD-plated and silver-plated garden markers (coming soon), silver-plated jewelry (coming soon), and silver-plated ornaments (coming soon) are colored with a permanent, water-resistant, fade-resistant black dye. Even this ""permanent"" dye will fade over time. However, those products are *NOT* food safe.
5) Please review the information found in the above ""Shipping & Policies"" tab or visit 
https://www.etsy.com/shop/AmySueCrafts/policy
 
★ Please convo me with any questions prior to ordering. I am happy to set up custom orders with different stamped designs (bride/groom, your names, his cake/her cake, I Do/Me Too, wedding date, hearts, mr. right/mrs. right, etc.) and different options (stamping on the fork tines, stamping two lines of text below the tines, stamping on the front and/or back of the fork handle based on the pattern, using unmatched forks, using dessert forks, etc.). 
★ In most cases, I also have matching serving pieces in your same pattern that can be custom hand-stamped as well (serving spoons, meat forks, cake server, butter knife, sugar spoon, tablespoons, teaspoons, and knives). Ask me about the options.

14822,"2 lb. Core Wool Batting For Needle Felting, Wet Felting, Natural stuffing, or Newborn Photos fill cream colored fiber aka Simply Fluff","
            This is some very fluffy wonderful wool batting. It can be used in a wide range of applications and yes, it felts well! 
Other than using this fiber as the ""core wool"" in all of my needle felting kits, I have also used it extensively as a natural stuffing for all kinds of sewn decorations and small toys. If you're making all natural plushies, teethers, Waldorf dolls, etc. this is an excellent choice for filling. It wet felts as well if you are looking to make some toy fruits or dryer balls.  It has also been very popular lately used as a prop in newborn photography.
This is 100% natural wool, in an off white/cream color. The mill tells me it is domestic fiber that is washed and minimally processed. It still smells like sheep. 
This listing is for a 2 lb. roll.  First and second pictures show it taken out of its paper roll. Third picture shows this wool needle felted into a heart.  Fourth picture shows it in its paper roll, which is usually how I ship it and last picture shows it used in newborn photography (photo thanks to Jessica Lacey photography).
If you need smaller quantities, please see the listing for a 1 lb. roll. If you need larger quantities, please contact me for a shipping quote for larger amounts.  I haven't figured out how to have Etsy's shopping cart calculate the correct shipping for multiple rolls.

            Rubber soles for your own felted handmade shoes, clogs and booties. These rubber soles will make your handmade footwear suitable for wearing outside in the Winter. High edges and rubber toes makes felt boots suitable for wet conditions.
Attention! These soles are to smaller size. Choose one size bigger soles, than your usual size. If you make thick wool felt (thicker than 0,6mm) choose 2 sizes up. 
Soles can be glued and stitched to the bottoms of your shoes. It is better to leave this job to a professional shoemaker. Use adhesive for shoes and leather stitching needles. When glueing, put a special cardboard heel pad between the felted shoe and the soles. This is necessary because of the grids in a heel. You can buy additional materials for sole stitching here:
