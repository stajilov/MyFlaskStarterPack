932,"Antique Elks BPOE Calling Card Case Bliss Brothers Co. Hallmark, Fraternal Collectible, Art Nouveau Era, With Hello Card Frame Inside","
            Antique Elks BPOE Club Calling Card Case-Locket, a Wonderful Collectible From the Art Nouveau Era.
The Case Is From The B.P.O.E. Which Is The Benevolent and Protective Order Of Elks Or Elks Lodge.  An American Fraternal Order and Social Club Started in 1868 And Remains One of The Leading Clubs
The Silver-Tone Case Has a Hallmark Inside, A Small Letter B In a Larger B and Co. This Is The Makers Mark For Bliss Brothers Co. Of Attleboro, Ma, A Company In Business From 1896-1950's, The Company Was Renowned For Elegant and High Quality Jewelry, Their Excellent Craftsmanship Evident In This Card Case.
With an Elongated Shape, The Elks Case Has The Most Charming Design on the Front The with a Segmented Design; At The Top and Bottom There Is A V Shape Decorated With The Most Unique Etched Pattern Which Resembles Spiderwebs. On Either Side Of The V Are Bright Cut Flourishes That Add Charm and Interest. 
In The Center Is An Oval Cartouche With The Same Spiderweb Pattern. An Elegant Raised Elk Adorns The Cartouche, With a Cobalt Blue Enameled Clock Resting In It's Antlers. The Enameled Clock Striking the 11 O'Clock Hour. This Stands for the Hour Of Recollection When Deceased Or Absent Lodge Members Are Given A Toast and Bell or Chimes Rang Eleven Times. A Repousse Design Surrounds The Perimeter Of The Card Case.
The Card Case Opens North To South With A Push Tab. Inside is A Great Surprise! The Calling Card Plate Has Open-Work Design That Reads ""H E L L O"" ... Which is So Charming and Whimsical and What Attracted Me To This Case! The Hello Plate Has The Bliss Bros. Hallmark. The Other Side Has The Imprint Of Another Hello and At One Time Held Another Card Plate But Is No Longer Present.
The Back of the Card Case Has A Linear Pattern and The Same Repousse Design Around The Edge. The Case Most Like Hung As An Ornamental and Useful Fob Decoration on a Watch Chain.
This Enchanting Piece Of Antique Americana Is In Excellent Condition For It's Age. It Has Unpolished Patina, Some Surface Scratches Consistent With Age and Use Of A Previously Enjoyed Collectible Piece. The Hinge Is Intact and The Case Closes Firmly and Opens Easily. 
The Card Case Can Be Used as a Locket.. A Great Fraternal Collectible.
Measurements:  2"" In Length (not including bail at top) by 1"" In Width.
Art Nouveau Antique Calling Card Case for Collectors of Elks or Fraternal Memorabilia!

OVERALL HOLLYWOOD WIDTH IS 54"" Inches
HOLLYWOOD HEADBOARD HEIGHT 64"" Inches
 MATTRESS WIDTH : 52 3/4"" Inches
This is a Full Size Bed

 bed rail width extenders,   full to queen size  ( width only) these extensions attached to   2 x 4 
 ( buyer furnishes) will accept your  queen mattress to fit  a full bed for the  width only,

 lumber stores will usually cut to length  If you want this option Contact us (they are 45.00 extra)

ETSY DOES NOT HAVE A COMPLETELY ACCURATE METHOD OF DETERMINING SHIPPING WITH OTHER ITEMS ........MANY OF OUR ITEMS HAVE A COMBINED SHIPPING RATE... BUT SOMETIMES IT IS HARD TO FIGURE WHAT IS AN ACCURATE RATE.. TAKE SUITCASES FOR AN EXAMPLE IF THEY NEST WITHIN ANOTHER....... A BETTER RATE CAN BE APPLIED... BUT IF YOU PURCHASE A BULKY ITEM LIKE A BED....ANOTHER BED WOULD NOT SHIP WITH IT AS THE WEIGHT LIMIT WOULD BE SURPASSED .JUST ASK IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT A COMBINED RATE FOR OUR ITEMS..
@@We have developed methods to extend the rails to fit a queen bed and have created extenders to handle the width of a queen also, this does not affect the headboard or footboard and all the original value of your bed is retained , the Queen mattress will extend 3"" on each side of the headboard....not very noticeable when bedding is applied... we also have a convertible rail that can change easily from full to queen if you want to change back. email if you have questions.
......Our standard shipping method is by Bus, you would need to pick up at the closest bus station (they will call on arrival) , we use bus because it is about half the price of ups and sometimes faster ...but that depends on distance , we have been shipping by Bus for over a year and everyone seems satisfied ...we can check the closest Bus package station for you before purchase if you'd like to know that . please ask questions before purchase .

2256,Gold Fill Padlock Heart Bracelet. Antique Victorian Jewelry. French Murat Style Embossed Curb Chain. Repousse Puffy Heart Charm & Key. Bonus,"
            Fabulous antique gold fill padlock heart charm bracelet is made with beautiful embossed curb chain.  High quality curb chain has attributes of the French Murat Jewelry Company of Paris, with every other link finely detailed, and the backside plain.  Clasp is a lovely floral repoussé padlock heart charm, with its original key.  As a bonus, there is an extra short length of matching chain.  A sentimental and beautiful antique Victorian bracelet to treasure and enjoy for many more generations.
Bracelet and charm are unmarked.  Short length of chain may have a mark on the end link, though it is illegible. Padlock functions as it should.  It is unusual to have the original key, and a small separate pouch will be included, so that you can keep track of its location.  A jeweler could fix a short length of fine chain to the key, though I prefer its original look.  Puffy heart charm features forget me not flowers. 
Surface wear appropriate for its age, c. late 1800’s Victorian jewelry.  A wonderful find, perfect to give as a Valentine’s Day gift.
Your selection will be presented in two tarnish resistant pouches and gift box.
SIZE:  Curb chain = 6-1/2” L x 3/8” W.  Padlock adds another 1/8” to the overall length, so 6-5/8” L.  This would fit a smaller wrist, as is.  Bonus chain = 1-3/8”L and could be utilized by a jeweler to add length, if required.

2910,A Vintage Carved Mother of Pearl MOP AWESOME Moon Button Man in the Moon,"
            This is just such an awesome button, you will love it! Fabulous carved authentic mother of pearl vintage moon or man in the moon shaped button. This button is vintage ""new"" old stock - vintage stock never used. I was able to acquire several boxes of these. No two are exactly alike being that they are hand carved and the colors of the MOP vary some. The buttons take on the natural color of the shells. Some are more white, some have a golden color on them. The carving may vary slightly. Some have a slight arch to them also.
This amazing button measures about 1.5"" tall and about 1.25"" across, with lots of nice carving designs. I have shown with a quarter for size comparison. Great addition to any button collection, wonderful for sewing or crafting or jewelry making with buttons. You are purchasing one Moon button. See last photo for other syles nd our listings for even more!

 INFORMATION FOR  BUYERS:  THIS IS A LISTING FOR COSTUME GRADE,   WE HAVE WORK GRADE OVERALLS LISTED  WITH LESS  WEAR THAN THESE OVERALLS.
*(UPDATE 2017) ""WE DONT HAVE ANY OVERALLS IN SMALLER SIZES""
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.....GETTING A GOOD FIT IN OVERALLS.....
This guide is  mainly for getting a good fit in mens work overalls, we have been selling this  denim item in our store for  over 15 years!     The standard conversion we have used is to take your waist size or jeans  size  and add 2 inches and take your inseam and subtract 1-2 inches, the reason for this conversion is that overalls are  cut with a high waistband and also when you bend and move in overalls you want a little room to move, the reason for shortening the inseam is that overalls  have a much longer stride than jeans so you can reduce the inseam length to compensate for this factor. 
==================================================================
ETSY DOES NOT HAVE A COMPLETELY ACCURATE METHOD OF DETERMINING SHIPPING WITH OTHER ITEMS ........MANY OF OUR ITEMS HAVE A COMBINED SHIPPING RATE... BUT SOMETIMES IT IS HARD TO FIGURE WHAT IS AN ACCURATE RATE.. TAKE SUITCASES FOR AN EXAMPLE IF THEY NEST WITHIN ANOTHER....... A BETTER RATE CAN BE APPLIED... BUT IF YOU PURCHASE A BULKY ITEM LIKE A BED....ANOTHER BED WOULD NOT SHIP WITH IT AS THE WEIGHT LIMIT WOULD BE SURPASSED .JUST ASK IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT A COMBINED RATE FOR OUR ITEMS.
Feedback Policy (Please Read if you would)
We love POSITIVE feedback and we love to give it. We understand that we need to earn it as a seller which is slightly more involved than the click and pay requirements of the buyer. At times we make mistakes but we are ready and willing to fix any problems. Just let us know prior to giving us feedback so we can make it all right and we both end up with POSITIVE FEEDBACK thanks for buying and working with us...

4346,Vintage American Tourister Escort Briefcase Black Hard Shell Plastic with Chrome Metal Latches,"
            Looking for a gift for your favorite hipster executive? Well, I've got just the ticket with this fab vintage 1970s American Tourister brief case. Known as the ""escort"" this is a hard shell plastic case with plenty of room to carry files, papers and even a laptop (but you'd have to add some kind of padding as the inside is also hard plastic). It's in great condition with just a few light scuffs here and there. No cracks or chips in the plastic and the chrome latches are nice and shiny. It's very clean inside - it looks like it was barely used... 
Measures about 18"" wide by 12.5"" high and about 5"" thick when closed.
All sales are final, so please ask any questions prior to purchase and I will gladly and promptly reply. Shipping is for the continental USA only please. I'm not looking to profit on the shipping, just cover the cost and make sure the item is insured for your protection. I estimate shipping based on worst case scenario to cover costs from shipping here in MA to CA. Any shipping overage of 2 or more will promptly be refunded. If you are outside of the continental USA, please convo me for shipping quote.
I'm always happy to combine shipping if you are purchasing multiple items, so just ask!

A bit about reserving Items. I am more than happy to reserve an item for you. However, recently, I have had buyers request to reserve items, only to back out at the last moment. (This has happened with at least the last 10 people who have requested to reserve an item.) While I understand that things do come up and do happen and that money is tight, this is not fair to other buyers or to me. To save time as well as hassle, I have some new policies regarding reserves.

            Vintage flapper mesh bag with rare opening. Has peach flowers and green leaves on both sides.
It is not marked Whiting and Davis or Mandalian. It is marked Pat Applied For on the opening. I have not seen another opening like this one, truly one of a kind.
The opening is silver and very tarnished. I will let the buyer clean it up.
I find this to be in near mint condition. I do wonder if some of the hanging chains at the bottom are missing, but we'll never know.

7527,Organic Hemp Wash Cloth Cotton Fleece Washcloth Baby Face Family Wipes Bath Super Soft! Eco Friendly 6 x 6 size Cloths,"
            Multipurpose 100% Organic Hemp Cotton Cloths
Hemp is a wonderful fabric that can be used for multitude of products, from clothing, nursing pads, in cloth diapering, to bath and body products such as washcloths and cleansing pads. It resists microbial growth (mold & fungus), so it is great for sensitive skin. By using products made from this material you not only limit the disposables that go directly into the landfill, but also support sustainable farming where there is no need for pesticides and herbicides. And hemp products are very durable!
These cloths are 6 x 6 inches and are made out of one layer 100% organic hemp cotton blend fleece. This fabric has a luxuriously soft side to pamper yourself and your skin and a jersey side for tougher jobs (i.e. when you want to exfoliate).
Choose from a single cloth to different size sets in a variety of trim colors. If you would like a set with more than one color, please choose ""variety of colors"" option and specify which ones you would like at time of purchase.
These are great as baby wipes, face cloths or multipurpose washcloths for the whole family.
Eco-friendly and reusable! They will get softer with each wash.
If you would like these serged with a color thread that is not listed, please contact me.
Thanks for looking!

Shower Bombs are a great way to add a variety of fragrances to your shower for an Aromatherapy Experience.  Place the Shower Bomb on the floor of the shower opposite the shower head so the stream and shower mist gently hit it.  Enjoy.  (You can also use these in your bath).
Tips for a Better Aromatherapy Shower Experience
by Spa Girl / Organics by Spa Pure
Allow the shower to run for a bit and let the bathroom fill up with steam. This allows the essential oils that are released to hold in the air better. Place shower bomb OUT OF the direct stream of water; I place my Shower Bomb off to the side so it is getting water on the bottom but not being ""rained on"" by the water from the shower head. This will make for a longer-lasting experience.  I even move the Shower Bomb around with my foot adjusting how quickly it dissolves. All you need is a little water running under it to slowly release the aromatherapy fragrances.
Each Shower Bomb is 1.6 ounces (enough for several short showers or one to two long 20 minute showers).  Each shower bomb is wrapped in colorful foil and all are placed in a large cello bag with hang tag including ingredients and essential oil description with benefits.  Please select ONE FRAGRANCE from the drop down menu and include note with your order for the other blends you would like.

8214,Walnut Cylinder Pendant Lamp - Wood Pendant Light - Brass and Walnut Design,"
            WALNUT CYLINDER PENDANT LIGHT by WILBUR DAVIS STUDIOS
Modernity with a touch of warmth.  That's what we love about working with wood!    This unique pendant light makes a wonderful addition to any room.   Hang a few above a kitchen island, or over a dining table.  Maybe one over each nightstand in the bedroom?  It's a simple and versatile design that works well to bring focus to a smaller area in a larger room.
We make each shade by starting with a solid walnut blank.  We remove the corners to make an octagon shape. Then, to finish up the perfect cylinder, we turn it on the lathe.  Hollowing out the middle to create the bulb chamber and cable routing is the last step.  
Each walnut shade is finished with oil and wax.  The finish highlights the the luster of the wood grain and gives a wonderful satin finish.
DIMENSIONS
The cylinder shade measures 9"" high x 3.65"" diameter.
The brass bonnet for the ceiling is 5"" diameter, 1 in deep.
4’ black fabric-covered cord is included.  
INSTALLATION AND ASSEMBLY
This pendant light kit includes everything you need to connect it to your electrical box on your ceiling.  If you are unsure about how to install a light fixture, please consult an electrician. The included lightbulb is a PAR20, 50W Equivalent LED, which uses 8W.

9375,Crystal Clear Acrylic Lightsaber Stand with Engraved Text,"
            It is important to note that the Lightsaber as shown in the pictures is not included. This is a Crystal Clear Acrylic Stand with Laser Engraved Text that should be compatible with any Lightsabers.
The width of the stand is 19 cm. You can choose to have the cradles at both sides the same height, or to have one side slightly higher (6 mm higher) than the other. It is recommended that you choose the cradle height option 'Uneven' if you planned to use the stand for Graflex, or if you planned to display your Lightsaber while the blade is inserted. For Lightsaber that has (or mostly has) consistent OD, you might want to choose the option 'Even' to have your hilt displayed properly on the stand. For 'Uneven' option it is by default higher on the right side. Send me a note if you want the left side to be higher instead. 
Please also note that due to all the options available for this stand, this is a made-to-order product which requires 5-11 days lead time before they are ready to ship.
All the stands are tested to fit properly prior to shipping. When assemble your acrylic stand, do not put too much force into inserting the plaque inside the cradles. The cradle is made to fit either sides of the plaque , not both. If it is too tight or too loose, try inserting that side of the plaque inside another cradle. The best way is to lay the cradle flat on the table, and try to insert the plaque by pushing it down inside the cradle vertically. If you break your stand while assembling it, I will take no responsible in replacing it for free. All the stands are cut precisely for its cradles due to the possibility of thickness differences of Acrylic sheet, hence the cradles cannot be switched with cradles from a set of another stand. If you need a specific side of the cradle to be higher than the other, please make a note while making the purchase to let me know. Otherwise I will choose for you as I see fit.
Your item will be shipped with Thailand Post track & signed standard international shipping. If you live in the US, it should take around 13-21 days to be delivered. You can trace your package via Thailand Post website 'http://track.thailandpost.co.th/tracking/default.aspx?lang=en' and when the package leaves the country, you will have to trace the item on your local post website using the same tracking number.

            This is another of the small box cameras. this one is the earlier version. It is stamped Occupied Japan and it does not have a viewfinder. It measures only 2.5""tall x 13/4"" wide x 3"" deep. It is worn and shows its age but is still very nice. The box appears to be hand made out of very thin paper of some sort it is unusual, but unfortunately it has been written on several times. These are rare cameras I've seen two in 30 yrs of collecting and I bought them both. If my information is incorrect I hope someone can fill me in. 
This is a must have of any camera collector!
This camera and the ones to follow are great displays. If you could find the film they probably all would work, but none of them (unless noted) have been film tested.

13244,Long Hooded Cape Wool or Velvet Bridal cape,"
            This is the extra long version of my snow queen capes. The hemline flows from roughly 36 inches in front, to 45 inches at the center back. Available in 100% wool, wool/poly gabardine or velvet, with a satin or fleece lining of your choice. (please leave me a note about the lining color - almost all colors are available. If no note is left, I will use the same as the exterior) 
Cloak is not a full circle, and is meant to lie open to show what you are wearing underneath. Closes at neck with a clasp. A ribbon or is frog available on request (leave a note if you want that).  This can be made in almost any color combination, just convo me if you'd like something not shown.
The white velvet is rayon/silk and I recommend going with a very light color lining, as it may show thru otherwise. The cream velvet is a very fine cotton velvet, while the red and black are available in either rayon or cotton. (please specify. the cotton velvet capes are the standard length, but the rayon/silk velvet capes are only 40"" in the back due to differences in bolt size)
If you have any questions about fabrics, just send me a message =) Photos in order are
1) cream wool with dark gold lining
2) white velvet with white lining
3) alpaca with blush pink
4) winter white with ivory cotton lining
5) dark red wool with red lining and cream wool

Thanks for your understanding.
Please dry clean for best results.
For other variations, longer or shorter lengths, other fabrics, or full length capes with a train, either check my other listings, or just send me a convo. and I'll create something just for you.

17627,Copper Hoop Earrings With Sterling Silver Ear Wire - Horseshoe Hoop Earrings - Rustic Jewelry - Hammered Copper Earrings - Oxidized Copper,"
            Copper and sterling silver hoop earrings are a great pair of mixed metal 1-1/2"" earrings.  The hammered texture lends a rustic and casual appeal; wearing an item like this artisan crafted pair is like wearing a piece of unique art.  
Made to order - Please allow 1 week for production prior to shipping.
I make most of the components for the jewelry I sell in my shop from raw materials. This advantage makes design changes possible.   If you want slight changes in size, etc., please send a message to inquire prior to purchase.
The metal wire was forged or bent to shape and hammered on an anvil then manipulated to form the section where the sterling silver ear wire is attached.  All edges were filed smooth. I oxidized (antiqued)  the earrings and tumbled them to work harden the metal and give them a polished finish. They will be treated with lacquer unless you request them to be left natural with a wax finish.
The earrings in the photos measured 1-1/2"" (3.2cm) long measuring from the top of the ear wire. They are 1-1/16"" (2.7cm) wide.        ",29.95,4.9153,"Handmade item

Créé en 2012, la marque Française LADYGUM designe des bijoux en utilisant la gomme de silicone alimentaire, la même que vos ustensiles de cuisine !
Le choix de la gomme du silicone alimentaire n’est pas anodin : cette matière permet en effet d’obtenir un bijou sans métal, qui ne rouille pas, qui ne verdit pas la peau.
En outre, elle minimise tout risque d’allergie !
La gomme va dans l’eau, résiste à la chaleur, au froid et ne change pas de couleur.
Les bijoux sont ultra légers, résistants, doux et très agréable à porter dans n’importe quelle situation : à la piscine, à la plage, au resto et au boulot...
À mémoire de forme, ils se glissent dans votre poche sans jamais se déformer ou s’abîmer !
C’est ce qu’on attend toutes d’un bijou,non ?
Alors à chacune son LADYGUM, rock, contemporain, romantique, baroque, ou glamour, mes bijoux s’accorderont à toutes vos humeurs...

The Sparkle nipple rings are high quality handcrafted sexy nipple jewelry in Solid Sterling Silver and Swarovski crystals.

All silver components in these nipple rings are Sterling Silver and Fine Silver and is not comparable to silver tone, silver filled or silver plated jewelry, it is designed to last without the finish wearing off.  The silver can be cleaned with a silver polishing cloth or silver jewelry cleaner.   
Sparkle nipple jewelry features Swarovski pearls in light creamrose that dance beneath a cascade of Swarvoski Bicones Crystals in clear and crystal AB.  The nipple charms are attached with two sterling silver chains that gently sway with your every move.
These breast adornments are so comfortable to wear. You simply place the loop around your nipple and gently pull the larger dangle to tighten the loop. The shorter dangle covers the excess loop. For a different look, use the longer dangle to cover the shorter one.

Let me tell you more about Full Grain Leather:
Full-grain leather is the strongest and most durable leather. Additionally, since the grain is so tight, it resists moisture very well. Over time, full-grain leather will look nicer and nicer and with the exposure in the sun, you will notice a change in the color, a more tan darker shade,which believe me is awesome! Also you may see some variation in the color,some little scars on the leather and fluctuations in thickness,because every piece of leather is unique,and of course every products from ""NICKY'S LEATHER"" is unique!
* 100% Full Grain Leather 
* With superb craftsmanship and materials for withstand for a life!

THE BIG. THE BOLD AND THE MIGHTY. This is what our 'Avaran' collection is all about. Kalating bags are known to have its each bag to be different from the other. But with our new collection, this makes it more apparent. You don’t need to find a scar or a wrong stitch to make your bag unique from the other, Kalating with its ‘Avaran’ collection helps you keep the uniqueness the more classier way. 
What makes our new collection so unique anyway?
It is the magic number 777! ‘Avaran’ collection spoils you with 7 voguish patterns, we vouch to make only 777 pieces (this has got nothing to do with our love for the number 007). Each bag is serial numbered on the inside of the bag, and once the production hits the magic number, that particular design goes to the RIP section. So once a design is sold out it is sold out ! we don’t believe in variations of the same design by size and colour. No same leather on the models at a time. We are not mass producing cows, We are too creative (or may be too progressive) to stop it and move on to create yet another piece of history. 
KALATING STORY:
Our mission is to create perfect urban bags and accessories designed to blend style and value. 
Kalating was conceived in 2008 for the modern man (or the modern woman buying for her man, discerning in his taste and steadfast in his desire for quality. Each one of our bags are individually handcrafted using the finest cowhide resulting in a full grain leather. We believe that simple things are beautiful and to this end, use a natural tanning process that allows the leather’s character to come through. Paint and pigment have no place in our bags. We are passionate and proud of our carefully crafted artisanal product. 
Our name is derived from the language Ullatan, which stands for ‘Continuous Improvement’. We create two new collections a year unwavering in our desire to see a better product for the savvy and sophisticated urban professional. Our products include messenger bags, briefcases, laptop bags and portfolio bags in tan, soft browns and black to inject some effortless style to your day.        ",177.77,4.9613,"Handmade item

20052,"A4 leather folio, personalized folio, A4 folio, leather documents holder, leather folio, leather folder, leather document case, gift for him","
            This US Horween leather documents holder is entirely made by hand in our small studio. There are  no sewing machines or assembly lines involved in its creation. 
It is made from a large piece of the famous Horween Chromexcel leather; a product to last a lifetime! The large piece of leather is hand cut with precision using traditional tools. 
Each hole is marked and punched by hand. The folio is patiently stitched together using strong, waxed thread and needle. 
The edges are sanded to a smooth finish. 
You may choose to keep the edges natural and observe them patina over time, as the oiled texture of lather allows you to do so.  
If not, I can polish the edges using organic leather balm, home made in a small batch. We make the balm with 100% organic ingredients: beeswax, cocoa oil, almond oil and a few other. 
This folio is a great accessory for those days when you need a lighter alternative to the briefcase. It can hold a bunch of A4 files in each of its hand sewn pockets.
It measures  13"" x 9"" (when closed) and 13"" x 18"" when open, cca 1/4"" thick at the sewn edges; and cca 1/2""where it folds in two. 
More than 350 holes were  punched prior to sewing together the leather pieces; the stitches are made to resist for years and have that unicity of hand stitching - something a sewing machine might never achieve. 
CAN BE STAMPED WITH INITIALS
It would make a great gift for that guy who has everything, but needs 'that special thing'; for a lawyer, business man, or, shortly, anyone who has a job that involves writing. 
***** Tracked Postage! *****

*****OUR MATERIALS*****
We use premium full grain vegetable tanned leather to make our laptop bags, which is the leather that is tanned using non-toxic organic barks and leaves over a period of 30 to 40 days (unlike fast-made low-cost chrome tanned leathers that are harmful to health and environment). We source our leather from a reputable US based tannery that focuses on sustainable leather production. Vegetable tanned leather has natural color and earthy sweet smell, and develops a gorgeous patina with time preserving the story of its owner and making each piece truly unique. This means no two laptop bags made by us will be exactly the same!
Vegetable tanned leather, w​ith the right feeding & care,​ ​also has the ability to heal ​scratches (unlike chrome tanned leathers, which, once scratched, cannot be repaired without re-tanning). This ability makes veg tanned leather products much more durable than any chemically tanned leather goods, and keeps them presentable and rich looking for years.
***** ABOUT US *****
We nourish simplicity and elegance in our designs. Mix stunning textures, subtle geometry of shapes, warm loving craftsmanship infused with patience and attention to detail – and that is how our bags are born. Every bag is carefully cut and made by hand in our little art studio, surrounded by Californian sunlight, music, smell of coffee and refreshing greens of our ficus tree. 
Each product is gift wrapped with love and care and shipped promptly around the world. We are available at any time (apart from sleeping!) to answer your questions and help you make the right choice.
