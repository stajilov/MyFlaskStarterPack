90,Vintage Wooden String Puppet,"
            A great continental wooden string puppets made from wood, cloth and felt. The puppet of a little lady with glasses has wool, hand painted, and wooden face, arms and legs (just the hand/foot and half the limb is wood with the rest being cloth) The main body is created with a wooden block and cloth. I love the fantastic shoes constructed from felt with purple laces to finish.
Puppet is in nice vintage condition. There is some age discolouring on part of the lace effect pinny and a small section of string. This is very minor. Love this puppet but I always tangle them and have come to realise that I don't have the patience for string puppets.
Puppet measures: 13"" with out strings (just doll)
Puppet weighs: 260g before packaging        ",19.90,4.9688,"Vintage item from the 1970s

            Craig Wesley & I travel internationally about twice a year and the most stressful part of the trip is usually before we even leave. We have an adorable trouble making basset hound that we have to drop-off at the dog boarders, we come back home to lock all the doors and grab our luggage, check the traffic to see if we need to leave earlier than planned, check a zillion times if we have our passports, and this is all before we even get to the airport. Of course, what's the most stressful part once you're in line to check-in for your flight? Having to find a pen and filing out an luggage tag that always seems to get smudge marks. 
Traveling is stressful enough, why not make it just a little bit easier by having your own personalized leather luggage tag.
Our Leather Luggage Tag is handmade in the San Francisco Bay Area with your choice of American Made Wickett & Craig ""English"" Bridle Vegetable Tanned Leather, the same leather Louis Vuitton uses for straps, or Natural Vegetable Tanned Leather. Each tag is finished off with a simple eyelet and your choice of steel wire keychain or beaded keychain.
Measures 4 inches X 2.5 inches X 0.07 inches thick, excluding key chain.

1509,Vintage Croquet Set in Original Wooden Box / Hibbard Six Person Croquet Set,"
            Wonderful antique croquet set in the original wooden box. This great 6 player set is circa late 1800's to early 1900's and is complete with all mallets, balls, wickets, etc. It comes in the original wooden box that has amazing beautiful old fashioned graphics with the maker, Hibbard (Hibbard, Spencer, Bartlett & Co.), in large stenciled letters on one side. It's in great vintage condition, has honest wear and patina for a game made to be played outdoors, but everything is still solid. Box is a little warped in places from being stored in a garage or barn for years but it is still solid and has acquired a nice deep aged patina to the wood with water stains, etc. Just an amazing overall deep aged patina and look to it that would make it wonderful for a decor piece! Also a perfect piece for a game collection or could still be played! A nice gift for a collector, these really old sets do not come up very often.
Measurements: 34.5"" long x 11"" wide x 5.75"" tall.
Shipping Note: Please note, the large size and weight of this item cause the shipping to be higher on this piece. If your location lowers the price by more that 3.00 (calculated for farthest distance), I will refund the difference.

The song plays all the way through without stopping or getting tripped up and the music box stops when you put the lid back on like it's supposed to. The windup crank for the music box is on the bottom. The bottom of the box is made of gold painted wood, and there are three wood feet. On the bottom there's an engraved symbol, and and a paper label that says the name of the song it plays. 
Size: 5"" in diameter and 3"" tall.

5994,Hermes Scarf: Washington's Carriage,"
            This gorgeous Hermes silk scarf, Washington's Carriage, is in a very patriotic colorway of red, white, blue, gold and beige. Designed by Caty Latham, the scarf depicts the carriage newly-inaugurated George Washington rode in 1789 from Federal Hall, his New York residence, to the Federation's new capital on the banks of the Potomac River.
From Hermes: ""The crowds were ecstatic, and the presidential escort was a fine spectacle indeed. Three years later, in 1792, a watercolour signed by J. Robert Hart gave a carriage-painter’s view of the carriage of George Washington, made in London. The painting is the inspiration for this carré. We like to think that the first presidential carriage, the focal point of that historic day, looked every bit like the one shown here.""
Excellent vintage condition, 35"" square, with no stains, snags or runs, and care tag attached.        ",228.00,4.9811,"Vintage item

12313,Moms Day Sale Gold Dust and Onyx Cuff Link & Stud Set - Circa 1970's,"
            The Competition ""Formal"" Set - ""Gold Dust"" and Onyx Cuff Links and Studs - Circa 1970's
NEW OLD STOCK! Never used.
About Town (The Competition) still carries this set without the black rim on cufflinks.
Cufflinks and studs are made from base metal with a 14k gold electro-plated finish.
Onyx rim on cufflinks (used on sets from 70's thru 90's)
The gold dust is an epoxy mixed with a metal that looks and reflects like gold.
The finish will not tarnish as long as you don’t use harsh chemicals for cleaning, as that will remove the coating that protects the finish. Wipe with soft jewelry cloth to clean!
Replacement cost for the new set without Onyx trim, per The Competition / About Town is 100
Please Note: We use actual product photos in all of our listings
All Sterling and/or gold pieces have been acid (scratch) tested to ensure they are silver/gold, whether the piece is marked or not.
All measurements on small items are taken using a caliper at the widest, deepest, and tallest point on item for overall measurements.

ALSO AVAILABLE IN OTHER COLORS OF SEERSUCKER:  blue, pale blue, grey, pink, coral, green, yellow, lilac, mint and lime green. Check out the ties on their individual pages for more detail and to see photos of the fabric.
Want a different fabric or need a swatch? Send me a message. 
The SELF-TIE cotton blend bow tie has a hook for easy removal that allows the tie to remain intact if you prefer not to tie it every time you wear it. Not tying it every time saves wear on the stress points and makes your tie last longer. 
The tie is adjustable for neck sizes 14.5 -19.5 inches.
Cummerbund lined in  white tone-on-tone scrolled cotton. Elastic adjustable closure as shown in last photograph.  
The tie is hand washable in cold water; simply lay flat to dry, then iron with a steam iron. Press at any time with a steam iron to keep that brand new look. Cummerbund is dry clean only.
I ship USPS Priority Mail inside the domestic US.
If you need expedited processing for a single cummerbund set, I offer a 2 BUSINESS day turnaround for a 35 fee. You can access this service by purchasing it using the attached link and adding it to your cart before checkout:

14111,"Essentials* 3.0 Bullet Journal Stencil, Filofax, Midori Traveler's Notebook, Hobonichi, Erin Condren Planner","
            * * UPDATED 2017 DESIGN * *
A newly calibrated machine, new blades, and a new, sleeker design means this year's bullets are smaller than ever! Check out the photos to see the new sizes and shapes. Almost ALL bullets now fit inside a Leuchtturm1917 dotted box. Huzzah!
----------
This listing is for a handmade stencil designed by Moo and the Boo. 
The icons on this stencil were specifically designed small enough to fit on a single line or within a single dotted box for use as bullets for the bullet journal system. Most thick, rigid stencils you find in stores have large icons that will not fit inside a bullet box. I tried many store-bought stencils but could never find icons small enough to suit my needs. So I decided to make my own.
To maintain the smallest shape possible, tiny bullet icons must be cut on thin stencil film to allow room for the tip of a pen. These stencils are made on 7.5 mil Mylar film. Although this makes the stencil much thinner than most are used to, be assured the stencil is very durable and will not rip or tear. It is super lightweight so not to add bulk to your journal, flexible, and partially opaque so you can position it correctly on your page. 
Tips for best results:
It may take some time getting used to using a thin, flexible stencil because it conforms to your surface, but it gets easier the more you practice, I promise! 
Use a gentle pen stroke with the stencil as your guide for best results. Press the stencil firmly to the page with your hand if you would like to use more pressure with your pen tip. 
This stencil was also designed to fit in the back pocket of most journals like Leuchtturm and Moleskine (4x7 inches). You can also attach your stencil inside your journal with Washi tape. 
Included are weather icons, banners, and other flourishes to be used as page embellishments. These are much larger than the bullet icons and are not intended to be used as bullets. 
Our stencils work best with fine tipped pens like Micron 01, Sharpie pens, or Staedtler Fineliners. Straight tipped pens and pencils (like Bic mechanical pencils) are best suited. Tapered pens like ballpoints and blunt pencils may not work as well with the tiny, bullet-sized icons. Heavy-inking pens may cause bleeding under the stencil, so I like to use the Micron pens, mechanical pencils, or the Sharpie fine point, no-bleed pens. Don't be afraid to touch up the icon using freehand to get it just right. 
Dimensions: 4""x7""
Examples of how I use some of the icons:
- 8 water drops for tracking my water intake
- row of squares for tracking goal progress
- envelope for email and other correspondence
- pushpin for saving ideas to Pinterest
- facebook and twitter icons for post reminders
- wine glass for date night
- apple for meal planning
- coffee cup for morning routines and coffee dates
- barbell for working out
- airplane for travel
- dollar sign for financial responsibilities
You can also mix and match the icons to build more complex images. The possibilities are endless!
* This order is for the stencil only. Journal and pens not included. 
** Handmade stencils aren't for everyone. If for any reason you are unhappy with your purchase, you may send it back for a full product refund. Stencil must be in new condition and returned within 30 days of delivery date.

14555,17mm Star Mold Kawaii Embellishment Flexible Food Safe Oven Safe Resin Polymer Clay Candy,"
            This is an adorable mold for use with polymer clay and other things.  It will withstand temperatures of up to 395 degrees giving you the opportunity to bake food or clay in your molds below this temperature.
Multiple castings can be made from this same mold. The mold can be used for pouring practically anything into it. If you are going to use the mold for food products for consumption, do not use the mold for any other purpose to prevent contamination and make sure to wash the mold with soap and water before using it for food applications. Mold life depends on the material you are molding and how delicately you handle your mold.
The actual mold may be slightly different than the one in the photo as this is a homemade item.  If there is dust in the mold do not worry, this will not show up in your cast.  The cabochon is simply for example purposes and will not be included with your order.

14892,addi-Express Kingsize PLUS knitting machine - 46 needles  2 add. Stoppers  5 add. Needles (for Replacement),"
            On request from customers I have created a PLUS set to reduce the shipping costs. In addition to the content of the knitting machine, you receive an additional set of replacement needles and an additional pack stopper (2 pieces).
AND I got this tip from a customer:
...  I have found when I covered the counter (top sides front and bottom) with plastic wrap it works just fine with acrylic. This sure has made using the knitting machine a lot more fun. I hope it will help others also. I am not sure you use the Addi Knitting machine, still I thought you could let other that do use the Addi knitting to give it a try and see if it works for them.   ... (Thanks Carol)
More possibilities, larger items - and even more knitting fun! That is what you get with the addi-Express Kingsize. With its larger diameter you can do even more individual knitting with just a few turns of the hand. Like the addi-Express the Kingsize fixes to the table so that it wonŽt slip away. The yarn (almost all sizes and kinds are possible) can be inserted easily into the circle - and off you go!
    Addi Express King size knitting machine with row counter. This knitting machine is in high demand and hard to get. This is the large size that can knit items in the round and flat panels, such as hats, scarves, blankets, shawls, baby items.. This knitting machine has 46 needles and includes stoppers. Online reviews of this knitting machine have been great.
    Circular knitted items diameter approx. 35 cm - 46 needles
    Plain knitted items approx. 45 cm wide
This item is new, unused and only checked by us. It is an original addi product and not a copy from anywhere.

16463,One Gallon Mead Making Kit With Fresh Local California Raw Honey,"
            Mead or honey wine is one of the oldest alcoholic drinks known to man. It is made from honey and water! It may be still, carbonated, or sparkling; it may be dry, semi-sweet, or sweet.
 Mead is independently multicultural. It is known from many sources of ancient history throughout Europe, Africa and Asia, although archaeological evidence of it is ambiguous. Its origins are lost in prehistory; ""it can be regarded as the ancestor of all fermented drinks,"" Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat has observed, ""antedating the cultivation of the soil."" Claude Levi-Strauss makes a case for the invention of mead as a marker of the passage ""from nature to culture.""
Your Mead Kit will guide you through the ancient art of making this wonderfully delicious alcoholic drink in as little as 3 weeks!
Your Kit includes:
Ingredients
1 lb of Fresh California raw honey
1 pkg of yeast for Mead Making
1 pkg of sterilizing agent for disinfecting and treating the mead
Oak or Fruit Flavoring
Equipment
1 Gal.  Glass Fermentation and Bottling Jug
