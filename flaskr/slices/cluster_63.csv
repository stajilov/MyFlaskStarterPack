1578,"Vintage Wood Bead Hanging Curtain, Beaded Hanging Curtain or Bead Room Divider 1970s Boho Chic Hippie Marvel-Panda Design","
            A vintage Boho Chic Wood Bead Hanging Curtain, Beaded Hanging Curtain, Beaded Curtain, Bead Room Divider, Wood Bead Curtain, Boho Curtain, Or Boho Chic Room Divider. Get your 1970's on with this gem. Fire up the incense and you will be all set. This is a vintage wood bead hanging curtain or room divider likely from the 1970s. Says Made in China on in. I believe this piece may have the image of pandas on it, but that is open to interpretation.
Dimensions: 36 inches across and Roughly 6 feet long, but not every bead string is the same length. 
Condition: Has been gently wiped down with a damp cloth. Beads appear to be a light weight wood that has a rough quality with some scratches and smudges on some beads. Not sure what is original to the piece and what is from use and age. There are a few beads that may be missing or the beads were loosely strung as you can see the string at the top in places. Also a couple beads have pieces that have broken off. The wood shim that hides the strings at the top of the piece is loose and slightly coming out if you pull at it. Overall the condition of this wood bead curtain is good with nothing dramatic or noticeable, but it is a vintage piece that has been used.  Always happy to answer questions or provide additional photos.  
Shipping: I usually ship same day or next day.  I will ship Fed-X Home Delivery if the rate is better or the same as USPS. Will be shipped using recycled shipping materials to keep costs down, and  I am always happy to bundle this item with other items to keep shipping costs down.  I do refund shipping costs if I end up shipping at a cheaper rate and the amount saved is over 5. Also, happy to provide free local Seattle pick up and possibly open to delivery just message me to arrange. Washington State Residents pay sales tax.

            Rugs, blankets, colorful rugs, boho rugs, boho blankets, throws, wall hangings, textiles
Please contact us to choose your frazada from Peru.
Frazadas are incredibly versatile textiles that can be used in countless ways to enhance your home. You can choose to use them as rugs, throws, bed coverings, picnic blankets, or wall hangings – the possibilities are endless!
Our frazadas are mainly sourced from villages around the Cuzco region, approximately 3400 metres up in the Andean mountains of Peru. Using the same techniques as countless generations before them, artisans take about a month to complete just one frazada. Made from sheep's wool and coloured with natural dyes they are luxuriously thick and each one is unique in colour, texture and design, ensuring that no two pieces are the same. 
We work directly with artisan families in Peru so you can choose from hundreds available. Please message us for more information. 
Please note: These beautiful textiles are handwoven in small remote villages using natural dyes. There may be slight imperfections or small marks such as candle wax as some of the artisans choose to weave at night under candle light. We love it when we find these imperfections as it adds character to the pieces, making each one truly unique.
Care instructions: dry clean only
Shipping: Please note that these shipping costs are for standard shipping only. International shipping can take up to 25 business days. If you would like to order express please message us and we can organise a quote for you.

1961,"Vintage Boho Chic Wicker Mirror, Antique Vanity Mirror on Stand, Tabletop Mirror","
            Adorable Boho Chic Wicker Mirror, tabletop mirror, a mirror on a stand that swivels. Fun little Pedestal Mirror that would look lovely on a vanity or dresser. 
Dimensions:  Roughly 17 1/2"" high by 10"" wide. Base is  5""x 5 ""
Condition: This is a vintage piece that shows age. The wicker has aged, and there is some fraying of the wicker and some spots where the natural wicker color has faded. Has a handmade quality and does not look completely symmetrical. The plywood back has a rough edge when you take the mirror out and the hinges and screws show age and rust. Darkening and spots on the plywood back. Base supports the mirror in many positions, but it may not be completely level and could use a felt pad on one side to make it completely level. There may be something loose inside the woven base as it jingles when you move it. Still completely functional and lovely just like to be detailed so no surprises. Please look at photos and I am always happy to answer any questions and provide more photos. 
Shipping: I usually ship same day or next day.  I will ship Fed-X if the rate is better or the same as USPS. Will be shipped using recycled shipping materials to keep costs down.

♥ Vintage Guide
Please remember that most vintage clothing is pre-worn, pre-loved, and at least 20 years old.  Vintage clothing will be more fragile than new clothing, and should be worn, laundered and handled with care so you may love it for many more years to come.   I will always do my best to identify any flaws in the description, but some small condition issues may be missed.  
Like many vintage sellers, I describe my items using the following rating scale:
♥ MINT- No problems, as close to ""new"" as possible for its age. Likely never worn or used.
♥ EXCELLENT - No visible flaws and excellent vintage condition.  Shows normal wear expected for age, but nothing easily visible.
♥ VERY GOOD - Shows normal vintage wear due to age, handling, storage and occasional use.  May have some slight flaws or some minor problems visible,  problems will not detract from the overall wearability or style.
♥ GOOD - Has some vintage wear such as surface flaws, minor stains, missing buttons, small holes etc.  Structure is intact. Problems could be fixed and all flaws will be noted.
♥ FAIR - These items will be available at discounted rates, and if you are creative and up for a project, these are still interesting pieces.  Often sold ""as is"", for the use of the material, repurposing etc.        ",129.00,4.9744,"Vintage item from the 1960s

4330,"Frederick & Nelson Mid Century Clutch Purse, Boho Evening Bag, Straw Clutch, or Wicker Purse","
            Super fun mid century Frederick and Nelson Clutch Purse, straw purse, wicker purse, or Boho chic clutch. Says Frederick E Nelson Made in Hong Kong on the inside of the purse.  Carry a little Seattle nostalgia with you as you sport this adorable clutch from the long gone flagship Seattle department store. While I am not positive when this was made my best guess is likely the 1970's. 
Condition: Some fraying of the straw and one spot where there is a broken piece of straw along the edge. There is a number of visible loose thread ends along the ends and seams on the purse. Inside of the purse has a few smudges of what looks like pen ink. Smells slightly of perfume, but only if you stick your nose right up against the inside of the purse. Always happy to provide additional photos and answer questions.
Dimensions: 12""x 7.5"" x about 1 1/2"" wide. 
Shipping: I usually ship same day or next day.  I will ship Fed-X if the rate is better or the same as USPS. Will be shipped using recycled shipping materials to keep costs down.  I am always happy to bundle this item with other items to keep shipping costs down, and  I do refund shipping costs if I end up shipping at a cheaper rate and the amount saved is over 5.  Happy to provide free local Seattle pick up and possibly open to delivery just message me to arrange. Washington State Residents pay sales tax.

5797,Vintage Haggarty's Easter Parade/Spring Bonnet,"
            ""In your Easter bonnet, with all the frills upon it, you'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.""
Just like Judy Garland's bonnet in the movie Easter Parade!  
This hat is a beige color with a hint of a pink to it. The velvet ribbon is a light peach-pink shade. 
This classy Spring hat will be the hit at your Easter celebration! 
This beautiful hat is 15 1/2 inches in diameter. 
It appears the mesh lining has been cut (I'm guessing 'Judy' had a lot of hair to fit in there), however it doesn't effect the wearing of this beauty! 
*There are some tiny holes in some of the material, overtime with the delicate material it is bound to happen. They aren't visible when wearing, but you can see them upon close inspection.*

6311,Cat toy fishing pole!  The most fun interactive cat toy ever!,"
            This cat toy fishing pole is hands down THE most fun interactive cat toy I have ever used in my life!
  
What makes it so special?  You get to fling the mouse 40 feet across your room and retrieve it back imitating a real mouse cruising across the open room.  My cats go nuts when I start reeling it back then just stop and twitch it.  They go into full on hunt mode with their ears back crouched low to the ground.  They think it's a real mouse!
A few years ago I adopted Simba (pictured above), a 10 year old overweight cat with diabetes.  I changed his diet, started giving him insulin shots twice daily, and knew I needed to get him more exercise.  No matter how many cat toys I bought, he wouldn't play with any of them for more than about 15 seconds.  I even stooped as low as buying a red dot laser pointer; he wouldn't even acknowledge it.  That’s when I made this toy...
I literally have to stop playing with Simba because he starts panting and I don’t want to overwork him!  He’s lost 5 pounds and his diabetes has gone into remission!
The cat fishing pole comes with very detailed, simple to follow, instructions on how to cast the mouse.  Even people who have never touched a fishing pole in their life get the hang of it very quickly!  It also comes with 2 additional mice.  The handle on the reel can very easily be switched to the other side depending on which hand you hold the rod with.
I use a very strong ""braided"" line so they cant bite/claw through it.
You get what you pay for, and with this you get an extremely fun, quality product that you and your cats will not get sick of!
If you would like a few extra mice with your new cat fishing pole check out my other listing below.  Shipping is free with purchase of a new pole!

8270,Natural Deodorant Organic Deodorant Aluminum Free All Natural Deodorant Stick Homemade Deodorant Chemical  Free Handmade Deodorant,"
            WHY NATURAL DEODORANT IS BETTER?
Switching to an all natural deodorant is one of the smartest skin care decisions you can make. 
Conventional antiperspirants and deodorants are filled with potentially toxic ingredients including: 
	•	Aluminum
	•	Parabens
	•	Propylene glycol
	•	Triclosan
	•	Synthetic fragrances
Aluminum, the sweat blocking ingredient found in most conventional antipersirant deodorants, is a known neurotoxin and suspected contributor to Alzheimer's disease, chemical sensitivities, and breast cancer. 
Parabens also appear to be cause for concern. Scientists believe the parabens used in most deodorants and antiperspirants could be responsible for accelerating the growth of tumors in the breast. 
Studies have found that women are eight times more likely to develop breast cancer in the area of the breast closest to the armpit, than in any other part of the breast tissue. Read this BBC report for more information on parabens in deodorant .
Ditching Your Toxic Antiperspirant
Sweating is a good thing. It is a natural bodily function we really shouldn't tamper with. 
To prevent sweating, antiperspirants work by clogging, closing, or blocking pores with powerful astringents like aluminum salts. 
This interferes with the body's ability to regulate it's temperature and eliminate toxins, two very important functions. 
It is also believed that once an antiperspirant wears off, the underarm sweat glands increase perspiration production to compensate. This creates a visious, sweaty cycle we need more antiperspirant to fight.
Deodorants, on the other hand, neutralize body odor while also killing odor causing bacteria. Since they do not interfere with the body's natural processes, deodorants are the better choice. 
The culprit of body odor isn't sweat. In fact, fresh perspiration is odorless. 
However, when our sweat mixes with airborne bacteria - Houston, we have an odor problem!
We can easily prevent body odor by killing odor causing bacteria, and this can be done without potentially toxic chemicals.

9056,"Palm RX Hand Balm for Weight Lifting, CrossFit, Gymnasts, Rock Climbing, Rowing, and Athletes","
            We are excited to announce that Palm RX was recently featured in BuzzFeed’s 27 Must Have Gifts for the CrossFit Obsessed!!!!!
Palm RX is your solution to rips, cracks and all things bad about working with your hands. It helps protect from callus tears, keeps skin supple, and reduces pain and inflammation. Rather than just putting a layer between your skin and the bar like wraps or gloves, Palm RX works below the surface to properly hydrate the hands and condition the skin to handle even the most intense training.
Palm RX’s formula is designed for use immediately after activity to reduce pain and inflammation in the hands. Locally sourced beeswax acts as a humectant to draw moisture to the skin, while also providing a water resistant barrier to allow hands to heal. Hemp Seed Oil provides omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and gamma linolenic acid to nourish the skin. Our proprietary blend of essential oils helps soothe pain and inflammation.
Who Needs Palm RX?
Palm RX was developed for serious athletes. CrossFitters, Gymnasts, Rock Climbers, Rowers, and Weightlifters all swear by our product.
How Do I Use It?
Apply Palm RX after you have tortured your hands to reduce the pain and inflammation, and throughout the day to keep calluses hydrated and skin supple.
Palm RX produces high quality, all natural, vegetable based skin care for athletes. Petroleum and paraben free means no nasty chemicals, ever. Palm Rx is extremely concentrated, so a little goes a long way!!
 
Made in small batches in the USA.

11655,"Distressed book set, French country decor, shabby chic, coverless books, set of 3","
            Distressed book set, French country decor, shabby chic,  coverless books, set of 3.
This wonderfully distressed set of 3 books is a great way to display and repurpose tattered books that had ruined covers but beautiful pages.
This listing is for all 3 books, wrapped in jute.  The bottom book measures 8 1/4 inches by 5 1/2 inches. The middle book measures 7 1/4 x 5 1/4.  The top book measures 7 x 4 1/4.  None of these  books have a cover.  The books are in delicate condition and should be used for display only.  The jade horse in the pictures is not included (sorry!).
The coloring of all the book pages is aged tan to off white.  Please see pictures for details.
The bottom book is Texas by James Michener, 1985.  The middle book is Reader's Digest Condensed Books, Volume 3, 1964.  The top book is Chesapeake by James Michener, 1978.  These are vintage, old books.  
This set would look great on a shelf or mantle.  Also would look classy for wedding decor or as a photo prop.  This is the ultimate upcycled book set!
Please check my shop for other sets like this as well...thanks!        ",19.99,4.9855,"Vintage item from the 1970s

            Kodak M12 Movie camera is being SOLD AS IS. It has some tape, which i believe is holding the batteries. I did not take it off or try to do much to the camera. I don't deal much with movie cameras, so it's priced to sell.
this comes with the original box and instructions, so at least you get a good box and original instructions. 
The camera itself may be good for parts, it may be working, I don't know, I didn't test it at all.

16423,Prince Symbol /Pastry/Icing/sandwich Cutter - Three different sizes available - spring offer - buy two get one free,"
            BUY ANY TWO OF OUR CUTTERS AND GET A THIRD FREE!!!
As a special offer you can grab yourself a free cookie cutter - simply order two and choose a third (standard size) cutter from any of our listings - drop us a message along with your purchase saying which you'd like and we'll include it in the parcel we send to you. No extra charge, no extra postage, the third one is entirely free!!!!
Pictured here is our tribute to Prince, a cutter based on his symbol - please note, it may look as though it's the wrong way around but you are seeing a pic of the cutting face so anything you create will be a 'mirror' of this - trust us, it's the right way around :).
The standard size cutter measures approximately 8 cms long and just over 7 cms wide it is perfect for making generously sized cookies which lend themselves to decoration. 
Due to popular demand we also offer two other variations of this cutter in larger sizes, the very large one is 18cms tall and approximately 16cms wide so is great for giant cookies or large cake decorations. There's a medium size at 12 cms tall by 10 cms wide - again, very cool for larger cookies. We've tried smaller ones but they don't really work that well due to the intricate detail in the pattern. 
They are all 15mm deep which means there is plenty of scope for cutting deeper cookies. It's also ideal for creative icing and cake decoration, cutting sandwiches etc
Perfect for making those little treats for yourself or for parties.
All our cutters are made by ourselves in the UK using food safe PLA (a bio-degradable thermo plastic which comes from renewable sources) which is also manufactured in the UK.
All of our cutters are available only from this store are all original designs created by us here in the UK.
The design is well tested and if you look after them, they will give you years of service. The side walls of the cutter are 1.5mm thick so they are nice and strong  and the upper ring which you press on is 3mm wide which makes the cutter rigid and easy to hold/use.
They are not dishwasher/steam steriliser safe as the plastic may well deform at such high temperatures and should only be hand washed - drop them in with the normal washing up and you'll be fine.
As we have been asked several times to make a larger cake cutter for professional bakers and caterers we have now added the 260mm x 220mm a 45mm deep mould - please note that these are perfect for chilled/cold setting desserts but not to be used in the oven. Yes, they are expensive but they take a lot of work and time to prepare and we have factored additional postage/packaging prices into the purchase price- we print them in three sections then assemble them prior to shipping - it's labour intensive and time consuming. The one consolation is that they are truly unique and only available from us and our chosen distributor (a local company to us that specialises in collectible items) who sell our products on ebay 
Please check our other listings for many more of our unique and individual designs. 
We also offer a 'custom' service where you can ask us to create a cutter to your specifications and design - please contact us 
for details. 
This one actually started out as a 'special request' but it's so nice we've decided to add it to our range.
Please note that due to exceptionally high demand for this item we are currently having to specify a 48 hour dispatch time - 
we'll try to be quicker and if your order is urgent please contact us and talk to us before your purchase.
The very very high demand has caused another minor problem so the actual colour of the cutters may vary from the photo - our filament suppliers are low on white so we have switched to light blue for the time being - the actual cutter is no different in size and shape, just a different colour.
