42,"16 Ideal Compo Shirley Temple doll, 1930's Ideal Doll, Antique Doll, Shirley Temple, Vintage Doll, Antique Doll","
            Ideal 16” Shirley Temple from the 1930’s in original costume from the movie, Stand Up and Cheer. The costume is faded and elastic is gone-needs to be laundered by hand. The dress is a one piece with panties included. She still has the “Genuine Shirley Temple doll button, which came with her. She also has the original mohair ringlet wig with original red bow. Face has some crazing and one chip on her left cheek and a very small one on her nose. Eyelashes are perfect. Nice painting on eyebrow, eyelid, and lips. She has open/shut eyes that work very well and beautiful white teeth. She also has a soft blush on her cheeks and her fingertips. 
Her body is in good condition too except that it needs to be restrung and there are some chips at the top of the neck where the head rests. Very little visible crazing (much more pronounced in the neck photo since it is a close up) on body but it shows some discoloration. Also notice she has the original stamp on the back of her upper back. Shoes and socks are original and in excellent shape except they need cleaning as does the rest of her outfit. I also have a hand made dress made for her, which is listed separately. 
This doll was my mother’s who was born in 1922. She was older when she received it so it was used very little and has been cared for by my mother and myself ever since. 
If you are interested in several items, convo me and I will make a custom listing for you with a reduced shipping cost. If you buy a lot and the shipping is too steep, I will reimburse you through paypal.        ",475.00,4.9818,"Vintage item from the 1930s

The object is simple, roll the dice and put together the best poker hand you could. Card values are between 5 and Ace, allowing you to play poker, high/low and lowball. 
The set includes:
5 eight sided dice showing card values.
Black leatherette Marlboro pouch.
Marlboro Poker Dice Game Booklet. 
The pouch and dice are in nice condition. The game booklet is tone in half from bing folded, but still usable.

2244,SALE - Sterling Charm Bracelet - Vintage Unusual Style Bracelet - Shiny Twisted Links - Folded to Make a Double Link - Starter Empty Bracele,"
            This 1960’s beauty is a wonderful example of the wide array of charm bracelet styles there is. A most unusual style is this with the twisted links pinched in the middle and then folded over and interlocked.  Please take a good look at the close up to get the idea of this hard to describe style.
It is marked Ster. on the back of the clasp with a makers mark unknown to me.  The length is approximately 7-3/4"" with the width of about 3/8"" and a light and airy feel to it.
It is in wonderful condition with a bright cheery shine and no issues.  The clasp slides very snugly and is somewhat hard to open, making it secure and it also has a fold over safety for added security.
This is a beautiful, well made bracelet and cab be worn alone as well displaying your favorite charms.

7586,Myrrh Essential Oil - Undiluted Therapeutic Grade          10 ml/ 1/3 oz,"
            Myrrh is the sap or resin from a tree, rather than a true essential oil, and is a smoky mysterious oil with unique healing qualities. The oil is pale to dark amber in color. Some of its countries of origin are India, Somalia, North Africa and Libya.
Usage Directions: Since Myrrh essential oil has a thick consistency, I would recommend placing the bottle in a hot water bath.  Once the oil is back to a liquid state be sure to shake bottle slightly before using. 
Myrrh oil has excellent fungicidal properties, which makes it well used in a vaginal douche against yeast infections, helping to alleviate the symptoms. As an antiseptic and astringent, Myrrh is good for the gums, as well as helping to heal mouth ulcers and other external skin conditions. Its antiseptic properties are also good for helping to treat asthma, coughs, chest infections and bronchitis. It is a great expectorant and will help to dry up excess mucous. It is also reported to have a tonic and stimulating action on the stomach as well as the entire digestive tract and is used as a remedy for diarrhea.
Myrrh blends well with Clove, Frankincense, Galbanum, Lavender, Patchouli and Sandalwood.
Caution: Do Not ingest. Avoid usage in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Height of the doll is 25 cm (9,5 inches).

14090,Calligraphy Starter Kit,"
            TO PURCHASE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ONLINE VIDEO TUTORIAL - YOU MUST PURCHASE THROUGH OUR WEBSITE HERE: http://lhcalligraphy.com/product/calligraphy-video-starter-kit/
Are you looking to try your hand at the art of calligraphy? Or perhaps want to gift your favorite creative gal or guy with the tools they need to explore the art? Our introduction to calligraphy kit, curated especially for beginners by Laura Hooper based on over a decade of experience as a professional calligrapher as well as 3 years of teaching in-person workshops to over 2,500 students, includes the tools you need to start your journey with modern, pointed-pen calligraphy. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, it includes detailed INSTRUCTIONS on how to actually use those tools. This is what sets our kit apart from other ""starter kits"" on the market. There are many kits offered that include simply a pen, nib, ink & an alphabet exemplar, but zero instruction on how to actually use the tools.
The Laura Hooper Calligraphy starter kit walks you through the mechanics of the tools as well as preparation, and then covers the very basics from dipping into your ink, to practicing up and down strokes, pattern formations and then goes into the upper & lowercase alphabet.
Each kit includes {see bottom of listing for NEW intermediate add-on description}:
 
- 1 adjustable oblique pen holder 
- assortment of 3 nibs
- 1 pot of black ink
- 1 pot of white ink
- instructional tips & techniques from Laura's personal experience including 3 alphabets
- 1 journal with gold foil letterpress cover (with quality calligraphy paper inside)
- 3 sheets of vellum tracing paper 
- 3 sheets of gridline practice sheets (additional 24-sheet notepad available as an add-on)
 
 
*Instructional tips for lefties can be found in the ""References"" section at the back of the instructional portion of the kit. These are not created by Laura; they come from an online calligraphy resource to provide guidance for left-handed writing. Left-handed kits will include a straight penholder as they are considered beneficial for left-handers (unless otherwise requested in the notes for seller). Our kits are not geared specifically towards left or right handed calligraphy, regardless of which kit you order.
*Details on the ink & nibs will be included in the kit itself.
*No cancellations or refunds after 2 hours from time of placing the order. If your order has already been processed we regret it cannot be cancelled.
*Please confirm your shipping address BEFORE you hit submit on your order!
*For international orders, please note that we do not have control over any imported goods tariffs that are charged by your home country. The shipping you pay to Laura Hooper Calligraphy covers the cost for Laura Hooper Calligraphy to ship your item internationally. Any charges incurred upon arrival in your country do not come back to Laura Hooper Calligraphy, and we have no control over them. We are legally required to disclose the value of all kits in customs documentation. No exceptions. Thank you for your understanding. Additionally, international orders that are ""missing"" will not be re-shipped until a claim has been filed and Laura Hooper Calligraphy has received reimbursement for the original shipment. 
***DUE TO THE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE LHC STARTER KIT, OUR KITS ARE NON-RETURNABLE AND NON-REFUNDABLE.
*Grid line notepad, jars, and gold ink kits are available as add on options; not part of the standard kit option.
**Alphabet tracing pad is the grid pad with the practice strokes & full alphabet directly on the grid pad for tracing/guided learning of the strokes.
Looking to take your calligraphy one step further? Consider our Intermediate Guide Add-on. This is a sample guide only that includes:
- 2 Flourished alphabets
- a full set of flourishing examples (lower case letters, words & ornamental flourishing)
- a tracing pad with the full flourished alphabet, upper & lower case, for tracing on grid paper
- a few notes on Modern Calligraphy & Mixing Inks
**Please note this is a guide only with samples of intermediate work. It does not include practice paper, supplies, or special instructions on how to get started with calligraphy. It can only be purchased in conjunction with our starter kit which teaches you the basics on calligraphy. If you have already purchased a kit or attended a workshop, please contact  alyssa [!at] lhcalligraphy.com.

            These clip on earrings are handmade from polymer clay and come in a range of beautiful autumn shades. 
Great care is taken in creating each pair, including buffing the clay for a smooth finish. They are a great alternative for ladies who can't wear stud earrings. They are very light and come with rubber padding in the backs, which makes them so comfortable to wear you'll forget you've got them on.
As the earrings are lovingly hand crafted they will have differences in texture, shape and finish, however this ensures each pair is unique.
They measure approximately 14mm across.
