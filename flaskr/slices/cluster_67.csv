1882,Map of France - French map - French school map - French vintage map - vintage map of France - antique map of France,"
            This is an unbelievably beautiful double-sided Rossignol map of France, showing the country's administrative departments on one side and a map of its population centers on the other. 
Given its age, this map is in excellent condition. The edges of these maps are often damaged. This one has been carefully taped by its previous owner - something to note if you prefer that it is ""pristine."" Personally I am grateful for this intervention, as it has kept the map in top condition. The tape itself is off-white and perhaps 1/2 inch wide - it is very unobtrusive.

8661,Bath Shelf - Bath Tray - Book Holder - Tablet Holder - Phone Holder - Birthday Gift - Bath Caddy - Wine Holder - Beer Holder - Caddy,"
            Welcome to Spud's Creative Asylum. 
This bath caddy is perfect for relaxing in the bubbles, with a good book, a glass of wine and some ambient lighting. It can also be used for holding a tablet or smart phone. We have iPads, iPhones and a Samsung smart phone and the integrated steel holder accommodates all of those. 
The book / tablet holder is made from sturdy steel rebar and this is fitted securely into the shelf. The shelf itself is made from reclaimed wood and coated in Danish oil to protect from steam and water and keep this looking beautiful. 
There is plenty of room to hold a bottle of wine and maybe your favourite chocolates. These make perfect gifts. 
Because I use reclaimed wood, every piece will have it's own history, marks, grooves and cuts. Please note that due to the natural markings and grain in the wood, the depth of colour may differ between each one. 
This fits a standard size 700mm wide bath, but I'm happy to make this in various sizes if required. Anti slip rubber feet are also fixed to the bottom of each shelf to stop them sliding.
I can make several variations to this design:
*One wine glass slot 
*One wine glass slot and one wine bottle/ mug / pint glass recess
*Two wine glass slots
*Pint glass / mug recess
Regardless of the design above, each one will still come fitted with the metal book / tablet stand.
This product is made to order, from selecting the wood, cutting, sanding, assembling and finishing. A lot of time, love and care goes into each piece and this is reflected in the quality of the finished product.  
Accessories not included. 
If you like this bath-board then I also offer one in an alternative design without the metal book / tablet holder:

9097,"Kids Behaviour Reward Chart, toddler routine chart, visual aid, ASD, ADHD, kids magnet reward chart, full imagery, picture reward chart","
            Here we have a fully magnetized, fully personalised, fully customisable reward chart for the little angel in your life! This chart is the perfect visual aid for those pre-school children, toddlers or children with SEN, ASD, ADHD, GDD or need that visual aid as oppose to wording on their charts.
How does this work, 
Every day your child has 15 jobs, behaviours or routines they need to adhere to. If they complete their task for the day they would get their magnet to fill the circle. 
You would let your child know how well they are doing so far with the coloured faces. 
Red sad face - not doing so well
Orange neutral face - try harder
Green happy face - brilliant day! 
Whatever face the day ends on would move over to the weekly section on the chart. 
You will see there is a space for their magnet treat of the week. These are also pictures, if they worked hard enough throughout the week they would get their treat (mums discretion of course!)  
The magnets come in any colour and are sparkly. Please do let me know if your child doesn't want glitter 
These charts can be edited at a later date and as a result can grow with the child. Feel free to contact me at a later stage to create a new insert. Or you can find the listing to get your personalised finished chart sent over to your PC in a file here 
https://www.etsy.com/your/shops/OliHarriCreations/tools/listings/240297601
 With this file, your chart can be adapted as many times as you need to 
If this wasn't quite what you were looking for I do offer a variety of Reward chart options which can all be found here

9974,Overwatch Crate | Overwatch Lootcrate | Loot Crate | Overwatch Props | Loot Box | Overwatch Loot Crate,"
            Howdy!
Here we have one of me and my 9 year old nugget's favorite item in our favorite game, the Overwatch Loot Crate!!!!  
Like everything me and my nugget's print, we can print this in any color imaginable if you decide you want it in another color combo different from what is pictured. If we don't have a specific color in stock, well that is what Amazon Prime Same Day shipping is for!  This will be printed in PLA Pro (otherwise known as PLA , or HD PLA), which is a plant based material and will have up to ten times the strength and durability of standard PLA without the toxicity of ABS.
We use high quality printing options with a large infill, so unlike other large 3D printed models that you could blow off a desk, these will have a lot of heft to them.  The size options are below, and we can always set up a custom size (we are capable of printing up to 10 inches tall with this model).  Just leave us a note at order on what color you are looking for.
Size Options:
Mini- 2"" x 2""
Small - 2.50"" x 2.50""
Regular - 3.25"" x 3.25""  (!!!!!!NOTE!!!!   Pictured with the Gunnar computer glasses for reference)
Medium - 4"" x 4"" 
Large - 5"" x 5"" 
XL - 6"" x 6""  (Pictures, this thing is bigger than it looks, and weighs almost 2 pounds. Takes almost 4 days to print!)
XXL - 8"" x 8"" 
Ginormous!!!!!!!  -  10"" x 10""  Now you're definitely looking for bragging rights! This will take an extra week to process the order

11353,Bucket List - Travel Journal - 4.5 x 6 inch A6 - Bucket List Journal,"
            Bucket list journal! A place to list the things you want to do, or record the things you have done.
A6 mixed paper travel journal with a black faux leather soft cover. The inside cover is hand painted with a white and purple checkered design. The small size is perfect for travelling and journaling on the move.  
Over 80 pages of assorted paper. The majority of the pages are unlined and neutral in colour (white, off-white) but vary in texture and weight. I have also included some pink and purple paper to match the colour theme of the book.
You will also find some of these papers added, some full sized pages, some half sized pages, and some smaller additions:
- lined/ruled (vertical and horizontal)
- squared
- manuscript paper (unused music paper)
- textured
- salvaged paper (from reused envelopes)
- recycled elephant poo paper
- recycled bank note paper
- recycled banana paper
- practice writing paper
- cash book paper
- tracing paper
- graph paper
The great variety of paper is what I find most fun about this book. I like to have a different combination of papers each time you turn a page. Some pages are small or torn in half. There's an envelope sewn into one of the signatures (pictured) so you can keep things inside there. There's also a 'mini book' sewn into one of the signatures (pictured).
'BUCKET LIST' embossed sticker on the front.
SIZE: 12 X 16 X 2cm (4 6/8 x 6 1/4 inches) approx.
PAGES: 80 (160 both sides)
Please note that the photos used here are representative of the book you will receive. Each book is unique, and will be very similar to the one pictured.

            PLEASE READ! THIS IS FOR 12-16 INCH NECK MEASUREMENTS. If it's more or less you MUST tell me! If you get this piece wet, clean and dry ASAP as if it cost a lot of money! Maintenance is key for keeping the jewelry looking pristine. The last photo is the gold option. 
I MODEL MY OWN NECKLACES! (NOTE the buttchin and birthmark in the buttchin lol that's me!) so there are no surprises when opening the package, what you see is what you get :) 
The 'Y' Necklace is meant to just hang down the body and the longer dangling strand is about 11 inches long, goes down to about the belly button. Perfect for low cut tops! 
The Y and Waist option is the last photo! Where the material hangs above the waist. Please let me know your Waist measurements before purchasing! 
You can pair that necklace with the accompanying Rihanna Choker in 5 rows. This CHOKER has a beautiful diamond look to it, with its crystals packed much closer together, creating a much more sparkly and diamond look. 
⚡️⚡️NEW and improved!!! I now use clasps that I assure you will NOT break or snap loose! the ring is a 'split ring' which has TWO loops, instead of the ordinary one loop. This is great because it makes the clasp twice as strong and I guarantee it will not break off. 
✨The material comes from the Fashion District  in New York City and I'm in love! I guarantee you will love this too. This is not a mesh ribbon, these high quality rhinestones are affixed onto a silver plating so it will not irritate your neck in any way. ✨
✨The choker can accommodate a neck measurement of 12 to 16 inches .  These rhinestones are unlike other ribbon/mesh material because they actually do shine. ✨        ",21.00,4.8875,"Handmade item

*******************************
What properties does the stone have?
*  JADE is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also a stone of fidelity and generosity. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. It is used in crystal healing for increasing self-reliance. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. 
In Chinese culture, Jade eventually it came to be known as the “Stone of Heaven” and formed the bedrock of their culture. China’s religion, ceremonies, philosophy and art are all closely bound with jade stone. Confucius wrote that jade held all the most excellent qualities that men should aspire to. Yu, the Chinese word for jade stone, took on a larger meaning and was used to describe greatness and beauty. A beautiful woman was known as a “jade woman” and the highest Taoist divinity was referred to as the “Jade Emperor”.
