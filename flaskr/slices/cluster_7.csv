            I am in love with these vintage Swarovski stones! Each stone is genuine vintage glass (NOT acrylic) and has been hand-set into a four prong brass setting. I've then hung them from vintage brass leverbacks. I've added a patina to each of the raw brass settings and sealed them with renaissance wax. Each stone has amazing clarity for being 50 years old and features the depth and cut Swarovski is famous for. Each stone measures 12 x 10 mm in size. Total earring length is 1 1/4"".
**I did my best to capture the sparkle and beauty of these stones. They have amazing sparkle that rivals a brand spankin' new rhinestone, let alone one made 50 or 60 years ago! You won't be disappointed!**        ",18.00,4.9183,"Vintage handmade item from the 1940s

1007,Silver ethnic tribal earrings Middle East Afghan jewelry Kazakh Vintage hippie Nomad earrings gypsy chandelier earrings bellydance dangles,"
            Silver ethnic tribal earrings  - Middle East exotic style, Afghan jewelry.
Kazakh Vintage item from the USSR time, was brought from the Republic of Kazakhstan in the 70s. Kazakh ethnic jewelry has alot in common with Afghan jewelry, because these countries are neighbours. Kazakhstan has been culturally influenced and inspired by Afghanistan.
Even the factory made jewelry of the 70s has this special ethnic vibe.
These intriguing hippie Nomad earrings are 38 mm long from ear hole to the bottom.
The chandelier part has 5 Eastern bell dangles. It measures 18 mm in width at maximum.
The dangles are 6 mm long. Please see the closeup photo 4.
These bellydance dangles have beautiful stamping on both sides, so tha back of the earrings is as pretty as the front ( please see the photo 5 )
These gypsy chandelier earrings securely close on the back side with Englih type leverback closures. The type of closure and the stamp on the back side allows to date these earrings as a piece of the 70s ethnic jewelry, probably made by a small factory. The method of electric silver plating was successfully used by USSR jewelry manufacturers in the 70s, and this jewelry really lasts for ages.

There is no indication of a maker on it.  It shows different switch settings for the cam number to produce various stitch patterns.  
It is warped a little, but moves freely.  There is a crack in one of the windows and two cuts on the outside of the wheel.  It will be mailed in a box for protection.

 I do believe this is hand made.

3526,Vintage Pink Baby Coat and Bonnet Set,"
            Someday, your baby will look at you and say, ""Mommy, I want to be Jackie O.""  And  you'll have to run out and find her a coat exactly like this one. Why not just buy it now and have it ready? :) 
This adorable pink coat and bonnet set is labeled - ""An Original Kate Kiddies Classic"" inside the coat. I bought this in a lot of items at auction and spent a great deal of time cleaning it! It's a nubby sort of material - the label doesn't say what kind - with what appears to be a cream satin lining. 
Overall, both coat and bonnet are in good condition. The coat is faded unevenly, as you can see in the photos, and may still have some stains on the inside (and I think there are a couple of tiny ones on the back of the left shoulder as well). It also seems to have a few moth holes. I can provide more photos if you'd like. The bonnet is in good vintage condition - it seems to be much closer to the original color. 
Measurements:  neck is 13"" in circumference; 13"" from collar to bottom of coat; 11"" across the front from sleeve to sleeve. Sleeves are 8.5"" from shoulder to cuff. 
I'm happy to answer questions, provide more photos, and combine shipping on items. Thanks for visiting!        ",18.00,4.8413,"Vintage item from the 1950s

3667,"Suit 44R Seersucker HOLT RENFREW Suit 44"" Chest, 36"" x 29"" Pants Made in USA for Holt Renfrew Men's Blue 44 Seersucker 2 Button Summer Suit","
            This is a really nice, American made, and very lightweight, summer suit.
Holt Renfrew is a respected seller here in Canada, since 1837, and they have never house-branded anything but the very best.
There is a repair. 
When worn;  the right leg in the front has a very skillfully done, thumb-sized patch. 
It is semi-visible below my thumb, and to the right of the tan leaf in the last photo. 
It's a good photo, but the thumb sized patch is very hard to notice.
It's easiest to see if you stare at it.
5 refund after the purchase if anyone ever notices it when you are wearing it. ;-})D
I measured;
Armpit to pit is 22"" / 56cm. for a 44"" chest.
Shoulder seams are 18"" / 45,8cm. apart.
Sleeves from those seams are 25 1/2"" / 64,8cm. long.
Jacket length is 34"" / 86,6cm.
The pants are a 36"" / 91,6cm. in the waist.
Inseam is 29"" / 73,8cm., with 1 1/4"" / 3,3cm. hems for lengthening.
Front rise is 11"" / 28cm.
Rear rise is 18"" / 45,8cm.
Cuff width is 9 3/4"" / 24,8cm. wide.
The repair is difficult to notice so, if you would like additional pictures please ask.
That is a darn fly that landed on the pants, just at shutter time, yes.        ",59.00,4.8762,"Vintage item from the 1980s

4545,Beautiful Cream Crochet Reticule Reenacting Bag,"
            This is a lovely bag for a re-enactor. It would look great with any Civil War period dress or Victorian dress. This bag would be attached at the skirt waist by either pinning it or by attaching it through the ties of a waist sash.
It is a vintage handmade piece made using a sturdy cream cording. It is unlined. 
It is a really beautiful bag in very good condition. All of the cocoon tassels are in place and well attached.
The bag measures 61/2"" in length by 6"" wide. The top of the bag to the hem is 11""

5047,Roseville Pottery Juvenile Rolled Edge Plate ~ Chicks,"
            This Roseville Pottery Juvenile rolled edge plate is 8"" wide and is 1"" deep with a rolled edge.  The back is unmarked, This Juvenile Creamware line was originally introduced by Roseville Pottery around 1910.  It was produced for more than  20 years.  They are often unmarked but later examples from around 1924 are marked with the Rv stamp. 
There are 5 yellow chicks in the inner green circle.  The outer rim is orange and reads ""Baby's Plate"".  The age of the plate is shown in the condition, two small nicks in the rim, and a very thin 2"" crack that you can see by one of the chick's to the edge, but still remains a very sturdy plate. There is some light crazing.  I would guess that this plate may have been used by families for a few generations of children, not just displayed on a shelf!

There is an ON/OFF Lever at the back, and the wind up key is on the bottom.  It plays a lovely tune which is familiar to me, but I can't seem to grasp the name.  I will add it at a later date if I can come up with it.  It is in excellent condition with no chips, cracks or repairs.  Would make a lovely gift!

6001,Squeaky Dog Toy Assorted Chocolate and Vanilla Donuts,"
            Dogs love playing with our doughnuts...and best of all, these doughnut toys will bring a smile to your face as your dog chews, tosses and generally goofs around with a big doughnut in his mouth!
Each is about 5.5"" in diameter and about 1.5"" thick and both have a squeaker tucked inside. 
You will get one chocolate and one ""regular"" donut - and each will be decorated with ""frosting"" and drizzles or nibs or sprinkles. 
These toys are each handmade in small batches so your squeaky doughnuts may not be the exact ones in the photo, the placement of the decorations may be different since each is individually crafted.
This set is a random pair.  If you prefer to have a one of a kind custom donut sewn up for you, I can sew a set up for you to your specifications by purchasing my custom donut set:

6252,Non-Slip Dog Booties- Tootsie Toasters - Indoor / Outdoor dog boots / Senior dog booties,"
            These non-slip fleece dog boots come in sets of four. Custom made to fit your dog. PLEASE CONVO ME UPON ORDERING TO DISCUSS MEASUREMENTS. My goal is to make the best fitting boot for your pup. 
Light outdoor/Indoor boots have Tough-Tek non-slip, waterproof fabric on the bottom of the boot only. They make life easier for the senior dog who has trouble with hard, slippery floors and can be used outdoors as well. My senior dog only needed boots on her back feet so a set of four was perfect so I always had a clean pair for her to change into. 
The Extra-Tough Outdoor boots are for the more active dog or one who needs more protection from the elements. These can be used indoors as well. They have a lip of Tough-Tek non-slip, waterproof fabric over the toe as well as on the bottom of the boot. 
Prices are starting prices and may go up depending on the size of your dog's foot. 
Machine washable, air dry.
How to measure your dog's foot:
Materials needed: Pencil/pen, paper, ruler
Place your dog's foot on the paper. Using your pencil or pen, draw a line on both sides of the paw (make sure your pencil is straight up and down and not turned so that the writing is underneath the edge of the paw.) Draw another line at the edge of the longest nail on your dog's paw and at the heel where it touches the paper. Use your ruler to measure the distance between the two sides and between the nail and heel lines. These are the measurements I will need to make your custom boots. 
Your dog's safety and comfort are important to me. If the boots do not fit your dog when you receive them, send them back and I will make you a new set and ship them at no charge. Notify me within one week of receipt and I will start your new boots. They will ship as soon as I receive the original boots.        ",25.00,4.5556,"Handmade item

7069,Vintage Complete Sealing Wax Presentation Box Dennison's 1920's with Instructions,"
            Very old complete Dennison's sealing wax kit.  Does not include stamp.
Please see pics closely.  
Two of the little candles for heating the wax have been used and the bundle has melted slightly and become attached to the inside of the box.  
The box itself is in really great condition considering it's age of about 90 years.  There is some wear and upturning of the faux wood grain paper at the corners.  Still has the beautifully illustrated instructions on  the inside of the lid and cotton packing.
I have not spent any time trying to get the candles removed from the box.  It may be possible, but I would rather offer it as is than risk tearing the paper.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wngx8Yut9Dc
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carved candles are created according to the 16th century technology.
This candle is a stunning unique carved candle, which is a piece of art even when it is not burning. And when it is, it floods the room with soft and colorful light coming from its numerous curves.
The height of this small candle 4.7 inches (12 cm), weight about 0.9 pounds (400 grams). 
Your item is packed securely, so it will arrive quickly, and beautifully, just as you hoped:)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
Dear customer! It is very  important to me that when you buy my candles as a gift for yourself, your  friends or your  family that they are received in time and enjoyed. Please keep in mind the lead time for the delivery of the candles:
1) I promise to make and send you your candle in 1-3 working days.
2) - Delivery to the U.S. from Israel takes 2-2.5 weeks.
   - Delivery to Australia takes 2.5-3 weeks (sometimes 2 weeks, but I can not promise it)
   - Delivery to Europe takes 1-1.5 weeks.
Thank you for purchasing my candles!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating 
The root of the manufacturing technology of carved candles is in the 16th century, the elegant BAROQUE period. The preparation technique is quite complicated, as well as extremely fascinating. 
1. The first step is to dip the cast of hard paraffin into liquid colorful paraffin wax. It is necessary to monitor the temperature of the liquid paraffin wax during the dipping. In case the paraffin will not be hot enough, it will harden too fast and it will not be possible to carve it. 
2. The second step is the actual carving. This is the most creative and fascinating part of the candle preparation – the step of interpretation of the artist’s fantasy and imagination into the reality. For the purpose of carving special tools are used. The artist needs to decide upon the design in advance, in order for his motions to be quick and exact, since one has only a quarter an hour before the candle cools down and hardens. 
3. The third and the last step is to dip the carved candle into a special acrylic lacquer in order to create shine and to protect the prepared candle from the outer cold and hot damages, as well as from the dust accumulation.

Send me your razor and I will run it through a series of wetstones as follows: 1k, 3k Chosera, 8k Naniwa Snow White, then 12k Naniwa Super Stone and finishing on a Suehiro Gokumyo 20k. This has given me the best and consistent, smooth edges that I've experienced with straight razors. I can also finish on a Japanese natural wetstone or a Thuringian just let me know at checkout in the notes. 
Then the razor will be stropped on a Bison leather strop (I do not use compound) and shipped back to you 100% shave ready, Guaranteed! 
Please contact me first before buying this service as (unfortunately) many razors made in China, Pakistan, some ""customs"",  etc will not hold a serviceable edge at all.        ",18.00,4.9184,"Handmade item

9027,Organic Face Cream - Face Food with Beeswax - Natural Face Moisturizer - Natural Face Cream - Organic Face Moisturizer,"
            Face butter bliss. This facial nutrient is thick and rich. We've mixed a few of our favorite deeply moisturizing yet quickly absorbed facial oils and added a touch of beeswax to create a richly moisturizing facial balm.
This completely natural moisturizer is designed for all skin types. However, it is a thick and rich with a little bit going a long way. Use a thin layer of your Face Food in the mornings as an all-day moisturizer or apply liberally in the evenings as a leave-in mask.
This listing is for a 2oz or 4oz glass jar of our Face Food with Beeswax. Please make your selection from the drop down menu above.
This is our newer, organic beeswax version. This newer version is thicker and richer than the original Shea butter based vegan blend here: 
www.etsy.com/listing/231228064
Ingredients: organic jojoba oil, organic grape seed oil, organic sweet almond oil, organic beeswax, organic lavender essential oil, organic geranium essential oil, and vitamin E.
Check out our complete line-up of face care products here: 
www.etsy.com/shop/EmpireSquid?section_id=14737410
All of our lotions are rich and thick, with no evaporating alcohols or quickly dispersing waters. If you're new to our product line start with just a finger-full and rub that puppy in completely: a little bit goes a long way. If you find your skin asking for more after that, by all means dig in.
If you have any questions, concerns, or comments do not hesitate to contact us at any time. 
|| Scent Profile ||
Original: We keep this daily face moisturizer very lightly seasoned. The predominant scent will be a mild waft of lavender with light undertones of the slightly acerbic geranium essential oil. In its original form, this daily face treatment is designed to be as unassuming as possible, and thus you probably won't notice the scent at all a few minutes after application.
None: With no essential oils your Face Food will be very mildly scented with just a touch of earthiness from the natural oils and a hint of sweetness from the beeswax.
|| See what our amazing customers are saying about their Face Food ||
~~Used it last night and you could my skin sucking it in. Smells great too.~~
~~I really love this product so far. A little goes a long way, but it's possible to just grab a tiny bit and use it for day time use under your make up.~~
~~Love this stuff! I have really dry skin and this stuff has been a savior. It's too greasy to wear during the day, but I slather it on at night and it works great. The 2oz seemed a little small, but I have used the product every night for a month and I still have tons left. Definitely planning on buying more!~~
~~I start my day with this product! It is solid in the jar but spreads to a glossy oil that moisturizes and protects my skin. Perfect for sensitive skin and does not create breakouts.~~
~~Ultra moisturizing! Great herbal smell!~~
~~Love the beeswax moisturizer. I get very dry skin in cold Chicago winters. Using the beeswax has been the most moisturizing product compared to other face lotions & gels I've used in the past. A little goes a long way so it's worth the extra  considering you get more out of it than other moisturizers. Takes about 15-30 minutes for the moisturizer to soak in, so I'd suggest it as a night cream. Buy it & try it for yourself though :)~~
|| Ingredient Details ||
Jojoba oil, which is actually a liquid wax derived from jojoba seeds, is very similar to the oil (sebum) naturally produced by your skin and is therefore easily absorbed. It is an excellent moisturizer, and is also known to have both anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties making it an excellent choice for 'troubled' skin.
Sweet almond oil is rich in fatty acids and vitamin E. This skin softener helps your skin retain its natural moisture levels and may aid in the reduction of flaky, dry skin. Likely due to its vitamin E content, sweet almond oil is often regarded as useful for scar and stretch mark reduction.
Grape seed oil is high in beta-carotene and vitamins D, C, E, and rich in fatty acids. Extremely easily absorbed by the skin, grape seed oil works well for oily skin and helps to balance oily and dry patches on the face. The high linoleic acid content in grape seed oil helps to give it its anti-inflammatory, anti-allergen, acne reductive, and moisture retentive properties. Densely packed with antioxidants, grape seed oil has long been used for wrinkle reduction.
Beeswax is a powerful healing emollient known for it antibacterial and anti inflammatory properties. Rich in vitamin A, this protective wax helps seal moisture into the outer layers of skin while still allowing your dermis to breathe.  
Vitamin E has long been used for its healing and moisturizing properties, and has the added benefit of working as a natural preservative.
|| Beeswax or Shea? ||
For our newest line of facial butters, we've taken our extremely popular original Face Food 
www.etsy.com/listing/231228064
 pulled out the Shea and inserted some naturally processed beeswax instead. 
We've done this for a couple of reasons. First of all, we love the healing, moisturizing, and protective properties of beeswax, and second, Shea can be a pain to work with. While Shea butter has some great skin-loving properties itself, this butter tends to melt easily and turn gritty randomly. Since we refuse to use any unnatural stabilizers or emulsifiers, there's really nothing we can do to assure that our Shea based butters will remain rich and creamy and not turn gritty; this is not a problem with our beeswax based butters.
Despite its flaws, our original Face Food is still very popular so we've decided not to faze it out, but we feel this newest iteration of our beloved first creation may be the perfect, completely natural and effortlessly simple facial butter. 
|| Shelf Life ||
Since there is absolutely nothing artificial and no preservatives except for the natural preserving properties of vitamin E, please keep in mind that this lotion will not keep forever. While the oils and butters in this lotion are known to be quite stable, we still recommend you use your lotion within eight months, perhaps longer if you keep it in the fridge (keep in mind it will get fairly firm if kept in such a cold environment). Your lotion should be kept out of direct sunlight.
This lotion may liquefy in hot (over 84 F) environments. Liquefaction will in no way harm your lotion, and simply tossing it in the fridge overnight will bring it back to its intended texture. Please keep in mind that shipping to or through hot climates, particularly in the summer months, may result in a liquefied lotion.        ",18.00,4.9624,"Handmade item

            Our fidget toys are perfect to help maintain focus and concentration on tasks while allowing your hands to play with a noiseless gadget.
Each of our spinners is tested by hand to ensure that each spinner is working perfectly before it is shipped to you! When you order from us you will receive a very high quality product every time.
Measuring 7cm across (just under 3 inches), these toys easily fit in your hand, purse or pocket so you can comfortably take them with you for use anywhere at any time.
The center bearing is 20mm, and produces long spin times (up to 3 minutes under good conditions), and can easily be upgraded anywhere bearings are sold to get extremely long spin times.
New bearings require time to break in before reaching maximum spin times, however this process is quick and all that is required is that you use the spinner as normal and watch your times improve.
Tri-Spinners make a great gift item, and come with caps to place over the center bearing should you choose to use them.

9542,Niffler stuffed animal Express order,"
            Need it within a week? No problem! this is the same exact item as the other listing but express! 
Why the extra cost? A Niffler takes about 10-12 hours to make just one, and I usually make the the nifflers in batches of 5 per week. In addition you get to skip a 3-4 week wait! When ordering this option, not only is your Niffler finished within a couple of days, it comes with 2 day shipping.   
INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS*** Unfortunately for international customers we can only guarantee it will be finished within a couple days. we cannot guarantee it will arrive to you within that week.
 
The number of these slots depend on how many extra I think I can handle

9927,Vintage Rotary Phone with Long Cord - Great Condition,"
            Very nice vintage phone in great condition. I have full reason to believe it works as I retrieved this item from an estate sale and it was still hardwired in the wall. The bottom of the phone has a few stickers on it from when AT&T serviced over its long life. The styling and the black dial lead me to believe that this phone is from either the 50's or 60's. As you'll see in the last photo the end of the cord is raw and can either be adapted to plug into a modern phone jack or it can be hardwired right into your wall. Measures 9"" x 5"" x 5"".
If you have any questions about this used/vintage item, please contact me before you purchase as their are no refunds/returns/exchanges based on their used appearance. Additional photographs are available by request prior to purchase.
I will ship this item USPS Priority Mail and it includes free tracking and insurance. Group shipping is also available for multiple items purchased from my store in the same check-out transaction!

10050,Buffalo Bone Dice (Viking/Medieval Rolling Bones),"
            These hand crafted bone dice are period accurate for many different centuries.
Historically, this style of dice have been found in archaeological expeditions exploring Egypt, Roman Settlements, Viking Settlements, Civil War, and in the Early American Colonies.  Bone dice are a timeless artifact spanning many times and cultures.
Ideal for betting, reenactments, and curiosity pieces. Each dice is hand carved and polished from authentic Buffalo Bone. No two dice are the same, as the natural bone grain and thickness determine the final appearance. Our crafters also offer a tea-stained version for a more antiqued look.
You can expect the following from your dice:
Around 1/2 an inch square
Made from real buffalo bone
Natural or Tea Stain Finish
Hinged Acrylic Display Case
Shipped in a padded mailer to protect the product.
Yours Truly,
Erick

12233,Personalized Groomsmen tie clip set crafted from a Whiskey Barrel,"
            For the Jack Daniel's® lover, this tie bar is crafted from a White Oak stave from a Jack Daniel's® whiskey barrel. The natural texture comes from the inside of the barrel, with the hand-charred barrel interior on prominent display. The barrel craftsmen carefully toast and char the inside of the barrel to caramalize the wood's natural sugars. It's from the toasted oak that the whiskey draws its rich amber color, distinctive flator, and finish. It measures roughly 1.6"" long by 0.35"" wide and is buffed with a wax and shellac blend.
Engraving of your groomsmen's initials is included in the price! Please leave instructions and the engraving details in the notes to seller box at checkout, and please also put in your wedding date so I can make sure you receive them in time.
Quercus alba, the white oak, is one of the pre-eminent hardwoods of eastern North America. It is a long-lived oak of the family Fagaceae, native to eastern North America and found from southern Quebec west to eastern Minnesota and south to northern Florida and eastern Texas. Specimens have been documented to be over 450 years old.

12481,NATURAL Alexandrite Ring in 14K Yellow Gold with Certificate!!!  Free Shipping in The USA,"
            Natural Alexandrite Ring in 14K Yellow Gold with Certificate!!!
4* 5x2.5mm marquise alexandrite
0.67 CT alexandrite 
This beautiful greenish blue stone is called Alexandrite and is known to change its color to purple . Our beautiful stone is placed into a gorgeous 14 K yellow gold ring . It is a very fine quality,natural stone . If the ring needs to be re-sized please contact us before purchasing.
ALEXANDRITE
 
Alexandrite is one of the jewels that can be used as a birthstone for June, the others being pearl and moonstone. Alexandrite is a form of chrysoberyl, which forms in the earth’s crust due to the action of magma. It’s unique in that, unlike other chrysoberyls, Alexandrite contains not only impurities of iron and titanium, but chromium, which is crucial to its value. Pure chrysoberyl is clear and colorless or very pale yellow.
Alexandrite has a hardness on the Mohs scale of 8.5, which means it’s the hardest gemstone behind diamond and corundums like ruby and sapphire.
Alexandrite, besides having a recent history  is also quite rare. Its two components, beryllium and chromium, don’t usually occur together in nature.
One amazing thing about Alexandrite is that it changes color. The gem is green or green blue in natural daylight and then turns a dazzling red-violet or purplish red when placed under artificial light. It can do this because of chromium. Chromium absorbs yellow light with great efficiency. Only chrysoberyls that can change their color this way can be called Alexandrite. Unlike some other gems that seem to change color, the change in Alexandrite’s color isn’t dependent on the angle at which the stone is viewed.
June birthstone — Alexandrite is considered by astrologers to be a stone of good luck and is supposed to sharpen the intuition and creativity of its wearer

Soft cotton and lovely embroidered mesh lace are trimmed with soft beige elastics and accented with little blue hand-tied bows.

THE BRA
Classic soft bra with no under-wires, made of pink cotton and beautiful embroidered mesh lace in ecru colour. Straps are adjustable and the sheer back is closed with classic hook and eye closure.  
Soft bras are proved to be a comfortable and beautiful option that is soft and beneficial to breast tissue, allowing the normal circulation in this tender tissues and enchanting breast self support. On the opposite, under-wired bras are considered damaging breast self support over the long run.

As this delicate pale blue and soft cream combination is very hard to capture on a picture, please see details on the melon and cream bra. Blue one is made exactly the same way. 
THE PANTIES
Pink cotton front and ecru lace back and sides embrace the hips with no side seam - the lace on the back continues on the front of the panties. These knickers feature Brazilian cut which is the name of the sexy back look that leaves the bottom part of the cheeks uncovered. The little lining is organic cotton.

Each skinny tie clip measures approximately 1/4"" x 1 3/4"" (give or take due to it being hand shaped)
Each is 100% handmade from start to finish in our small home shop.  Purchase this custom gift with confidence in knowing that it is not mass produced or available anywhere else. We use only high quality metals, not store bought blanks, and cut the shapes ourselves. They are all made by hand cutting the metal into the shape shown. Each is then further shaped and fine tuned to eliminate rough edges.  They are personalized with hand stamping. Each letter is carefully hammered into the metal - one by one. The spacing and depth of the letters can vary - since this is not done by a machine. These differences make every item completely one of a kind. It should be noted that they can only be hand stamped on one side, not both.  We are proud to offer a handcrafted item for your special occasion that was made in the USA    
Please contact me regarding bulk orders for weddings and favors as we may be able to offer a price break depending on the quantity purchased.

12891,Vintage Frank Usher Occasion wear or Mother of the Bride Outfit this is very wearable for any Occasion with a beautifully fitting dress,"
            A really lovely dress and jacket by Frank Usher, the fabric is glazed cotton but is very soft, size 10. The dress has a discreet zip right down the back (see picture 3) This outfit could be worn for any occasion it is just so wearable, yet it has hardly been worn. The dress is made to flatter, with the bodice fitted to the waist and flat pleats at the front if the skirt (see picture 5) The dress has a 27"" waist and waist to hem is 26"" bust 34"". The jacket is cut in a blouson style with three quarter sleeves, a very nicely shaped collar going into an open front down to band around the waist which is shaped from the waist onto the hips. This outfit is so different from later Frank Usher designs, it is not at all dated and it is unlikely someone else would turn up at an event in the same outfit. It will make a very smart summer dress or could be dressed up for any occasion.        ",99.50,4.6,"Vintage item from the 1960s

13158,thug wife mug / engagement mug / wedding gift / unique gift / bridal shower gift / engagement gift / personalized mug.,"
            yous a thug and you know it!! flaunt your shit because you're awesome, or help a newly-married caffeine-lover friend show off the bling with a snarky new mug! this 14 oz. latte style mug shows everyone how badass you are!
*** NOTE: the design is centered slightly closer to the handle than other mugs for optimum engagement ring picture-taking!!! this mug is the perfect accessory to showing off that bling!!!! ***
*** EACH MUG is 100% handwritten by me with an oil-based paint, then air cured for at least 24 hours and heat set. 
this is why customized orders tend to take a little longer (and also why you’ll see each one has unique details and slight differences)! your mug is totally one-of-a-kind!
every mug comes with a care instruction card. mugs should be GENTLY hand washed in cool water to preserve the design (please do not use any sponges or scrubbers, and definitely NO dishwashers!). since this is a handmade piece, please expect normal wear and tear as you use it - but the better you take care of it, the longer it will last!
please wash with love and care and it’ll love you back. <3  
as per my shop policies, i am not responsible for artwork washing off with improper care.
BE SURE TO SELECT THE NUMBER OF MUGS YOU'D LIKE UNDER THE ""QUANTITY"" DROPDOWN BOX! 
IF YOU NEED YOUR MUG BY A SPECIFIC DATE 1.5 WEEKS OR SOONER FROM THE ORDER DATE, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PURCHASING A RUSH SHIPPING FEE! it's only 10 more and will put your mug at the front of my mug line! here's the link for anyone that's interested:

     in the 'note to seller' section of your order, be sure to let me know any important names, monograms, or dates if you selected one of those personalization options!  
if you are getting customization added, please also let me know what font you'd prefer for your date, name, or monogram by selecting from the font options pictured above! if no font is specified, the VINTAGE SCRIPT font will be the default font. <3

13655,Textured Blush Pink Silk Linen Neck Tie,"
            Details:
Each necktie is handmade with the idea of artfulness and tailoring in mind.
This particular neck tie was hand stitched from a sought-after blush pink silk linen which is a breathable, high quality and highly textured linen silk without being too bulky. The lining is a blush polka dot silk to finish off the pieces perfectly.
Add the Matching pocket square for only 17 more when purchasing this tie (Separately is 25)
Handsome&Lace isn't an assembly line production company, nor do I scrimp on adding small details when I can. I truly love what I do and make sure each and every layer and stitch is a representation of my integrity for uniqueness and ambition to be well tailored. For real. 
From personally sourcing fabrics to hand cutting from handmade patterns, to ironing right here in studio playing the best music, and hand stitching over 450 tight invisible per tie! That's about 8 stitches an inch unlike most necktie companies. Each detail is well thought out in hopes that this tie will be your favourite tie!
***If you want something a little different, then I do custom, multiples or tailored orders too such as longer lengths, monogramming, fabric sourcing etc. Pretty much anything you can dream up, I can do!

 The truth is that nobody really NEEDS a fancy, ivory leather wedding bag, but let's face it- it's just SO CUTE! This is a leather bridal bag that can also be used as a tote bag organizer, as a home makeup organizer, or as a stand alone make up bag that you can carry around with you. It can also be combined with matching makeup bags of different sizes to make the perfect bridesmaid gift.
   When it's unfolded the bridesmaid clutch measures app 10"" x 10"" (25 cm x 25 cm) It is designed to be small enough to carry it around and still big enough to fit your essentials- phone, wallet, keys, a small notebook and some cosmetics. The outside layer of the leather wedding purse is made of high quality soft vegan leather which makes it waterproof. The inside layer is made of up-cycled fabric since we all care about the environment. It has a handmade tassel attached to it's zipper, to make it easier to open and close.

            A note about color and turquoise: turquoise varies widely from greenish blue to teal to very bright blue. I crush 100% natural turquoise, but different mines have different colorations. I don't add any artificial stabilizers or dyes to my products.  In order to provide a more consistent color, this material is a blend of turquoise and chrysocolla. I have 100% turquoise available as well in another listing.
We offer our crushed turquoise blend in four different grinds (or textures). 
Extra Coarse- The consistency of very fine gravel.
Coarse- The consistency of rough sand. Large grains.
Medium- The consistency of fine sand. Small grains.
Fine- The consistency of powder. May have very fine grains.
Our crushed turquoise blend is excellent for use in woodworking inlays. Fill the cracks with the crushed turquoise then apply a thin CA glue. Allow glue to dry then sand and finish the wood as normal.
This is 100% pure turquoise and chrysocolla! 
You will receive 1 oz. of crushed turquoise blend.
I will ship your entire order for 3, regardless of how many items.        ",12.00,4.8333,"Handmade Supply

❤ ❤THANK YOU for making the FABRIC SHOPPE a FAVORITE!!❤ ❤
Thank so much for visiting the Fabric Shoppe. We are humbled and grateful to be one of the TOP fabric sellers on Etsy. We have been selling quality fabrics in bundles since 2008! We are so HONORED to be known for our handpicked bundles and quick shipping. We know that not everyone has the budget to buy an entire line of fabric or has time to pick fabrics one by one from a sea of options. So we pick and choose fabrics that coordinate nicely and bundle them for you to make your fabric shopping easy and enjoyable and hopefully inspiring.
There are no words to express how grateful I am to have a small business that provides for our family and the families of our employees. When you purchase from small business you really are making a difference in a family and a community. Your purchase doesn't go to a gigantic company's bottom line but to a little girls dance lessons or a unforeseen medical bill or a little more room in the grocery budget. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

14928,Lace bobbin with decorative thread wrapping,"
            This midlands style bobbin will look great on your lacing pillow. I have made this bobbin on my lathe from American Black Cherry for durability and good looks.  I have decorated it with thread wrappings to enhance the appearance.  Each thread is applied individually to create the pattern, then a color protector is applied to protect the threads from being discolored by the other finishes.  A coat of epoxy is then applied over the threads to protect them from wear and dirt.  The rest of the bobbin is protected with a clear, durable finish.  As far as I know, no one else decorates their bobbins using this method.
  
The bobbin is about 4 1/2“ (120 mm) long and is approximately 1/4“ (6 mm) in maximum diameter.  The spangles are made with glass beads, and are color coordinated with the threads in the decoration.  The bobbin you see is the one you will get.
If you have a color combination you would like, please contact me to arrange custom colors for you.  I can be contacted by messaging me through Etsy.        ",20.00,4.75,"Handmade item

14953,Handmade exotic African wood tatting shuttle,"
            It is 100% handcrafted by me.
The shuttle was made from African wood.
After I hand polished put one layer water-based lacquer coat which contains only water dissolvent (advised for baby wooden toys). This improved the usability of the shuttle – made it quicker - and it got a warm polish.
This pretty shuttle measures approx. 2 3/4"" long by 1"" wide.
It comes from a smoke and pet free house.

We know that not everyone has the budget to buy an entire line of fabric or has time to pick fabrics one by one from a sea of options. So we pick and choose fabrics that coordinate nicely and bundle them for you to make your fabric shopping easy and enjoyable and hopefully inspiring.
There are no words to express how grateful I am to have a small business that provides for our family and the families of our employees. When you purchase from small business you really are making a difference in a family and a community. Your purchase doesn't go to a gigantic company's bottom line but to a little girls dance lessons or a unforeseen medical bill or a little more room in the grocery budget. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

HELIUM INSTRUCTIONS:
If filling with helium, we recommend carefully filling balloons with helium as close to the event as possible for best results. Do not over-inflate, these balloons may pop. High altitude can affect the balloon's ability to float. Foil balloons are sensitive to extreme temperature changes. In cold air, they may appear deflated; warm air should expand them again. Extreme heat can cause the helium to expand and burst the balloon.

            This is a 16oz hammer that is engraved with your own custom phrase. The hammer is standard size, and good for normal use, or for display.
These hammers are laser engraved. They are not vinyl decals or stickers, so the engraving is permanent.
I do my own engraving, so any message can be put on them, making them perfect for ANY occasion. If you are unsure of how many lines your custom text will need, please feel free to send me a message before ordering. If you do not like the fonts shown, I can use pretty much any font found on your computer. If you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact me.
The fonts are labeled as ""Font 1-3"" in the last 3 pictures. If you're unsure which to choose, Font 1 (main picture) is the most popular choice.
Pricing: 
1 line of text: 18
1 line of text with name on back: 24
2 lines of text: 24
2 lines of text plus name on back: 30
Discounts are available on orders of 5 or more. Please message me for more information.
Please be sure to leave your custom text in the ""Notes to Seller"", and also if you would like the name on the front or back of the hammer. (Front would be facing the person using the hammer if they are right handed, back would be facing away)
Due to variations in wood grain, your hammer may look slightly different than the images shown above. I also take great care to ensure that the size of the font is adjusted appropriately based on the text you want engraved. Your single-line text will not typically be as large as the Font 2 image, unless specifically requested.
Shipping costs are automatically calculated based on the actual shipping cost to your address. These typically ship in 3 days or less, but may take up to 2 weeks as we get close to holidays like Fathers Day, Christmas, and Graduations.

            Nails are ready for shipping in 3-5 Business days. I ship them in a decorative paper box with tissue paper so it's ready to give as a gift or to keep for yourself : ) More fake nails sets created by me can be found at: 
Nailsbysammi.Etsy.com
This listing is for one set of 18 nails. There are 9 different sizes which are designed to fit most average natural nails, but they can be gently filed to help give a more comfortable fit. All of the nails in the set are duplicates of a size, to aid in proper fitting. 
This nail set includes sizes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, & 9.
Nails last for up to 7 days with nail glue if they are taken care of, and are reusable when attached using double sided nail stickers.
TIPS FOR APPLICATION
-Do NOT use a base coat - simply buff the nail before application
-Use nail glue instead of stickers for longer-lasting nails
-Press the artificial nail firmly onto the natural nail and hold for a few seconds until secure

A recipe set in retro style with unique design patterns and clip art elements, adding flair to your family recipes!  
Creating a custom recipe binder has never been easier!  
::::::::::::::: PRINTABLES :::::::::::::::
In this set you'll receive 49 printable templates:
1 Editable Cover Page for your recipe binder.
8 Editable Recipe Pages, each page comes in a different design. You can type in your recipe directly in the PDF and print a new recipe page anytime you need.
NEW: 8 Editable Recipe Pages with an area to place an image to illustrate your recipes. Just open the PDF, type your recipe information, click on the image placeholder and insert any image. 
8 Editable Recipe Pages with two recipes per page, for shorter recipes. 
8 Printable Recipe Pages. Similar to the editable recipe cards but these pages have lines so you can write your recipes by hand.
8 Editable Dividers. Each divider has a different color. You can type in any recipe category directly in the PDF, print the divider out and add to your binder.
8 Editable Table of Content Pages. Each of these has a different design matching a recipe page. You can use them to list all your recipes within a category, making menu planning very easy.

Tabs to match with the divider pages. Type your category, trim and attach the tabs easily on your dividers. 
All documents are PDFs, optimized for printing on white letter size 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper.  You can open the editable templates in Adobe Reader, type your own text, save it and print it as many times as you need on your color printer. The PDFs are in high quality 300dpi resolution for perfect sharp printing results at home or at a professional printing service.
::::::::::::::: IMPORTANT :::::::::::::::
Please note this is a digital product and NO physical product will be sent. The files will be available for download on your Etsy purchases page right after your payment clears. 
Note: If your printer does NOT have the option for borderless printing, you may have a hard time getting your pages to align properly.Please, be sure your printer supports borderless printing before proceeding with your order.
::::::::::::::: FAQ :::::::::::::::
WHAT ARE EDITABLE PDFS?
They are forms in which you can type in your own text wherever you see the light blue background. When printed, the light blue will not remain. After you add your text, you can save it as a new document so you always have a blank document to start with. You can also print the blank forms without typing into them and later fill them in by hand.
HOW DO I PRINT THIS SET?
The files are intended for printing on 8.5"" x 11"" white letter size paper. For best results when printing from Adobe Reader, your printer should be set at 100% page sizing (NO scaling) and print without margins. Please note that laser printers usually print a bit darker and more saturated than inkjet printers. You might need to run some test and adjust your settings before you get optimal results.
CAN I CHANGE THE FONT?
Yes, if you open the file in Adobe Reader first click on an editable area where you want to type (this is important, don't skip this step!). After, you can press CTRLE (or CMDE on a Mac) to show a rich text formatting bar named ""properties bar"". In the properties bar, you can choose the font size, font style and font color of your choice.
CAN I SAVE THE PDFs?
Yes, you can fill in your own text and save the document when you are done, e.g. to bring your recipe pages to a printing service.
WHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY ORDER?
As soon as your payment clears, you'll receive a an automatic email notification letting you know where you can download your files.

16569,ＫＩＤＡ ⋯  Atlantis Cosplay Necklace Opalite Iridescent Crystal Point Pendant Gold Brown Faux Suede Cord,"
            ✧ ⋯ ＤＥＳＣＲＩＰＴＩＯＮ ⋯ ✧
Opalite is one of my all time favorites, and I just couldn't resist making this necklace. This necklace was inspired by Princess Kida's crystal necklace from ""Atlantis"" and is nearly a perfect replica in terms of length, color, and material. The stone is beautiful and iridescent, appearing blue or white depending on the lighting. Its natural glow automatically resembles Kida's glowing necklace. 
The length of the faux suede is around 18 inches long and closes with a clasp. The length of the pendant itself is about 2"".
*If you would like a different length, just message me.
While this necklace would be perfect for cosplay, its simplicity makes it also perfect for everyday wear. A two-in-one if you ask me! The necklace does not glow in the dark, but is very reflective of light even in dim settings.
✧ ⋯ ＯＰＡＬＩＴＥ ⋯ ✧
Opalite is a subtle yet highly energetic stone. It speaks to the third eye chakra. It is the ideal stone for meditation. Opalite improves communication on all levels, especially the spiritual. It removes energy blockages of the chakras and meridians. Emotionally, Opalite helps by assisting during transitions of all kinds. It engenders persistence and gives us strength in verbalising our hidden feelings. It can also help us to be successful in business.
Opalite is an all-round healing stone. It aids sexual prowess, enhancing sexual experience. Opalite stabilises mood swings and helps in overcoming fatigue. It purifies the blood and kidneys.
Opalite strongly attracts light beings, it a stone to use in communication’s to the Angelic kind and to attract positive light energies to any being or any area. A very beneficial stone in helping one to have raised hope and strength, good for lessoning anxiety and soothing frayed nerves

17035,Mother's day gift for teacher Unique vintage Abalone ring Womans signet ring abalone paua shell jewelry peacock rings silver filigree rings,"
            Mother's day gift -  for teacher - Unique vintage Abalone ring - Womans signet ring in large size, unique piece of abalone paua shell jewelry, peacock abalone rings in silver filigree.
Size: 9 3/4 ( US and Canada ), T 1/4 ( UK and Australia ), 19 3/4 ( European ). Only this size available.
This is a large woman's signet ring, not resizeable.
This big round signet ring for woman features a piece of gorgeous rainbow abalone, round shape, measuring 16 mm in diameter. This stone is set in a filigree dark silver plated ring of typical Russian classic style.
Metal - jewelry making alloy ""melchior"" and halvanic ( electric ) silver plate. This ring is plated with dark oxydized silver for more ""antique"" look.
The ring is made by famous Russian jewelry manufacturer ""Krasnaya Presnya"". This factory has been in business for over 75 years. They used to make gold plated and silver plated jewelry with natural gemstones, art glass and enamel. Their style is recognizeable: beautiful shapes and high quality metalwork in filigree techniqie with granulation.
WHAT IS FILIGREE?
These hand crafted vintage earrings represent Russian filigree jewelry making technique.
The word FILIGREE means - ""threads and grains"". Filigree refers to jewelry that incorporates into its design handcrafted twisted threads ( wires ) of gold, silver or other metals. The metal is soldered onto the frame or silhouette part and is arranged in delicate designs of various patterns. This fine metalwork appearance is reminiscent of lace. Filigree can sometimes be used as a term to describe any type of pattern in jewelry that looks delicate, intricate and sophisticated.
A few words about the granulated work - it means metal grains, globules, balls or beads, soldered to the metal surface to form fancy patterns.
Filigree jewelrywith natural gemstones, made in Russia or USSR, is a great idea for collectioning. This piece of jewelry carries the spirit of Russian retro fashion and will look good with classic elegant woman's attire or vintage outfits.
All my items are gift wrapped and ready to ship, with a tracking number provided.

17444,Sacred grapes cluster grapes earrings in tagua pearls by Allie/purple/cabernet/multicolor/green,"
            This design is part of my last released collection ""Sacred grapes"" ispired in Southern California and Central California Wine County. It was designed and conceived this winter  when I visited Solvang and Santa Inez Valley and discovered the beautiful CA wine county around the CA country side roads. The views were spectacular, I felt like a protagonist of the movie ""Sideways"" or ""Entre copas"" and wanted to create something to tribute the CA vineyards and wine growers. 
Now, I just moved to Temecula Valley with 50 wineries close to my  home in Chardonnay Hills, the designing of this new line is  just part of my evolution and new  phase as jewelry designer.
It is made of Tagua tiny pearls arranged in a  grape cluster with silver charms, the leaves are delicately handcarved from tagua nuts. The post are fisherman hook style hypoallergenic.
Sacred grapes line is currentlty selling at Orfila Winery, Escondido, CA , Oriana Winery and The Presidio at Santa Barbara, CA and Thornton Winery, Hart Winery. Falkner. Oak Mountain Winery and Churon Winery in Temecula Valley, CA. Also at San Gabriel Arcangel Mission close to LA.  The name sacred grapes is because the first vineyards and making of the wine in CA started in the CA Catholic Missions with the missionaries when  Fray Junipero Serra started the Hispanic Missions .

            Small Sterling Silver Open Hoop Earrings
I made a pair of these tiny open hoops as a custom order, and then liked them so much I decided to add them to my listings. They are super cute!  These handmade earrings are crafted from 20 gauge sterling silver wire. The simple clean design is both classic and modern, and has a very minimalist look.  The front of the earring has a flat, smooth surface, hammered to about 1.5mm wide.  The earrings are approximately 13mm long (just about 1/2"").  Handmade in Maine!
The details:
♦ This listing is for one pair of earrings
♦ Crafted from 20 gauge wire (a standard earwire size in the U.S.)
♦ The front side of the open hoop is hammered flat with a smooth finish
♦ The total length is approximately ½” long (13mm)
♦ Soft earring backs are included. Because of the small size of these earrings, I would recommend using backs.
These also come in gold:

And rose gold:

Care:
♦ As with any jewelry, I recommend removing your earrings before sleeping, bathing or swimming
♦ Clean with a soft polishing cloth
Packaging:
♦ Earrings come carefully packaged in a classic white cotton-filled box with a colorful ribbon tied around it, ready to gift – or keep for yourself!

- For light cleaning, gently polish with a soft, lint-free cloth to avoid scratching. 
- Store your beloved jewelry in a cool dry place.

This eyewear sleeve is vegan friendly, made from durable, high quality man made leather.  It has two little birds appliqued on the front.

20754,Merde Il Pleut Umbrellas,"
            Doesn't everyone need an opinionated umbrella? These charming, long-handled umbrellas let everyone know what you're thinking (which is, of course, ""Shit it's raining"" en anglais), brightening your day even when it's gray.
These are non-collapsible, full-length umbrellas with a sleek curved handle. Red, Yellow, Lime Green, Purple, Orange, Cobalt Blue, and Hot Pink styles have Silver fiberglass handles (seen in the main photo) and the Forest Green, and Black styles have wooden handles. All have the same block print followed by a very small ""TM"" mark. These charming, lightweight umbrellas are great for brightening rainy days and offering protection from the rain but are not rated for high winds.  
     We are happy to ship our beautiful umbrellas to almost anywhere.  We ship via UPS Ground for continental shipments, though additional shipping charges may apply for Alaska, Hawaii, and P.O. Boxes (convo us for the best quotes and time estimates!). Shipping costs reflect extra charges for ""oversize packages"" due to length of umbrellas.
Approximate dimensions for umbrellas are 34.5""- 35.5"" in length & 2"" diameter closed, or 40.5"" diameter opened.
     For international orders, including Canada and Mexico, we ship via US Postal Service Priority Mail. Please contact us directly BEFORE BUYING for shipping times and costs if you'd like an umbrella shipped to you internationally!        ",27.00,4.8333,"Handmade item
