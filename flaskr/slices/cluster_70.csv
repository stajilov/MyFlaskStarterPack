2802,"Vintage Chinese protection pendant with yin yang, bagua and ancient Chinese script - ONE pendant, brass vintage style Chinese pendant, 1 pc.","
            Vintage Chinese brass pendant for jewelry designs, bag charms or decorations. 
The pendant is believed to protect the wearer with its ancient Chinese characters that entreat bad spirits to stay away!  The other side of the pendant features a traditional yin yang symbol surrounded by the bagua (eight trigrams) used in Taoism.  
For a full explanation of the Bagua, this Wiki link provides more information:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua
The pendant can be strung on fabric, leather or cord. It is believed that by incorporating the colour red you will energize the properties of the pendant.
The pendant measures 32mm (1 1/4"") in length and 27mm (1 1/16"") across. There is a 2.5-3mm hole for stringing.
This listing is for ONE pendant.

So here is a Smokey the Bear patch for others to enjoy.
It measures 2.5 inches high, iron on backing and Excellent detail to the design. I originally incorrectly identified them as 3 inches high. They are still as vibrant and awesome in their outdoorsiness!

Size: Small.
 
This will fit (most but not all) Miniature Poodles, Shih Tzu, Italian Greyhound and other similar breeds. 
Measure your dog all the way around, right behind their ears to be sure this is the size needed since dogs of the same breed can vary a lot in size. 
Example: If your dog measures more than 13"", the medium would be a better fit. 
A customer sent me this picture of her puppy (not sure what breed) wearing a small snood and another customer sent me a picture of her Chinese Crested powder puff wearing a Xsmall. 
This is NOT a color choice to pick from. Item you are buying is the one pictured and as described in title and description.
Since these are made to order picture may not represent size offered.
♦♦ FEATURES ♦♦
1. The snood measures approx. 8"" in length and the ends will stretch comfortably from 10""-13"".
2. It will keep your dogs ears out of their food bowl and keeps them clean for the shows.
3. The snood is constructed out of a 100% polyester microsuede type fabric, It's slick on the inside and slightly napped on the outside.
4. Elastic on both ends, all edges overlocked before sewing together to prevent fraying when washed.

7435,POKEBOMS - Bath bombs with Pokemon figure inside,"
            This listing is for 1 red, white and black bath bomb scented to smell like marshmallow - with scents of whipped vanilla, raw sugar cane and heavy cream! All of Berwyn Betty's bath bombs are colored with food grade colorant and will not stain tubs, towels or skin.  This is a 3"" bath bomb - about the size of a standard baseball.  
As with all Berwyn Betty bath bombs, there is a surprise inside. This bomb contains a Pokemon figurine! The characters are all authentic and from the popular series.  The characters are random and specific characters can not be requested - sorry!
Your little sport will love the fizz and bubbles that go on for about 5 minutes,when one of these is lobbed into the tub.  It's like a very cool chemistry experiment.  As these ""fireworks"" occur, color, scent and moisturizing oils are released into the tub. After all of the fizzle and fireworks of submerging one of these bad boys into a tubful of water is over, your little guy is left to find the surprise capsule in the tub!
 Berwyn Betty bath bombs are made by me, by hand in small batches.  I pride myself in making quality products.  Whenever possible, I use certified, natural pure essence oils.  If a scent cannot be found in nature, I use quality fragrance oils that retain their scent.  Not the cheapest, but definitely the best.  I will not sell a product that I would not personally buy.  I will not use a scent that I don't like.  I am always seeking out molds and surprises to appeal to all kinds of kids - especially boys.
  
Boys love bath bombs just as much as girls -- just not pink and sparkly and princess-y.  I am passionate about soap making, and I strive to deliver a product that appeals to kids that are also passionate about something- whether it be blocks, action figures, cars or outer space.
This bomb weighs approximately 6 oz. The bomb is shrink wrapped with ingredient sticker.

7833,the beekeeper's quilt KNITTING PATTERN,"
            hi ♥ before you get too excited, this is a knitting pattern k?
After your purchase, the download links will be available immediately through etsy!  ♥

Wheee! The beekeeper’s quilt! ♥
Made of little stuffed honeycomb shaped puffy pockets called ""hexipuffs""♥  
Use leftover scrap sock wool & it doesn’t have to be lined because it’s puffy & double sided!
The hexipuffs are fun to make because they’re smushy, cute & feel like a little finished project all by themselves. wheeee I love tossing them in the basket!
Oh yes, and they are knitted in the round ♥
I made a video blog with more info about them here: http://vimeo.com/26832987
This project is most rewarding if you knit it “on the go.” It’s so portable! 
I had a little bag with me in my purse at all times. (and in the car too!)
All of my honeycombs were made during “in-between” times over the span of one year. 
It’s really fun to add your new little hexipuff to the hexipuff basket.
Knit them while you are waiting in lines, waiting for dinner, talking to friends, in the car etc. and see how many you end up with. :)
Pattern includes:  lots of photos, photo tutorial on the quick, easy way to join the hexipuffs, full color charts for duplicate stitch flowers.  (poppies ~shown~ & violets)
ps. joining them is QUICK & EASY! i joined my whole quilt together in 2 days. :) 
(full photo tutorial in the pattern) ♥ 
 They are joined at the corners with simple quilt-ties for better “flop-a-bility”
(Also: Because of the way they are connected, if one gets damaged or stained, they can be lifted out easily 1 at a time to be replaced :)
♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ 
all materials, needle sizes, measurements, notions,  
and wool choice/colors are listed in the pattern. :)

7876,"Piñon Resin, Wildcrafted Resin Incense, Trementina Resin,Pine Resin, Pine Pitch Incense, Space Clearing, Balancing Ritual,","
            Piñon Resin, Trementina Resin wildcrafted from my home in New Mexico is a sacred resin commonly used by Native Americans. It has been used to heal, to balance and clear energies, and for fertility, compassion and mental strength. Burn by itself, or combine with other incense resins. It has a uniquely Southwestern aroma other pine resins don't even come close.
Smudging has been a ritual and ceremonial practice used by cultures around the world since humans have existed. The Native Americans have used the earths’ plants, both fresh and dry, for healing. Plants are known to carry their own energy, just as our bodies and surroundings do. The art of smudging, with burning sage, woods, herbs or resins and focusing on our own ritual and prayers, helps to clear negative unwanted energy. Smudging cleanses, rebalances and opens fresh energy so our life and chakra energy continues to flow much like an open river so we can move forward. Stagnant old energy holds us back from living an energetic authentic life!
You may choose to use a fireproof bowl, plate, ceramic pot, small baking dish, censer, brazier, or other vessel in which to burn your resin or loose/crushed herbs. Burn on charcoal or on mica. I prefer resins, loose herbs or wood chips over bundles I find them easier to use day to day though the both have their place.

8282,"Organic Safe and Natural Deodorant Tea Tree, Sweet Orange, or Unscented 2 oz.","
            Size: 2oz.
This natural deodorant has no harmful chemicals or ingredients like aluminum which is linked to breast cancer, or propylene-glycol which has serious health effects. This deodorant will give you proven odor protection.  We tested it.  After 30 hours, a hard working man had absolutely no odor with our original formula.  It is that powerful!
Instruction:  Apply a light amount on under arm.  Let oils absorb into skin.  Dress and go.  A little goes a very long way. Do not over apply the original formula.  Over applying may result in slight oil residue or irritation.  If using the 5% formula, apply as any regular deodorant.  
If you have just switched from a chemical based deodorant or antiperspirant to a natural deodorant, your body chemistry may need a week or two to adjust to the change.  You may experience some initial irritation as your body adjusts.
 No two people are alike as far as their body chemistry goes. Gender, age, race, hormone fluctuations, diet, health and even medications can affect body chemistry. 
Your body chemistry is an element to factor in  when selecting  a natural deodorant.  A deodorant that works well for one person may not work for another. A deodorant that works well in the beginning may not after time passes and your body adapts. Also, a deodorant that does not work at first, might work great after a little time. That's simply the nature of all deodorants, especially 100% natural ones.
Although some people use baking soda base deodorants without any problems, many are sensitive to the amounts of baking soda when used on delicate armpit skin. Human sweat is slightly acidic with a pH range of 4 to 6. Baking soda is about 8. The amount of baking soda used to create a product coupled with the natural pH of an individual's sweat can actually cause an irritation or even a burning sensation. 
As a result, we will continue to make the original formula for those who love it but have created the new 5% formula. 5% is composed of 3%-5% ratio of baking soda in the total recipe.  This means far less irritation while maintaining stink fighting protection.  If you've ordered before and want to order the same deodorant again, please select the original formula.  If not, you will receive the new 5% formula.  They are visibly unique. 5% has a slight gray color. 
If you have sensitive skin, always do a patch test on a small portion on the skin prior to use.  Sometimes it takes days or weeks for any reaction to develop. If an itchy rash or irritation persists, discontinue use.  Try swabbing with organic apple cider vinegar (acv) under the arms for a bit of relief while you find a natural deodorant that works for you.
   
If you have never used essential oils or are reluctant to try them, I also have it unscented.  Lock me in as a favorite and check back to see our NEW baking soda free option.        ",5.50,4.8235,"Handmade item

Etsy would prefer that I not include the description of any healing properties or make any medical claims about these products, so please feel free to do some research on your own as there is tons of information out there on this subject.

ORANGE Essential Oil (Citrus sinensis)
PALMAROSA Essential Oil (Cymbopogon martini)

8986,"ORGANIC Olive Oil Castile Soap, Unscented, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Vegan, Cold Process","
            Castile Soap refers to a soap made primarily with olive oil.  This is a 100% olive oil castile soap made with organic extra virgin, first cold pressed olive oil.  Olive oil has been used for thousands of years as a beauty treatment.  It is rich in the antioxidants A and E, and it is an effective moisturizer.  Many people use it directly on the skin before going to bed because it penetrates deeply and does not clog the pores.  In soap, olive oil produces hard bar with creamy lather that gently cleans the most delicate skin.  This soap is suitable for all skin types, but especially good for dry or damaged skin, and is gentle enough to use on baby's delicate skin.  
Handmade soaps retain all of the glycerin naturally produced during the soapmaking process.  To get the longest life from your handmade soaps, please choose a well-draining soapdish which allows the soap to dry between uses.
Ingredients:  Saponified organic extra virgin olive oil, first cold pressing
What you will get:  one hand-cut bar Olive Oil Castile Soap (3.5 - 4.0 oz), wrapped in a custom brown recycled paper label, ingredient list on back.
Convo me before going through checkout if purchasing several bars, or other items from my shop and I will create a custom listing just for you to save on shipping.

A necessity for any teething baby. The ""Bunny Ear"" teething ring is made with a cotton print top and super absorbent terry cloth back tied onto a natural, smooth, unfinished maple hardwood ring.
Many mothers swear by wetting the fabric tie and freezing to numb baby's sore gums. 
Fabric tie can easily be untied from the ring and washed with a normal wash cycle.

Dimensions: Wood ring - 3 inch diameter / Overall height 7.5 inches from top of ring to bottom of tie. 
Orders placed before 10 pm EST ship the next business day.

*Always inspect your product upon receipt as well as each time you give it to the child
*Children should always be supervised with wooden toys, even if they do not contain small parts
*Wood rings should not be submerged/soaked in water - spot clean only
*Do not put wooden rings in the freezer - only the fabric portion should be frozen.

            This listing is for 500ml of Ecopoxy
I was hesitant to enter the resin product market due to the obnoxious nature of most resins until I found EcoPoxyUV® . I love this product and obviously recommend it highly.
EcoPoxyUV® Available in 500ml and also in 1, 2, and 4 Litre lots. Click here for other Ecopoxy products and volume options...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The UVPoxy kit cures to a clear, UV resistant, glass-like finish that resists scratching and yellowing. This product will not blush or sweat under high humidity conditions. Its higher viscosity ensures it does not drip onto other areas.
Ideal for jewelry doming.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EcoPoxy® is a Plant based, 100% solid, waterproof, non-toxic, non-solvent, non-conductive, epoxy system that is Certified “GREEN”. 
Surpassing Southern California Air Quality standards it is virtually odorless and has an endless shelf life. 
EcoPoxy® has over 30 years of industry experience and has developed the “SAFEST” and “GREENEST” epoxy available today. 
 
Beginning with its ingredients, EcoPoxy® draws it’s strength and resource from the plants of the earth through its component of nuts and beans making it a truly revolutionary product. Carbon emissions from the use of these products are close to zero compared with the carbon emissions of other petroleum based resins. 
EcoPoxy® has been developed and tested by experts who believe that the more these products are used in place of petroleum based epoxies, the cleaner our environment will be. 
It is therefore priced to compete, and developed to take it’s place in a growing marketplace where “GREEN” is synonymous with value and responsibility. 
EcoPoxy® is formulated to be cured in a wide temperature range of 50-95 degrees and our resin is freeze/thaw resistant. EcoPoxy® adheres and bonds to fiberglass, wood, steel, aluminum, concrete, brick, tile and foam surfaces and delivers superior performance in a large range of applications. 
Our resins can be modified with fillers for many different uses.

            Succulent Plant - Mother of Thousands -  15 Tiny baby plants
On Etsy ... SPECIAL - I have so many babies ... this listing is for 15 tiny baby plants, as seen in the pictures. Full sun and dry conditions are what these plants thrive in. All you need to do is sprinkle them on dry sandy soil, put in bright light, water very lightly until the plant is established. They root very fast and easily and might already have little roots on them when I pick them off the leaf. 
Order yours today, before they get big and have a higher price! Care is needed when ordering during extreme weather. I do add some layers of paper and occasionally bubble wrap or other materials to help insulate shipments in the winter. Consideration of weather conditions before ordering is highly recommended.        ",5.50,4.9456,"Handmade item

17134,"Silver Stacking Ring, Sterling Silver Stackable Ring, Hammered Silver Ring, Petite Ring, Sterling Silver Band, Dainty Ring, Durable Ring","
            This is a listing for ONE durable sterling silver stacking ring. This ring is not made of thin, flimsy wire. It is designed to hold up well in everyday use. These silver band rings can be worn singly or as a set of stackable rings. They look best when worn in multiples. They also compliment other petite rings and dainty gemstone rings nicely. Each of these silver rings have been hammered to provide a beautiful and interesting pattern. Because of this, every ring will be different. These rings are about 1mm wide by 1mm thick, and weigh about .75 grams for a size 7 ring. This listing is for ONE sterling silver stacking ring. After each of these rings have been made, they are not just tumble cleaned. They are then polished by hand for a high luster finish.
These rings are made out of sturdy 16 gauge wire. (The lower the gauge number, the thicker and stronger the wire.)
These rings would look great when worn with my sturdy hammered 14k gold filled stacking rings, and my durable round sterling silver stacking rings.

The silver in this ring is sustainable. It was either made from recycled materials, renewable materials and/or are produced by manufacturing processes that employ ecologically sound methods.
Sterling Silver vs. Silver
I have been asked many times why I use sterling silver in my jewelry rather than fine silver or pure silver. Sterling silver is 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper. Fine silver, silver, or pure silver is usually 99.9% silver. Traditionally and currently, most jewelers use sterling silver to make jewelry. The reason for this is because fine silver, or 99.9% pure silver is a very soft metal, similar to that of lead. The tiny amount of copper that is included in sterling silver is added because it makes the piece of jewelry much more durable and able to maintain it's shape. Fine silver cannot easily survive normal use because it is very prone to scratching, bending, and denting. Furthermore, some more complex designs of jewelry simply cannot be made with fine silver because it is just too soft to hold it's shape. For these reasons, I follow the the longstanding tradition of primarily using sterling silver in my jewelry.
I strive to provide accuracy in my photos. All photos are taken in bright natural outdoor sunlight, using a Nikon D60 camera. No manipulation of the photos occur other than cropping to make them fit nicely. Please be aware that colors will vary from monitor to monitor.        ",5.50,4.9237,"Handmade item
