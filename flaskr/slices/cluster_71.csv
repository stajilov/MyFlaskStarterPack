614,SPRING SALE Boys Paw Patrol Patched Jeans Distressed Boys Jeans Boys Pants Paw Patrol Birthday,"
            Description
""PAW patrol is on a roll!"" and these jeans are perfect for your little fan of the show. Carefully selecting the print of each character for your little one, these jeans are designed to make any fan of the show excited. Our distressing techniques are sure to keep your young one in style with all the latest trends!
Unique
Every pair is up-cycled, distressed, and patched by hand. This makes each pair of Mountain Made Denim unique and individual. Since our products are one of a kind, the wash may vary between each product. That makes them made ""just right"" for you!
Versatility
Almost all our products are interchangeable, unless specified differently in the listing. So, if there is a special design of jeans/shorts that you want, but have another print of fabric in mind, let us know, and we would love to customize your very own pair! Please email us with any changes you have in mind.
Seasons 
Since we all want clothes for every season, each pair of jeans can be made into shorts, so your patchwork denim can be worn during all times of the year. Just shoot us an email and we can get to work on it for you. 
Sizes
Available in Boys & Girls, sizes 12 months to 5T. 
Larger Sizes
If you do not see a size that you would like, please email me. Shipping on larger sizes increases to 6.95 due to the weight of the extra denim. We ask that you order any size larger under ""Custom Order"".
Shipping
All jeans are custom made to order, and I am currently able to ship within 7-10 business days. Shipping costs are 4.14 for the first pair, and, 2.95 for each additional pair. If you would like them sooner, ""Rush Order"" (3-5 business days) is an option. Rush order shipping is 8.95, and 2.95 for each additional pair. 
Washing Instructions
Machine wash in cold water for best results. Do not apply direct heat. Hang or lay flat to dry. Drying in the dryer is at each customer's discretion, although it is not recommended as this could cause more fraying and distress on your pair of shorts/jeans. 
Your Vision
If you haven't found the exact patchwork design you are dreaming of, please email us with your idea. 
Thank you :)

            This is a chestnut camel brown vintage rectangular samsonite suitcase/luggage. 
 The interior is tan. There are some water, rust like, and mildew stains on the interior fabric, however it is dry inside, and has been stored in a dry environment, and unused for quite sometime. Measurements are 17"" H x 24"" W x 6.5"" Deep towards front latches, and 7.5"" Deep at bottom of case.
It's a lovely suitcase and all of the latches work. There are no keys. 
Unfortunately, these have come from a smoking home. I can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke, but this odor doesn't seem too strong, but I do want to make you aware that the odor may still exist depending on how sensitive you are.

            Superb Vintage Leather Gladstone bag, thick leather such quality, suede interior, very sturdy beautiful case.
I found this authentic leather bag at a French Brocante (antiques market) The leather has the most beautiful patina, with a suede interior in great condition for its age. This is a very clean item, with only a few marks and small defects considering its age, photographed on here, these add to the vintage look. Such thick, sturdy leather, still with such a shine, a true working bag. Used as a midwife bag, doctor’s bag. I think this bag must be from around 1920’s.
Measures: L 29cm x W 23cm x H x 23cm (with the handle) approximately.

I pack every item with great care and I send it within 1-2 working days. If you are sending it as a present I am happy to enclose I card which I can write for you.
If you are ordering from UK, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, I can send by Mondial Relay, which makes the shipping charge cheaper, and is still delivered direct to your home address. If you are ordering from France I also use Mondial Relay, and this becomes very cheap, if you don’t mind collecting from a Point Relais. If you would rather have the item delivered to your home, let me know and I can send via Collissimo which is a higher cost. If you want to purchase several items together, I can recalculate you a better shipping price, where practical, just contact me in advance.
Do not hesitate to ask me for more information, I will be very pleased to help you, and I like to please my customers.
Your feedback is always welcome!
Thank you so much for your visit!

10719,DVD Street Fighting Self Defense with Kata,"
            In this tape, Master Robert P. Moran illustrates how kata can be used in actual self defense situations. Kata is true karate and true karate is kata. The techniques used in point sparring are for sport, not real self defense. Indeed, the rules of sport karate ensure that no one is ever seriously injured! Further, kata are not dance-like series of movements, often set to music, that are only performed at tournaments and belt tests, but a master's set of of killing and maiming techniques (i.e., his method of fighting). This tape is approximately 60 minutes in length and will start you on the road to understanding of the true meaning of kata and of karate.	34.95        ",14.95,4.8667,"Handmade item

14640,Jewelry Crimping Pliers Crimp Tool Alloy Micro Bead US SELLER Fast Shipping,"
            Steel Jewelry Tools Crimper Pliers for Crimp Beads
These Pliers have a comfort handle designed for long term use. The actual pliers are designed to crimp the beads correctly for a longer wear of the extensions compared to a regular set of pliers. Good choice for all jewelry making applications
This tool can be used to crimp beads and tube beads with the sizes about 2mm-5mm. Use them to crimp beading wire, beading chain, illusion cord and stretch magic. These pliers are superior to chain nose pliers since the resulting crimped bead is neat, rounded and even. These pliers are for use with 2mm crimp beads
A crimping tool is specifically designed to squeeze closed crimps. Crimps that are closed by using crimping pliers will give smaller, rounder and stronger crimps; crimps closed flat by the incorrect pliers, can loosen, are not as strong, can scratch the skin and look less attractive.
Size: about 130mm long, 65mm wide, 10.5mm thick.

            A set of five dark Oak  branches that have been cut into varying lengths. Each varies from approximately 31 cm (12.5"") in length down to about 8cm (3 inches).  These branches had fallen from an old Oak tree, and are complete with a colourful array of various lichens and mosses growing on about 3/5 of them.

When we lost Carrie Fisher, I struggled to find a way to properly honor the woman who had such a huge influence on my life. I decided to make a pin to pay tribute to this bold and intelligent woman.
I also wanted to do something good in honor of her life as an activist and advocate for mental health awareness. A portion of all proceeds from this sale will go to The International Bipolar Foundation. Their mission is to eliminate Bipolar Disorder through the advancement of research, to promote and enhance care and support services, and to erase associated stigma through public education. In the first run of this pin, you helped raise 400 for The Thalians, a mental health advocacy group (Fisher's mom, the late Debbie Reynolds, was the president of the Thalians since 1957).
This pin is made from an illustration I drew of Fisher’s most famous role, Princess Leia, with her iconic A New Hope styling. It was a role with which Fisher had a complicated relationship, as detailed in her many memoirs. ""I've sort of melded with her over time,"" she told Terry Gross in an interview on NPR in November. ""The downside is the hair and some of the outfits. But I like Princess Leia. I like how she handles things. I like how she treats people. I- she tells the truth. She, you know, gets what she wants done.""
Carrie Fisher gave us Princess Leia by mining pieces of her own personality to create one of the most important characters of all time. ""I'm more of an archaeologist. I play what I am. I dig what I can. It's a character that's not too far from myself, except I don't have any laser guns,"" she said. Thank you for helping me honor this great soul and her life of advocacy and empowerment.
