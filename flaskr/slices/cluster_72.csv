Good condition for their age other then already mentioned..
A wonderful gift for someone who collects small dolls.

1280,Stunning TAG Heuer Aquaracer Full Size Divers Quartz Swiss watch,"
            This is a lovely first design of the sought after Tag Heuer Aquaracer series of watches still in production today.
 
When looking at the watch the first thing you notice is the strong uni-directional divers bezel which has sunken hour numerals  at 10, 20, 30 40 and 50 and raised batons at 5, 15 up to 55 and has a lume-filled dot at 12. It is in remarkably good condition for its age as you can see in the hi-def photos. 
The stunning dial has a lovely piano black two part design. The dial holds a big hour numeral at 12 and the remainder in batons. Below the 12 is the “Tag Heuer“ logo in the iconic green and red and above the 6 baton is ""Aquaracer"" and “300 Meters” underneath it. The chrome hour and minute hands are lume filled. The central seconds hand is also chrome. There is a date window at 3. The fast date change is still in operation
 
The watch case does show the usual scuffs on the bracelet and clasp but the actually looks lovely on the wrist.  Unusually for a watch of this age the sapphire crystal has no scores. 
The case measures 44mm lug to lug and 39mm across the including the crown guard and 42mm including the signed screw-in crown (screwed in tight). 
As with all Quartz watches the unique way the timing of the watches converts to the mechanical hands means that the seconds hand does not always hit the minute markers. This fact is highlighted on the TAGHeuer website and is normal. 
 
The watch is fitted with its original Tag Heuer steel bracelet that really compliments the watch.  The watch and bracelet will fit up to a 7.5 inch (19cm) wrist. 
 
You can see the lovely condition of this watch magnified many times in the hi-def photos.
 
As with all watches in my collection I provide a watch box to cushion the watch during its journey to you and so this watch comes with a luxurious velvet lined TAG Heuer travel case and cushion.  I also provide free worldwide postage so all you are paying for is this lovely watch.
 
Please have a look at other vintage watches in my collection including Swiss watches by Hamilton, Buren, Cyma Tavannes, Longines Wittnauer, Record, Eterna, Oris, Helvetia, Tissot, Timor, Vertex etc, American watches such as early Hamilton, Bulova, Elgin, Benrus etc, German watches such as Junghans etc.        ",794.64,4.9375,"Vintage item

The engraved glass design is repeated four times and covers the upper portion of the vase.  This tub style #1750 optic vase rests on a ball stem.  This cranberry vase was produced c. 1942.

This vintage Tiffin glass is in wonderful vintage condition with a beautiful “ring” when lightly tapped.  There are no chips, nicks, hairlines, cloudiness, repairs or scratches (except on the underside from placement).  It has some tiny imbedded bubbles from the making, and a tool mark with some pooled stain near the bottom (shown in the fourth pic).

3799,"Luxurious Autumn Haze Mink Jacket, Authentic Mink Fur, Real Fur Jacket, Blond Mink Jacket, Leather and Mink Jacket","
            High society delighted in fur and the coats have seen a revival in vintage clothing. 
This particular autumn haze jacket has been stored, glazed and cleaned with a professional furrier since it was purchased. It was top of the line in its day. The lining is in cotton satin. There is the name Liz embroidered inside. (You could purchase initial patches and hand sew them over that.)  The furrier is Lehrburger & Asher of Boston, Massachusetts.
There is leather under the collar so that it may be worn up or down.  There are two front pockets.  There is a leather belt that can be removed or used.  It is goes through two openings in the jacket itself.
It came from a smoke free home.  From the collar to the bottom of the coat, in back, it measures 26.25"". The front two pockets are 5.5"" long. There is one inside pocket that is 5.5"" long.  From the under arm armhole to armhole in front and in back is 21.75"".  From the shoulder seam to the bottom of the cuff is 23.5"". From the shoulder seam to shoulder seam at the top of the coat, it is 17"".  The scarf is 43"" by 7.5"".  It matches the lining material.  The belt measures 69.5"" from tip to tip.
It would probably fit from a size 10 to a size 16. Please read the measurements to be sure for you. We are not experts at sizing. 
This was purchased from an estate.
There are no returns.
This fur leather and fur jacket is in excellent condition. It is clean, soft and supple. There are no tears, wear spots or stains. Although we wish to sell, we prefer to have loyal, satisfied, repeat customers. We do this by fully describing every flaw that we see. We do not sell damaged items. You may buy with confidence.

Reinhold Visuals, c.1970 
Portfolio 1, Line
Image #18
18 x 24"" 
From the reverse: ""Barbarian Sacrifice,"" by Paul Klee (Swiss, b. 1879, d. 1940). Watercolor. 24-3/4 x 18-7/8"". Collection The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. 
A bold graphic poster used as a teaching aid in art and graphic design education. Printed on heavy cardstock, with descriptive text on reverse. This series of classroom posters was originally published in 1968, but I believe this to be from a later edition (most likely circa 1970). Ready for framing (frame not included). 
Minor scuffs from classroom use. Water damage across the top edge, resulting in staining and a slight wave to the paper. Pin hole at top center.

4641,"Vintage silver and matrixed natural turquoise bolo tie, unisex Western tie, Old Pawn turquoise silver bola, vintage bolo tie, gift for him","
            Here we have a very old bolo tie that looks and feels like a treasure passed down from an old grandpa, humble and simple. In the day it would have stood out for the gorgeous cabochon of Morenci turquoise, those chunks of white-gray mother stone mixed in with the blue. But the circle is off center, and the slide is completely hand shaped, and it's a somewhat crudely made piece, which makes it all the more endearing. We know it's old because it carries the Bennett Pat. Pending mark on the back, and we can see the tarnish from age. I recommend leaving the piece in its unpolished glory so that the vibrant blue of the turquoise stands out, as it does now, against the dark silver background. The piece is unmarked, and so we can't say with certainty that it is Native American, but I consider it a great example of true Old Pawn.
The bolo ""slide"" (the main part of the bolo tie) measures about 1-3/8"" wide at the widest point by 1-3/4"" long, with the turquoise cab being about 3/4"" long at the longest point by 5/8"" long. I've not polished the tarnish, and I will leave it to the new owner to determine whether and how much to clean.
Because some of the best pieces of art are the least flashy.

These gloves measure just 9.5"" from middle finger to cuff. They are snug on my modern size 7 so I think they are a 6 to 6.5.
Condition: Great, one pin hole on the right glove. A couple of pale yellow stains on the left one. Otherwise fabulous.

6026,Sampler of Each Hermit Crab Food Diet,"
            My Hermit Crab food is made with the nutritional needs of hermit crabs in mind. The nutrition that they need varies a few times a week, and they also like to have different foods offered to them. You should not feed them the same thing everyday, as they will be getting too much of one thing, or lacking something important. I made things simple by creating four separate meals for different days of the week, each with a different set of ingredients for your crabs to enjoy. It is good to offer both fresh and dried foods for your crabs. My four different diets together offer a wide variety of ingredients with many different nutrients, but it is important to also offer fresh (non-dehydrated) foods. Fresh foods should be offered in a separate dish, as the moisture from the fresh food will reverse the dehydration process.
My hermit crab food is designed to be fed as follows:
      Diet 1 (Crabby Medley Delight) is for the first 3 days of the week.
      Diet 2 (Surf & Turf) is for 1 day of the week.
      Diet 3 (Island Retreat) is for 2 days of the week.
      Diet 4 (""Meat"" Lovers) is for 1  day of the week.
Please Note: You do not have to serve the diets as I mentioned above. My hermit crab food is sufficient to be served alone; no additional ingredients need to be added to any of the diets, but you may mix diets together, add to them or serve them however you wish to. :)
______________________________________________________________________________
This listing is a sample of each of the four diets in my hermit crab food weekly diet. This should last a while depending on how much you serve at one time, or how many crabs you are feeding. This is 2.75 ounces total.
This listing includes:
1.5 ounces of Diet 1
.5 ounces of Diet 2
.5 ounces of Diet 3
.25 ounces of Diet 4 (this diet is very light in weight)
For an ingredient list for each Diet, please view the individual listings and view the Materials lists in the listings, or send me a message.
****AS A SOURCE OF FAT IN DIET 1 (Crabby Medley Delight), I am now using peanuts in place of Walnuts, in order to keep the costs of this diet low. If you or anyone that will be coming into contact with your hermit crabs' food, have an allergy to peanuts, please select the ""Just Sunflower Seeds"" option in this listing. I will be including double the amount of sunflower seeds if no peanuts are used.
Please note: 
***Specific ingredients are subject to change based on their availability to me, but shouldn't differ much from those shown. Weight amounts in photos may not reflect actual weight amounts. Ingredient labels in photos and materials lists may not reflect the current ingredients, as ingredients vary depending on their availability to me; please ask for a current list if there is any reason for concern. If you have allergies to anything that may be in any diet, please make me aware of this before you order so that I can replace specific ingredients with something else; I am happy to substitute them, I just ask that you send me a message before placing your order to make arrangements. :)
***I use nuts in the first diet and seafood in every diet, if you are allergic to them, or any other ingredient please make me aware of this so that I can substitute it with another.
______________________________________________________________________________
I have kept hermit crabs as pets since 2004, and I have learned so much about them over the years. My knowledge includes, but is not limited to, what is safe and beneficial for them to eat, and what is harmful for them to eat. A handmade/homemade diet is the best for them, and the best way to know that what you are giving them is safe. I have learned that some of the things that is currently on the market for hermit crabs is actually harmful to them, from chemicals/ ingredients they put in commercial food, and even the decorated shells they have available for them.
Everything that I make for hermit crabs is safe for them to eat, and I will not try to sell anything that my own crabs will not eat, and trust me, mine are VERY picky eaters!
If you have any questions, related to this item, or unrelated, regarding land hermit crabs, please feel free to ask, I would be glad to help. :)

7837,"Modern Patchwork Quilt : Diamonds in the Sea, Baby Quilt, Throw Quilt, Lap Quilt, Kid's Quilt, Toddler Quilt","
            This modern patchwork quilt features diamonds of fabric, enclosed into sweet little squares. The fabrics are used detail a underwater haven, complete with mermaids, seashells, coral, and sweet little fish spattered across. In shades of peach, coral, aqua, mint, and green, it is such a fun quilt that your little sea-lover will just adore! But best yet, it is deliciously soft and light, and something your little one will want to drag around the house!! 
Quilt measures 39 inches across and 49 inches tall.
This would make it a generous sized baby quilt or crib quilt, or perfect for your a child or even a throw quilt. It is tall enough to grow with your little one and later become a lap quilt.
It is backed in a variety of fabrics that all echo the colors and patterns on the front!  This quilt was made to be used!!
It is quilted in a way to echo the diamonds. Machine bound in a warm coral fabric with white x's.
All of my quilts are pre-washed, giving it that crinkly wonderful feeling that only comes from a freshly washed and dried quilt.
Made in a smoke-free home. 
If you have any questions, or would like to see more photos, please send me a message and I would be happy to oblige. 
Quilt care: wash in cool water, tumble dry low.        ",132.00,4.96,"Handmade item

This original art painting with its blues and browns draw you in and you constantly see new details emerging from this original canvas abstract art. The attention to the texture of this whimsical  tree allows you to escape into the forest for just a few moments. The flowers are especially cool in this painting as they have a metallic gold added to the centers which makes the flowers shiny and multi-faceted with the different colors of gold, and white. The unique design of the branch is based off some of the trees I have been seeing since my move to the Pacific Northwest. This artwork would look good in any room of your house, the office, or an elegant restaurant.
Thanks for visiting my shop! 
Oto T Jenkins :)

8499,Custom Broadway Playbill Framed Art Collage - Personalize It!,"
            Create a custom piece of Playbill art from all your favorite shows! 
This is an opportunity to have a custom made piece for you. Sometimes it's hard to find a unique way to showcase a cherished Playbill collection. They are expensive to frame individually, you run out of wall space or you get tired of looking at the same one. This is a fantastic way to display several of your favorites at once! 
Each piece I make is unique and one of a kind. You can select up to 8 different shows to make up the collage. I will take the best parts of each cover and arrange them to maximize the design. Please see the photos of several that have already been done. You will need to let me know what shows you'd like included. I have a very large stock to pull from but do not have every Playbill ever printed. If a special request is made for a Playbill I do not have extra time may be needed. In order to fulfill custom orders extra charges may be added if additional Playbills need to be purchased. No additional charges are applied without consent of the buyer. Base price for custom pieces is 68. 
SHOW SELECTION: Please consult the list below. If you'd like to request a show that is not listed below please contact me before purchasing to make sure I have it. YOU MUST GIVE ME 10 SHOW OPTIONS. This is in case I do not have 1 or 2 of the selected shows. When placing the order please put them in order of preference with the last 2 being the alternates. 
These make wonderful gifts for Broadway fans! A memento of a trip to see shows in NYC or a collage of productions someone has worked on or been in. 
""Love love love this piece of artwork. Thanks so much. Fast careful delivery""
""such a great way to commemorate!!""
""it's the perfect gift for anyone who is a musical theatre enthusiast. Just wonderfully made!""
""I love how this turned out and they were so helpful during the process""

Please do not hesitate to ask for ANY show. I have over 600 shows on file to chose from. If there is a specific Playbill cover you are looking for from a show please specify. Periodically a show will change its Playbill cover and I have no way of know which one you're looking for unless specified. I will also always attempt to use color Playbill covers but please be advised that I can not guarantee this. Also be away that many shows never print color Playbills and therefore they will not be available.

Done well and in a timely manner. Couldn't be happier with how it turned out. 
Very nice painting, looks great. Very well packaged. 
Love love love it! I sent him a picture of my colors in my room and the painting couldn't match any better!!

9516,"Life Size Pose-able Alien Facehugger model - 40"" x 23""","
            This is a huge life-size facehugger model inspired by the movies Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection. When assembled, it measures 40""L x 23""W 2.5""T. The tail was extended for the measurement, as were the legs. 
The model is jointed and pose-able, and the joints are stiff enough for the model to support it's own weight.
This model is incredibly detailed, and looks great unfinished but would look absolutely epic painted.
This is a listing for the raw parts to make the model, fresh off of my 3D printer. This model consumes about 62 hours of printer time, so I'll need at least a week to turn it out and get it in the mail to you depending on my workload. 
You will receive 76 parts to be assembled. If you break a part during assembly, email me and I will send you a spare free of charge. I'll number the parts on the flat side to make assembly go smoother!
If you'd like me to assemble it for you, add 20 and a couple days to the turn around time.
You'll need a tube of Krazy Glue (4g maximum bond), and some sandpaper/rotary tool to flush the seams. I you really want to go above and beyond, coat it in XTC and smooth it out, prime it, and paint it for an over-the-top display.
This thing is a work of art, and was created by Agisis on Thingiverse.  
Not your thing? Well, check out my other designs here:

This is a 3D printed product, so there may be minor defects (rough edges, bumps, etc). I have spent months building my own machine to exact specifications for accuracy and surface quality, and I scrutinize every model very closely. I use only the highest quality filament to ensure colors are vibrant and defects are kept to an absolute minimum for both your item and my machine. 
Every item in my shop is test printed and checked for not only aesthetics, but also the intended use. All of my items I list I personally test to ensure they meet my stringent standards. All items are printed in PLA, an organic non-toxic plastic made from corn and is biodegradable, yet very strong. PLA will not degrade under normal use, but will break down when buried.  
If I'm not happy with it, it doesn’t ship. You will get my very best work, which you will find is a cut above the rest!
All of the credit for the design of this model goes to Agisis from Thingiverse. This can be found as thing 1116392.
Please note, this creation is a work of fan art and is in no way affiliated with Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. You are paying for the 3D printing service I provide in duplicating a 3D model found on thingiverse.        ",59.99,4.8638,"Handmade item

10526,Lowest Price Ever!  Vintage Working 1960's Sound Electronics Corp. X305 Tube guitar Amp,"
            Price lowered! Was 1000 - Now 600 for a short time. Don't miss out!
This is a really cool ""Sound X305"" all tube guitar amp made by the Sound Electronics Corp. of Mineola, NY back in 1966. From our research on this amp, we found that these were hand made and hand wired and are very hard to find especially in working condition. The construction is still very solid and the amp sounds great. Because of it's age though, this should be looked over by a tech. There are carrying handles on both sides to make transport fairly easy. This pushes out about 30 watts of power according to our research. There are 2 channels and each channel has two 1/4"" jacks. It has built in tremolo with controls for speed and depth and it has a massive 15 "" Jensen special speaker that sounds awesome at any level.  The amp also takes expression pedals very well. We used this with both a Vox Tonelab setup and a Digitech setup and the amp sounded great with both. They both actually helped to push out the bottom end so you could hear the Jensen speaker flexing it's muscle. 
The tolex on the cabinet is torn in spots and shows the most wear along the two front sides. The faceplate could be cleaned up with metal polish, but we didn't want to take a chance on maybe destroying the lettering. One other thing we noticed about our amp compared to pictures of other Sound X305 amps is that the badge on our amp still has the original blue color to it. Pictures we have seen on the other amps shows the blue is gone completely, or almost gone. 
The amp measures 21"" long x 11"" wide x 28"" tall and weighs about 50- 60 lbs.
The shipping cost is based on shipping to the west coast. If the shipping cost is less to your residence, then the difference will be refunded.        ",600.00,4.96,"Vintage item from the 1960s

All cufflinks ( unless otherwise specified) are considered costume jewelry. We use the descriptions of any stones from the manufacturers titles when they were first produced. When we refer to the stones as moonstone or jade or garnet, for example, we are using how the original manufacturer of the pieces used them. We cannot guarantee the authenticity of a stone in a costume piece of jewelry.

16802,POST TAX SALE Uplifting Mala Beads Faceted Botswana Agate Antique Rudraksha  Rosewood Thai Silver Healing Anti Depressant Stability Positivi,"

These stones are simply beautiful.  This mala is strung on latte nylon c-lon thread hand knotted for stability and strength. Finished with a natural hemp and handmade german silk tassel wrapped in contrasting latte thread. Wraps around the wrist x5.
**** Tassels are the latest jewelry fashion trend, however the tassel has a deep rooted spiritual meaning . The Tassel on a mala is the marker of the 108th bead, the most auspicious number. Tassels represent enlightenment and opens the third eye. Buddhists think of the tassel threads as the roots of the lotus flower, ( rising from the muck and depths to blossom into a beautiful flower).
************************
Total Mala Length 40""
8mm Faceted Botswana Agate
Rudraksha Mala Guru Bead 18mm
*************************
Botswana agate is sometimes called the ""change stone"" because of its mystical property of helping one handle change in a positive way. It is said to gently help one make transitions of any kind. Relief from depression and/or grief is another metaphysical energy of Botswana agate. It is said to help us focus on solutions instead of problems. It increases creativity, as well as the power of one's intuition. Botswana agate is helpful in overcoming addictions and other self-destructive compulsive behavior patterns, as well as dealing with repressed emotional issues.
Rosewood is associated with the heart chakra, rosewood is a compassionate and healing feminine energy; that doesn’t mean that it’s only for women! It just means it helps to accent the innate qualities of compassion and love within an individual. The feminine grace is enhanced when wearing rosewood, and intuitive health is also given a boost.
Rudraksha seed beads are dried seeds from the Rudraksha tree. They are used in the Hindu culture to create sacred garlands. Rudraksha trees grow on mountains and hilly regions of Nepal, Indonesia, Java, Sumatra and Burma. Rudraksha evolve from the eyes of Lord Shiva, ""rudra"" means Shiva and ""aksha"" means eyes. Aksha also means a group of alphabets in Sanskrit called (Varna). Rosaries made out of Rudraksha Beads in auspicious numbers like (1081, 541, 271) are called Rudraksha Malas. The 1 bead is called as Sumeru (Guru), it is not crossed while chanting, and is considered the boundary for returning in the reverse direction for further counting. The guru bead or bindu bead has 5 faces, for shiva.
Malas are used for mantra meditation and healing. Your mala will come in a complimentary natural muslin pouch for convenience and protection. It will include a detailed description of your stone's healing properties, and how to meditate and care for your mala. Packaged perfect for gift giving or great storage for you!

            Dark gray pleated skirt, Pleated skirt for women.
The skirt made of high quality dark gray chiffon with inner lining. There is a hidden zipper on the back and button on the belt.
This is not a vintage pleated skirt, this is a new hand made pleated skirt, the folds are made especially for me.
I found a small workshop, in south Tel Aviv, specializes in pleated folds. The folds are made according to the traditional method with my instructions. I decided on a 2cm reclining fold, the distance between the folds just seemed to work perfectly, very gentle and pleasing to the eye.
Tip from me ♥
A beautiful flattering outfit lifts up the mood. It’s important to match the item to your body structure and not give in to passing trends that often suit only few.

19456,Moon forgot - linen skirt pants (K1206b),"
            A storm came,
The boy asked in sadness:
Would you still like to listen to the rain under the umbrella?
The moon nodded, 
so he opened an umbrella for her,
Rain, 
began to play a light and soft Di-Dar rhythm.
Can’t see, does it mean doesn’t exist?
Remembered, does it mean won’t forget forever and ever?
The tide is getting quiet, 
The ocean freezes into a black mirror,
A night without moon feels especially cold,
But the deepest night will be over inevitably,
The moon came…
Jimi (Illustrator artist) – Moon forgot

THE CREATION OF YOUR WALLET (applies to all Mr. Lentz Leather Goods)
Now, there aren't too many people makin' wallets with as much care as I do, so I thought I would share the process with y'all:
♦Every morning Mr. Lentz wakes up and brews a pot of Cowboy Coffee, you know - the grainy type with a bit of grind still left in the cup. Sippin' on this, he enters his workshop and pulls out a large 'side' of raw, full-grain, vegetable-tanned leather. Usually a roll of about 24 square feet, of leather smellin' goodness. From this roll he will plan out the day's cuts, which pieces will be best used for wallets, and where the most interesting natural markings lay. Mr. Lentz will then start the cutting and punching process, shaping the wallet down to the millimeter using a series of sharp knives and precision cutting tools. 
♦From there, it will be carried over to the Mr. Lentz logo branding machine, a beast of a tool that is capable of over a thousand degrees of heat. The brand is set in place and the logo is impressed on the surface...a sweet smell of singed leather fills the air with a puff of steam. Next, the wallet is carried over to the sequential number machine, where Mr. Lentz first sprays on a bit of water into place before adjusting the machine and pulling down on the lever to set the numbers deep into the leather. This number signifies the order in which the wallet or other leather good was made in the history of Mr. Lentz Leather Goods. It is sequential right from the start of Mr. Lentz's early work, and he has a book to account for every item and number marked. 
♦If you chose to personalize your wallet, then Mr. Lentz will heat up another branding tool, as well capable of over 1,000 degrees. The letters are hand placed into the tool in the old-fashioned typesetter's way, then the wallet is again sprayed with a mist of water. Mr. Lentz will hold the branding tool above the wallet, carefully aligning the initials in place, then with a quick and brisk movement, the numbers are pressed and held into place as the tool brands the leather.  
♦If you ordered the Western Brown version, your wallet will be taken over to another table where it is immersed in an all-natural vegetable based dye, created weekly by Mr. Lentz himself. It is non-toxic and safe for Mr. Lentz to use without gloves! After the wallet is immersed in the dye, it will then be pulled out and hand-rubbed down to even out the color. It is then set out to dry in the natural heat and wind of the Southwest's desert air for several hours. Once fully dry, the wallet is brought over to be oiled and conditioned. Mr. Lentz is proud to say that he makes his own leather conditioner from all-natural materials as well. It is the same leather conditioner that he ships free with every wallet as a can of Spiff N' Shine (also hand-filled! ) The wallet is set on a table and rubbed down from side to side with a few layers of an oil-wax mixture. This process is then repeated on the backside and over again until the wallet has fully absorbed just the right amount as to be soft and pliable. 
♦Once oiled, every wallet is hand-buffed with a soft cloth before each rivet is placed into the leather, one by one. The rivets are assembled together with several hundred pounds of force, creating a super-durable and tight fit... one that will last a long long time. The wallet is then hand hammered into shape, thus keeping its tightly made corners and folds. 
♦Each wallet is then fit with a paper sleeve made from recycled materials, and attached with a free tin of Mr. Lentz Spiff N' Shine. Then, finally - after a day or so of work - it is off to the postal service to make its way to you and your pocket. It will last you a long long time. 
Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed hearing about all of the work that went into this purely handcrafted piece of leather goodness!
