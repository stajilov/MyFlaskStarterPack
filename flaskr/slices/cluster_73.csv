            Pictures of my brother wearing these vertical striped shorts that he wishes my mom lost.  Why? Because she paired it with a horizontal striped top.  Such was the look in the 70s.   Bright yellow, dark blue, orange, light blue and some white...lots going on in one pair of shorts.  Super retro.  Zipper and snap close.  
Health-tex brand
No material details, but feels like a heavy cotton.
Belt hoops all in tact.
Elastic in the back still has stretch.
Does need some minor repairs along the stitching in several spots.   Easy enough if you sew.
But no sewn repairs or patches.
No stairs or tears.
Original zipper and snap.  All in working condition.

2231,Antique Victorian engraved Sterling silver buckle bracelet 925,"
            This stunning antique bracelet jewelry is an antique Victorian buckle bracelet in Sterling silver.  The engraving s beautiful, featuring a bird, which is a popular Victorian motif.  There is a blank area on back which I believe might have been left open to have perhaps a name engraved, but luckily, none was ever added!  There is also another area on the front by the bird which might work well if you wanted to have a loved one's initials engraved at your local jewelers, turning it into a wonderful family keepsake!
The bracelet is Sterling silver and as you can see in the photos, is quality stamped.  It measures 7 1/2"" in circumference, so for someone who's wrist measures say 7 1/4"" around or less.
This  bracelet does have a buckle clasp, but it is not adjustable to different sizes. It does have a hing and opens and closes to put it on, so unlike a bangle that you hav to be able to get over your hand, this opens to put on at the wrist.  This makes the bracelet ideal for gift giving, as long as you approximately know the measurement around the wrist.
I do have som additional pictures available if you need them, please message me and I can send them....I am only allowed the 5 pictures in my listing.        ",111.81,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1800s

            Vintage Art Deco 1930s thermoset glitter double side cufflinks and shirt stud set.  7/16 across tops x 1/4 inch deep.  Very unusual set, with a pink glitter set in the bottom of the thermoset which makes them stand out. Plated brass, which is darkened in places from age.  It is amazing that the set is still complete and hasn't been broken up over the years.  They show some age mostly on the metal, the brass has show through, and some signs of corrosion / darkening in places. The studs work, one is a bit tight.

            A small blue glass bottle ideal for kitchen or bathroom use.  Probably 1970s.
Made in Belgium moulded on the base. These sapphire blue glass bottles were made in various sizes. I am assuming they held bath salts originally but could be used in the kitchen too. The plastic stopper is good. 
3.5 inches / 9 cms tall including lid. A few small scratches but hardly noticible.

Due to the success of my 1st Etsy Shop Cartref Eclectig which sells both vintage clothing and vintage patterns I have decided to open this dedicated pattern and sewing shop. 
Over the next few months I will be migrating patterns over however whilst this is happening you pay only one shipping on patterns no matter which shop you purchase from. So check out all my listings there are over 600 patterns between both shops 
https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/CartrefEclectig
or
https://www.etsy.com/uk/your/shops/TheArtisanStitch
Shipping
I ship world wide, all patterns are packed in individual clear plastic sleeves to protect them and their contents. You pay only 1 postage fee on sewing patterns no matter how many you buy
Top Tips for Using Vintage Patterns
1. Early patterns may not have any markings, limited instructions and are often one size so are more difficult to use than modern patterns.
2. Like vintage clothing vintage patterns may fit smaller than modern patterns so it is always advisable to check your measurements against the pack.
3. Weather new or used we always recommend you press your pattern before cutting to ensure an accurate fit.
If you have any questions please feel free to drop me a line happy to help

            These boy's vintage blue jeans by JCPenney (size 6) would be perfect for the trend-setting, retro boy in your life!  They are in GOOD vintage condition.  NOTE: These jeans fall within the ""good"" category due to the following imperfections noted while photographing- There is some slight discoloration on the front, lower, left leg as well as the back, lower, right leg as well as wear on the back right pocket and just above it.  I feel these imperfections add to the vintage charm of the garment though and certainly don't detract from it!

These vintage NOS pants were obtained from a closed hardware store in Michigan. During WWII the owner decided to purchase a hardware store while her husband was away at war so that when he returned they would have a business to ensure their employment. This shirt was stored in that very store all these years. You are truly buying a piece of history. 
Many more deadstock clothing pieces to come, and pieces for men and boys are available here:

            Really nice *imitation suede in the Kelly/emerald green… Nice deep pockets with flaps, two button front closure, two buttons at sleeve, single vent, fully lined comfortable box cut. There is some discoloration in the lining of the sleeves and there are a few spots of discoloration from storage, most noticeably on the left sleeve top outside... It looks like there was a sticker placed on this at some point and for whatever reason it caused fading in that specific area (photographed) If you wear it at night it is very unlikely that it would be noticeable. This jacket is hand washable, can be dry cleaned too.

4907,1x Roll Unsorted Unopened Lincoln Wheat Cent Penny Roll Old US Coins Lot 1909-1958 P D S,"
            This listing is for 1x roll of Wheat Pennies (50x pennies per roll) dated anywhere between 1909-1958.  
I have accumulated over 600,000 wheat pennies.  The pennies have not been sorted by me as it would take me a lifetime to go through them all so I simply ran them through the counter and machine crimped the end.  There can be any mix of dates between 1909 and 1958 and any mix of mint marks (P, D, S).  I make no promises of key dates... Sure, you could find a great coin or a rare coin, but keep in mind rare Coins are RARE. Chances are, you won't find a rare coin, but these rolls are a nice way to help out a collector looking to add to their collections or albums without having to buy a truckload of Pennies at once!

5132,"Vintage Bird Cage Music Box - Dancing Musical Birdcage Wind Up, Japan","
            An adorable vintage bird cage music box. It's shaped like a birdcage, with a small bird inside that moves its tail to the music when wound. There is a switch on the base so you can turn it on and off. I do not know what song it plays.
Marked ""Product of Japan"" on bottom. It's about 6"" tall not including the loop handle, and about 5"" at the widest. Please note, this is offered AS IS, very dusty, with some rust, and the bird no longer moves its beak. Also the movement sometimes stops and needs a bit of coaxing to get going again. I have priced accordingly.
I am always happy to answer any questions or send more photos when needed.

Excellent vintage example of a Guatemalan Huipil
Width 33.55""

Today, looking at weaving in Guatemala is like looking at a piece of the past.  The building of roads, new marketing patterns, tourism, greater bilingualism, factory-made clothing, new yarns and dyes are changing this art. This and all indigenous art forms in Guatemala are under stress as a result of globalization of the world's economy which is why owning part of this art is important as a Guatemalan, Non- Guatemalan, Historian and Collector or just a common person with love of weaving and history.

5899,Antique Victorian Era Black Tissue Silk Long Collar,"
            This is an unusual piece of Victorian era clothing. The actual collar consists of 4 layers of tissue silk. The collar attaches at the neck with an eye hook. From the neck black silk cascades in fine pleating to give a very dramatic effect.
Condition 
Various holes to the silk throughout, these are all well hidden within the pleating of the silk. Only noticeable when one opens the pleats. Considering the age of this piece and  tissue thin silk the overall integrity is good. Price is fair in regards to condition.
Collar around the neck measures 
18 inches from hook to eye.
From neckline to longest drop is 25 inches
This is an antique piece and is not in perfect please ask questions as returns are not accepted

            Vintage collar, Stiff / False collar, Men's starched, white cotton, detachable shirt collar, Turn down, Stand-Fall collar, Van Heusen, Sz 17
DESCRIPTION
Vintage detachable / false collar.
- Classically styled, stiff, turn down shirt collar with stylish point.
- Front and back button holes for attaching collar to shirt, (two shirt studs would be required).
LABEL
Attached label is VALTONA by Van Heusen, No 4.
SIZE
The marked collar size is 17
Collar spread is approximately 6cm.
FABRIC TYPE
The collar is starched cotton. 
CONDITION
Being vintage the item has been pre-owned but remains in good vintage condition with some minor indications of its age. I have noted a small mark on the collar stand, see picture reference.
Being an original vintage collar the item has been stored for a considerable length of time. Overtime the old starch has starting to discolour slightly to a cream tone, (this is a very typical characteristic of old starched collars). The starch can easily be washed out and restarched if a purer white collar is required. Professional starching maybe required if horse shoe quality is desired.
Please see picture reference for confirmation of condition.
Photographed stud is NOT included in the sale of the collar.
Sorry about the postage cost but without folding the collar it will need to be boxed. If you are happy for me to fold the collar then this will reduce the postage cost, message me for a quote.

            Gorgeous Hermes silk scarf designed by French artist Annie Faivre.  This lovely and rare scarf features the letters HERMES in the center.  Each letter is created with the depictions of different animals.  The colors are the colors of the forest.  Greens, browns, yellows and some blue grey.  It is signed A Faivre and has Hermes - Paris on one of the corners.  The original care label is still intact.
The scarf has never been used and comes packaged in the original orange Hermes box.   I would be happy to provide additional photographs upon request.
""Annie Faivre is a French artist, who has created numerous carres for the Maison Hermes.  She has built her reputation on her unique style, which is immediately recognizable and now loved by so many.  Her association with the Fashion House began in 1979, and 36 years and many scarves later (I believe 46 in all), she has a loyal fan base the world over and it is not uncommon for her scarves (first issue) to sell out.""

  Solid walnut wood base

  Includes antique style Edison light bulb
In an age where technology seems to rule everything around us, it's easy to find ourselves longing for a time when life was simpler.   The Edison Light creates a nostalgia for a time gone by – a time when books required the turning of a page, not the touch of a screen, when we received letters in the mail from friends, not quick text messages on our cell phones, and when an evening with the family was spent talking or playing a game, not watching television.  Imagine your own space, in your house, apartment, or office, sitting in your favorite chair, reading a book or writing, with the Edison Light illuminating your environment and reminding you that amidst the frenzy of technology, it is always important to slow down and enjoy the simple things in life.
The Edison Light makes a beautiful, unique gift for that special friend who loves antiques, and also makes a wonderful housewarming present.

------------------------------------------
NOTE ABOUT COLORS:
I mix colors for made-to-order items as needed. Please describe your ideal colors and I will be happy to accommodate most any request. If you would like to send a color example via an etsy conversation, I will do my best to match the color you provide. However, please allow for slight color variance, due to how colors appear differently on screens and monitors.
NOTE ABOUT SIZE:
Due to the nature of working with wood, the size listed is approximate. The actual dimensions may vary by a half inch in either direction.
NOTES ABOUT THE WOOD:
The wood I use is dependent upon what is available at that time. No two pieces of reclaimed or locally milled, rough-sawn wood are identical. Please do not expect your item to look exactly like the example in the photo. Your item may or may not feature embedded nail heads, wider or thinner boards, different wood grain, texture, knots, etc. In addition, if you choose to have your sign stained, I always use the same ""Dark Walnut Stain"", however, your sign may appear slightly lighter or darker than the signs pictured in this listing. The wood grain may feature MORE or LESS contrasting tones.  This is what gives reclaimed wood charm and character.... each piece is truly one-of-a-kind!
The back is left unfinished with a sturdy picture hanging wire attached for easy hanging.
Please review all policies prior to purchase and contact me with any questions.... I look forward to creating for you! Thanks so much for browsing! - - Caitlin        ",45.00,4.9779,"Handmade item

7899,Basil Mandarin Tea Light Candles - earthy candles - scented candles - scented tea lights,"
            Basil Mandarin gives off a clean, fresh scent with an earthy aroma. 6 tealights per box.
Notes:  Lime, basil, amber, mandarin, moss, patchouli.
We are constantly busy with how fast paced and convoluted the modern world can be. A tea light is a small and simple piece that can break through the chaos and create a calming space to take a step back. It gives us a peaceful atmosphere that offers simplicity and in a world that constantly barrages our senses. A tea light candle holds the sophistication and elegance of a regular candle, while adding a luxuriously private and personal feeling in its small size.
- Created with quality fragrance oil and premium soy and paraffin blend for the clean burn of soy and great scent throw of paraffin with lead and zinc free cotton wicks.
- Tealight comes in heat resistant, clear polycarbonate containers that are recyclable and measure 1.5” wide and 0.75” tall. 
- Hand packaged in a box of 6, each tealight burns up to 5 hours.
- Products meet ASTM quality and safety standard.
- Wax is dye-free with smooth, opaque and creamy appearance.
- Each tealight is poured and wicked by hand, one candle at a time, to ensure quality and performance.
- Free shipping with no minimum purchase. 
Safety Tips:
• The best option to hold tealight candles are holders that are specifically made for tealight candles. Similarly sized holder will keep tealights from moving around and therefore provide a safe burning environment.
• Clear cup tealights are not to be used in enclosed or covered tealight holders such as tart burners, tealight houses, and lamps. The heat can build up inside an enclosed holder and melt the clear cup. These candles are for open style holders.
• Keep trimming the wick to ¼ inches. A longer wick leads to a larger flame which is more dangerous than a smaller flame.
• Keep the candle away from drafts. Drafts can create an uneven burn and excessive smoke.
• Keep the candle away from flammable objects. Do not place the candle near curtains or other fabrics or beneath anything that can catch fire.
• Avoid placing a tealight on top of a plastic surface, even if it is in a holder. The heat still runs the risk of producing a fire.
• Keep the candle away from children and pets. Accidents can happen!
• Never leave burning candles unattended. Keep them within sight at all times.        ",18.00,5.0,"Handmade item

7929,Navy blue Clock- Farmhouse Clock- Reclaimed Wood Clock- Small Wood clock- Wall Clock- Rustic Clock - Number Clock- Pallet Clock- Round Clock,"
            This small pallet clock comes in sizes 12""-18"" (picture in listing is a 16""). It has been made from reclaimed pallet boards. The  numbers have been painted white and the base of the clock in navy blue.  There has been distressing throughout.
    *** PLEASE NOTE*** This is a custom made clock repurposed from pallets. Your clock will vary from the one pictured as each board will be different. The wood we use for our clocks are untreated and have sat outside for months, even years, and does show signs of weathering such as chipping ,cracking, knots, insect damage, rusty nails, natural formations in the wood. The wood will also shrink or swell depending on  the climate. There will be gaps between the boards and may not always fit perfectly together. However, we feel this adds to the rustic/vintage charm of the clock. If you prefer boards that will fit together better, I can purchase new boards from my local lumber store. At checkout, in the ""note to seller"" box please let me know that you would like new lumber.
  Our current wait time on a clock is 2-3 weeks due to our volume of orders. We strive to get it done as quickly and early as possible. The clock mechanism and hands will be packaged separately to avoid any damage to the hands while in shipping. ""AA"" battery not included.

8183,Pineapple Door Hanger // Pineapple Welcome Sign // Front Door Decor // Pineapple Decor,"
            Invite guests into your home with our gorgeous Pineapple Welcome sign!  This pineapple door hanger is a cute and fun way to spruce up your front door decor.
[DETAILS]
- 23.5"" tall and 15.5"" wide
- 1/2"" thick
- engraved with the word ""welcome"" in lower case letters
- two 1/2"" holes are cut in upper leaves for using ribbon to hang the sign.  Listing does not include ribbon or hanging materials.
[FINISH OPTIONS]
1. The sign can remain unpainted.  It will be white as in the picture.  Paint is not necessary, but it makes a big difference to smooth the finish and seal the edges from getting dirty (dirt can adhere to bare edges and will be very difficult to clean).  For unpainted choose Unfinished DIY at checkout.
2. These signs can also be purchased unfinished for a DIY project to be painted by you.  They can be sprayed directly with a spray paint meant for plastic surfaces or primed and painted with any paint or spray paint.  For this option choose Unfinished DIY at checkout also.
3. The sign can be purchased painted one of our Little Bubba standard colors.  Look at the color chart and select which of the 12 colors you wish to have painted.  As stated before, painting (even white) goes a long way to smooth the finish and seal out dirt from ruining the edges of the sign.  Front and sides will be painted the color of your choosing; back remains unfinished.
4. The sign can be painted 2 colors.  If you are interested in traditional pineapple colors (green and yellow) check out the listing for our ""aloha pineapple"" to see an example.  
https://www.etsy.com/listing/505077719/pineapple-door-hanger-pineapple-aloha?ref=shop_home_active_1
5. Finally, if you have a specific color you are looking for, let us know!  We are able to color match just about any standard pantone color. Just message me about what color you are interested in, and we will go from there!
Please keep in mind, colors may vary due to differences in monitors!

            Truly speaking, I didn't suspected existing of such a thing as Shaving Scuttle, until I was asked to make one. 
This is really wonderful creation to keep something warm. 
As woman  - I prefer chocolate or to warm babys porridge:)
But I can imagine this stuff very suitable for shaving.
So - all you do is add hot water in the second chamber, so it will warm surface and keep it warm for lather until you finish your shaving. 
This one is dark blue, with dot engraving inside. It helps  to mix lather.        ",45.00,4.9286,"Handmade item

            This is a custom order so fabric choices may vary. Please specify if you would like a specific theme (girls/boys, animals, chevron, etc.) or color scheme. Custom orders will ship in 1-2 weeks. I always strive to get custom orders sent out earlier than deadline. 
This colorful fabric alphabet and number set that is fun and educational for any child. This set of letters & numbers would make a wonderful addition to any child's toy collection! A great visual tool when learning the alphabet song, counting or spelling words when your child begins to read and write. Each letter is a different fabric design to help with letter and number identification.
This is a full set of capital alphabet letters (26 total letters) and ten numbers (0-9).  Additional letters and numbers can be purchased for 1 each (non magnetic) or 2 each (magnetic).  Please message me about what letters you would like and I'll create a custom listing for you. 
The letters and numbers are approximately 3 inches tall. They are cut with pinking shears to help ""raggedy edged"" letters to help maintain their shape over time.  They are 3 layers thick. Top layer is 100% colorful cotton fabric. Middle layer is batting. Back layer is soft felt in white.
***Magnetic Sets include small thin strong magnets.  The magnets are small and thin so as to be almost undetectable by those little hands playing with them. Strong enough to stick to the fridge but not so strong that they snap little fingers. Magnets are glued and sewn into sets, but because the magnets if removed could be a choking hazard, Magnetic Sets are not recommended for children under 3 years old. ***
Comes with lined drawstring pouch/bag to contain the letters when not in use.        ",45.00,5.0,"Handmade item

9277,"18"" Memory Bear / Keepsake Bear from Adult Clothes **PLEASE Read Item Details for Info**","
            My current turn around time is 10-12 weeks from when I receive your items, not your order date. Thank you for your patience and understanding! 😊
This listing is for the 18"" Memory Bear / Keepsake Bear from Adult Clothes ONLY. I do make the 18"" Memory Bear / Keepsake Bear from Baby Clothes also. If you are looking for those, this link will take you there:
 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/229806717/18-memory-bear-keepsake-bear-from-baby
 
 -For additions to your bear, see the ""Additional Options"" link within this listing. 
I love the idea of being able to carry a loved one with you. These ""one of a kind"" memory bears are perfect for those who have had a loved one pass away and would like a bear made in their honor.
I make your special bear from clothing that you send me.
A bear can be made from one men's medium shirt or larger, or women's large or larger. You can send more than one shirt if you want them mixed together. If what you want to use is a youth size or a women's x-small, small or medium, I will need two shirts per bear.
Some great ideas from adult clothing are:
***Non Stretch Fabrics*** :
-Button down shirts
-Flannel shirts
-Flannel pajamas
-Fleece shirts
-Fleece pajamas
-Flannel or Fleece bath robes (knee length or longer)
-Cotton dresses (knee length or longer)
-Cotton skirts (knee length or longer)
-Corduroy items - pants or jackets
-Denim items - jeans or jackets
-Uniform shirts
***Stretchy Fabrics*** :
-T-shirts (please keep in mind that if there is a large logo on your t-shirt, that it may not all fit on your bear)
-Golf/Polo shirts
-Sweatshirts (please keep in mind that if there is a large logo on your sweatshirt, that it may not all fit on your bear)
-Cotton knit/t-shirt dresses (knee length or longer)
-Cotton knit skirts (knee length or longer)
With items that are stretchy, I iron in an easy knit stabilizer to help control stretching and maintain shape.
If you have specific items you would like to use other than what is listed above, please contact me BEFORE placing your order.
Materials that can't be used:
-loose knit items
-handmade crochet or knit items
-sheer or lace items
-silky or thin satin items (like night gowns or blouses)
-nylon or nylon blend items
I sometimes use your item's buttons for the eyes and a small piece of felt for the nose. If there are no buttons to use, I will use safety eyes. I try to use any emblem or logo from the shirt if it will fit onto your bear (unless specified not to). The neck is double stitched (since it's the part that gets the most lovin' 😉). 
Additional Options - If you would like any additions to your bear (such as: a ribbon bow around the neck, bow or bow tie, fabric tag, embroidery, or a neck tag), please see this separate listing for ""Additional Options"". These options will need to be purchased IN ADDITION TO your memory bear.

To see all of my memory items and other listings, please visit my shop at:
 www.MySewWhatShop.etsy.com 
ORDERING PROCESS:
1. Add this listing to your cart by selecting shirt/fabric type, number of items used per bear, and the number of bears you would like to order.
2. If there are any additions you would like with your bear (ribbon bow, bow or bow tie, fabric tag, etc.), add those to your cart too. 
3. Check out. Once I receive your order confirmation, I will send you an Etsy convo with the address you will need to send your item(s) to.
-Please send your items to me within a week of placing your order. This helps keep your order within the estimated turn around time given in your order confirmation.
-Please be kind and wash all items before they are sent to me. It is GREATLY appreciated! Items with heavy odors will be returned to you using the shipping cost from your order, and your order will be cancelled. This is not meant to be taken offensively, but I work very closely with these items and appreciate your taking the time to freshly launder your items I'll be working with. Thank you!!
-Please be sure to put your FIRST and LAST NAME on your package. If you send your item(s) from a business address or without your name, it takes me a lot of time to figure out who the items belong to.
4. When I receive your items, I will Etsy convo you to let you know they have arrived here safe and sound.
5. You will get an Etsy convo from me the week I have your order lined up to work on.
6. You will get an email with your tracking information when your order is on it's way to you.
Care Instructions: It is recommended to spot clean your bear with a mild soap or detergent. Air dry. 
NOTICE: While every care is taken to make your bear safe and strong, it is intended as a keepsake only. Should you wish to give this to a child for gentle play, that is your decision, and therefore your responsibility to supervise their play, as small plastic parts are used.
**The bears in this listing are not for sale. They are examples only.**
Made in a smoke free home.
Thank you for looking and have a BLESSED day!
This last paragraph is for new or other shop owners looking for ideas on how to set up their own shop or item descriptions:
Please do not copy my listing description details into your own. I spent a lot of time in thought and worked very hard to make sure my details were not like someone else's and would appreciate it if you'd do the same. I do look around at other shops from time to time, and have found my exact words and phrases being used in Shop Policies and item descriptions. It is against Etsy's policies to copy another shop owner's work. Copying anything in my ""MySewWhatShop"" Shop Policies, detailed descriptions, pictures, etc. for your shop is plagiarism and WILL be reported to Etsy as an Intellectual Property Infringement. While I am flattered that you like the way I have set up my shop, it is much more appreciate if you use your own creativity and not copy mine. Thank you!!        ",45.00,5.0,"Handmade item

9469,"Fine Silver Tar Valon Mark  on Amyrlin letter, Wheel of Time officially licensed merchandise.","
            This was struck  in 1/4 troy ounce (8 grams) of pure .999 silver. These coins were made using ancient techniques, so Each coin is unique due to that we used a silver ball to make the coin. These coins have a non uniform rim with some cracking. The obverse features the face of Siuan Sanche, holding a flame on her open palm, flanked by seven stars and wearing the stole of the Amyrlin Seat, striped with seven colors. The reverse side features the ancient symbol of the Ourobouros, the snake eating it’s own tail, used to symbolize eternity and the Wheel of Time. In the center of the reverse side is the Flame of Tar Valon, official symbol and seal of the White Tower and the Amyrlin Seat. The letter reads: 
""What the bearer does is done at my order and by my authority  Obey and keep silent, at my command. 
 Siuan Sanche 
Watcher of the Seals 
Flame of Tar Valon 
The Amyrylin Seat
The framable document with coin comes in a 9″ x 11.5″ hard plastic top-loader sleeve for protection..
 Each order comes witha  custom certificate of authenticity. 
Based on The Wheel of Time™ series by Robert Jordan.  We have officially licensed with Bandersnatch Inc. to produce the coins that would exist in the world defined by Robert Jordan’s fictional works. This is our second entry in the series.
In the tale, the Amyrlin Seat provided documents on rare occasions to individuals in her service. The master copy of the document was calligraphed by Renee Troy, and bears these words: “What the bearer does is done at my order and by my authority. Obey and keep silent at my command.”
These coins were designed here at Shire Post Mint, approved by the Bandersnatch Group, and struck here at our own facility in Arkansas. The obverse die featuring the face of the Amyrlin Seat, was hand-engraved by master-engraver Ron Landis, widely known for his work with Gallery Mint Museum. The coin blanks are individually melted and flattened, such that each individual coin is unique… some even showing cracks and flaws at the edge just like many ancient real-world silver coins.
Here at Shire Post Mint we are dedicated to the principle of creating artifacts from worlds of fiction and mythology in order to create tactile touch-pieces to help fans immerse into their beloved fantasy worlds. We work closely with authors (or their heirs) and highly skilled numismatists and die-engravers to create pieces with the utmost of authenticity.
My name is Tom Maringer and I make fantasy coins under the trade name Shire Post Mint. These  coins (or ""tokens"") are made here in my workshop in Arkansas. There are now five people working here, but I still run the main press at least part of the time to maintain quality control.        ",45.00,4.9867,"Handmade item

9899,THE SPAMP Guitar Practice Amplifier And Distortion Effect,"
            THE SPAMP is a guitar preamplifier, distortion effect and headphone practice amplifier in a conveniently sized enclosure which can be free standing or clipped on to your belt.  The circuit is an original design, not a clone of any stomp box and not designed to emulate any particular sound.  
The main signal path is a distributed gain JFET amplifier. The very high input impedance presents minimal loading to the pick-up resulting in a wide, flat passband which sounds great. There is no tone or EQ control – use the control on your guitar or amplifier head.
SPICE adjusts the gain prior to the distortion stage.  This controls the amount or harshness of the distortion.  
HEAT adjusts the post distortion signal level going on to your amp or following effects.
CHILLED no distortion, just the warm tone of JFET amplification.  You can of course persuade a distorted output in CHILLED mode by winding up SPICE and or HEAT! 
FRIED a subtle application of even harmonics for a warm fuzz.
GRILLED introduces odd harmonics for a meatier overdrive distortion. 
LINE IN    a 3.5mm socket intended for connection to a line or headphone level source from a mobile phone or other media player. A 3.5mm stereo male – male cable is supplied for this. The stereo input is mixed into a mono signal and added to the guitar output path.  This is a unity gain buffered pass-through, it won't boost the volume of your iPhone!  Use the volume control on your media player to adjust the output level of the mixed in source.  
‘PHONES  a 3.5mm output socket. THE SPAMP is optimised to drive headphones with a nominal impedance of at 16 to 32 ohms.  
The amplified guitar output is mixed with left and right channels of the headphone output so you can play along without disturbing your parents / partner / children as applicable.
Using THE SPAMP 
First of all, open the battery compartment and carefully connect a 9V battery to the clip. Try not to strain the wires. If pulled excessively they might break or be pulled off the circuit board. THE SPAMP has reverse polarity protection so don’t worry if you momentarily connect the battery backwards. 
THE SPAMP is energised only when a ¼ inch jack is inserted into the input socket. At risk of teaching you to suck eggs (which go well with Spam®) make sure the HEAT control is fully anticlockwise (low gain) and that there is preferably a guitar on the other end of the lead. If you plug in an open lead and the gain is wound up with an amp or headphones attached, you are likely to get a good, loud dose of mains hum. 
When THE SPAMP is activated, the yellow LED will glow. 
If a ¼ inch jack is inserted in the output socket, the headphone amp is automatically switched off to preserve battery life.  The output impedance is lower than 1 kohm and will have no difficulty driving following effects or your stack.  
When you use THE SPAMP for the first time, introduce it gradually to your guitar and amp. Start off with SPICE and HEAT set to about 9 O’clock – roughly 25% gain. Likewise, turn your guitar down to about halfway and your amp to something that won’t freak your cat / dog / neighbours, etc.
Play around with the settings on your guitar and THE SPAMP.  
THE SPAMP is equally happy with single coil or hum-bucker pick-ups.  Experiment to get the best sound with your set-set up.  Try it with the neck pick-up selected and the guitar tone turned right the way down for that old fashioned overdrive sound.  
The SPAMP Story
Early one morning, before bed time, in about 2001, Spamp Man returned from a gig feeling somewhat peckish. Enraptured by the ensuing Spam® sandwich, Spamp Man received the inspiration for the Spicy Amplifier, THE SPAMP. A prototype was knocked up using the very can that provided the meal of enlightenment. And there the story might have ended but, in 2016, Spamp Man decided to share THE SPAMP with the World...
THE SPAMP was designed by SPAMP MAN and all SPAMPs are assembled to a professional standard and 100% tested by SPAMP MAN himself.  
Shipping
All SPAMPs are shipped by Royal Mail 1st class signed-for in the UK and by Royal Mail Tracked and Signed overseas.  Orders should be shipped within 3 days of receipt and will be confirmed.

            Fun set of 6 large wooden dice! Fun for any age, perfect gift for the hard to buy for family member. Personalize your bucket!! Each bucket will say ""Yard Dice"" as shown in the first photo, unless otherwise noted in notes to seller. 
To choose your vinyl color for the ""Yard Dice"" decal and Personalization (if desired) leave a note a checkout to seller including:
1) Color of Vinyl for ""Yard Dice Decal"" (if none is indicated, the decal will be done in white)
2) Personalization (if desired). Please include the placement for personalization and color (see photo 4 for examples)
This set includes, 6 wood dice, galvanized metal bucket, score cards for Yahtzee (Yard-zee) and Farkle. 
Each dice is cut and sanded. Then stained with a beautiful walnut stain, then painted with white dots. Finally the dice are sealed for protection from the elements. Dice measure approx. 3 1/2"" squared. 
A few things to note::
   Dice are made from wood and will have some natural ""flaws"", including cracks and knots (which we think makes them even   more beautiful)

10241,Interlocking Corn Hole Boards Raw--DIY--Hideaway Cornhole Board--Cornhole Boards--Bean Bag Toss--Stow Away Cornhole,"
            Maximize Space 
Minimize Effort 
Wanna Know How These Work? Check It Out on our store home page.
What is this product:
 Most of the time when corn hole boards are made to be portable they lose their quality. This collapsible option keeps the quality of the board enacted while making them portable. These are corn hole boards that can collapse so that they are the width of one corn hole board. These boards come with handles so when they are collapsed onto each other two people can easily carry it. Check out our video on our shop page to see it in action. These boards are made of 3/4 in plywood. This is a durable material that will keep its form throughout weather conditions etc..
Dimensions:
48in x 24in x 4.5in
It is 50 lbs. ( not a problem for two people to pick up together)
Shipping:
It comes assembled through USPS.
Color:
If you order this product it is strictly raw with no finish, if you would like to purchase painted or stained corn hole boards please see the painted corn hole boards posting. 
Why we created this product:
Cornhole is a great game for the summer and football seasons, but once the winter hit and we had to put the cornhole boards away they became a nuisance. We created these cornhole boards for this reason. We can play with them during the summer and fall. But once it is time to put them away we can store them away without taking up as much space.

10600,"Vintage batik guitar strap -- shades of aqua, peach and black","
            The fabric of this strap is a vintage Indonesian batik sarong fabric. I bought the fabric in the 1980s and only had one length of it, so only a very small number of these straps can be made. The colours are shades of blue-green/aqua and peach on a black background, with a pattern of stylised flowers. This fabric is 100% cotton, which gives the strap a lot of stability to hold its shape as well as being comfortable to wear and stunning to look at.
As a musician you create beauty in the form of melody, harmony and rhythm, and connect with people through emotion, passion and joy. I make my straps with a similar attention to the harmonious balance of aesthetics, form and function. They are made by hand in my home studio on the rural outskirts of Sydney, Australia. Whether you’re looking for a new strap for yourself, or as a gift for someone else, you will know that a MyMumDrivesaUFO strap has been made by someone who is doing what they love. 
My straps are very comfortable, strong and hard-wearing. They feature: 
•	Hand-shaped and hole-punched black leather ends
•	2inch wide black polypropylene webbing (rated to 250kg breaking strength)
•	100% cotton fabric, lined with medium weight fusible interfacing to add a layer of softness and cushioning
•	chrome-coloured metal adjustment fittings
•	length adjustable to approximately 154cm (60 inches) 
I do my best to ensure that the photos of the straps accurately reflect their colours. However, computer screens can vary in their reproduction of colours. If absolute colour accuracy is important to you, message me to request a fabric sample before purchase.        ",31.08,5.0,"Handmade item

These are specifically for the father of the bride, but can be any name, date or saying of your choice. The discs measure 5/8"" in diameter and are 16g sterling silver. We will also stamp on the back of these a special secret message for you.
*Please note these have sterling silver discs and silver plated backs. We do also sell solid sterling silver cufflinks (front and back) on our store.
When you checkout, please specify what you want stamped on the cufflinks (front and back) and where you want it stamped (i.e., outer perimeter, middle).

Please remember that if you want a monogram, the first name initial goes first, then the last name initial, then the middle name initial.

Hand stamping is a process where each letter is individually stamped into the metal. Each letter may not line up perfectly and some letters may be deeper than the others. This is not to be considered a defect and adds to the charm of each piece. This process is much deeper than engraving.        ",45.00,4.7654,"Handmade item

            These tie bars are made from Sterling Silver.  They are part of the textured tie bar series.  I use many different textures and tools to get many variations on the tie bars.  This specific style is a matte variation.  I use a stippling wheel to achieve a brushed texture.  This gives the tie bar a beautiful matte finish that is both smooth and elegant.  Great for any occasion and matching the elegance and smoothness of the silver.   The silver also makes it all the more dapper, perfect for any occasion from formal to casual! Not to forget super special as well.
These tie bars are approximately 5mm wide and are 2 inches long.  Please let me know if you have a specific length / size in mind. I am happy to make tie bars with custom measurements. 
Tie bars make great gifts and keepsakes! For anyone of any gender. Especially nice to give for: job promotions, baptisms, graduations, bridal party and groomsmen. 
Please message me with custom order and commission tie bars ( including: stamping, initials, gold, other metals, Mokume Gane, Diamond and other stone setting)!        ",45.00,5.0,"Handmade item

Stay traditional with our white clays - they are easy to shape, decorate and paint! Avoid the hassles of a kiln all together, if you wish  because our natural clay will air-dry completely within a couple of days and you can paint them with acrylics.  Air drying is not recommended for utility use as they are not air tight.  This clay is excellent for taxidermy clay use. For utility use, this clay can also be fired in a kiln at cone 06!  
Or mix up your routine a little and try some earth red clay.  It is smooth and pliable, making it ideal for modeling pots, sculptures, and other fun classroom projects! Let your project air-dry or harden with a  kiln (Cone04-06 rating).  Once finished, your creation will have a reddish, earthenware color.  Crafters and classrooms have been thrilled with this clay!

It measures 4' Tall, 21 1/2"" Wide, when the legs are opened the A frame design is 12"" deep, but the legs fold down to 4"" for easy transport.
This unit has 43 Hooks and if you only need to use the lower section it has 17 Hooks.
Also the unit breaks down fast into two sections just by unscrewing four round head bolts with wing nuts on the back on each side.
Unit will ship with the two back braces removed for smaller shipping, but all you do is tighten the screws with a screwdriver.
As always if there is a display you need just ask and one will be made for what ever craft you sell.

15731,"Vintage Heart Shaped Cookie Cutter, Punched Tin Cheese Mold, Farmhouse Kitchen Decor, Heart Shaped Mold, Unusual Valentines Gift","
            This pair of vintage tin hearts both feature pierced designs. The heart shaped cookie cutter has a strap handle, a punched star design, and a scalloped rim around the heart. The other piece seems to be a punched tin cheese mold or strainer. It has concentric hearts punched into the heart backing as well as having pierced sides. There is a small handle on top; the base is affixed to the sides with metal tabs that are bent up and soldered. 
Size: 3 by 3 inches cutter; 3.5 by 3.5 by 1.125 inches mold. 
Condition: The tin of the cutter is darker and there are some areas of light rust; the soldering is a bit crude. The cheese mold has some light surface rust. There are gaps between the sides and bottom of the mold – I believe this may be a homemade tramp art type piece.

✦ ABOUT GOLD FILLED ✦
✧ Gold filled is an actual layer of gold-pressure bonded to another metal.
✧ Gold filled does not flake off, rub off or turn colors.
✧ Most people with jewelry sensitivities can wear gold filled without worries of any allergic reaction.
✧ Heirloom jewelry from the 1800’s is often gold-filled which gives us confidence that it will last a lifetime!
____________________________________________
✦ GOLD FILLED CARE ✦
✧ Warm water and a soft cloth are the best thing you can do to maintain the beauty of your jewelry.
✧ Jewelry polishing cloths work great and are non-abrasive.
✧ For a deeper, occasional cleaning, a drop of dish soap on a toothbrush will return its luster.
✧ Salt water and chlorine in swimming pools take their toll on all fine jewelry.
✧ Many chemicals marketed for cleaning jewelry are actually somewhat abrasive or corrosive and can cause damage or color alteration to your jewelry.

____________________________________________
Each piece of Haley Lebeuf Jewelry is individually crafted in the Austin, Texas studio.  Pieces will have slight variations due to the nature of items made by human hands.  Great effort is put into each item to ensure the highest quality, finish and durability.
____________________________________________
METALS | Items are predominately crafted in sterling silver.  In some instances, argentium silver is used.  Haley often uses 14/20 gold fill, which is a great answer to rising gold prices.  It is best described as a thin sheet of 14k gold fused to a base metal core.  This creates a layer of gold generally 100x thicker than gold plating.  Metals will be specified in each item description.
SHIPPING | Items are packaged in a pouch with a white polishing pad (safe to use on all jewelry) and a black anti-tarnish strip.  We are happy to provide gift wrapping; please leave a note in the checkout section.  Generally, packages will ship within 1-3 business days.  If for some reason items will take longer, you will be contacted by HLJ.  
International shipments may incur custom charges.  HLJ is not responsible for these charges.  Please see http://www.dutycalculator.com/ before purchasing.

19096,"Forged Iron Bracelets, hand forged iron, blacksmith bracelet, set of three","
            Hand forged iron bracelets. Set of three 
Dramatic and sure to be noticed...each bracelet is handmade by me in a coal forge, shaped on the anvil, brushed, and finished with wax to prevent rusting and add shine.
I now have three sizing options available... Please take the time to measure as these cannot be bent. I recommend taking a bracelet that fits you and measuring it across the middle.
Small: diameter of 2.5 inches - 8 inch circumference
Medium: diameter of 2.75 inches - 8 1/2 inch circumference
Large: diameter of 3 inches - 9 inch circumference
***Please note that you will need a larger size for this bangle Since it is a closed bangle, it has to fit over your hand.***
The important measurement is that it is able to slide over the hand without bending. Keep in mind the circumference of these is larger than wrist size to accommodate for that.  A good way to figure out your size is to grab a piece of string and squish your hand down (as if you're preparing to pass a bangle over it) take the string and wrap it around the biggest part of your hand and measure it very tightly. Then compare that measurement to the sizing above and select the bangle that works best for you.  Also, if you are buying for someone else and it's a gift, the most common size is medium. If you're unsure it's always best to go bigger than smaller.
I am available to do custom sizes. Please contact me with any requests.
