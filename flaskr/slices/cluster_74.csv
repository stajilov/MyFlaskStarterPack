283,Original Genuine GOYARD Malles Aime Paris RARE Art Deco Antique leather trunk with interior fittings,"
            Antique and original leather luggage Courier Trunk Malles GOYARD - Made in Paris 1920s Art Deco era– Inspection can be arranged - please ask for quote for delivery - very rare to find with its original fully marked canvas webbing insert fittings and tray
  *********************  Now cleaned and sensitively restored  *********************
Believed to date 1920s - 1930s - Located Hertfordshire UK
An amazing find at auction recently - this is a 100% genuine antique Malles Goyard AIME heavy leather small case/courier trunk with rare to find original top tray and mesh crate that lifts out - totally authentic
 (Emails sent to Bentley's London and Goyard in France and confirmed as genuine) - 
the response from Goyard stated -
""Thank you very much for your email and attached files I received yesterday. I do confirm this trunk to be made in our Parisian workshops around 1930. It is a standard size ""small courier"" trunk, with its specific handle on top.""
Dark patina with heavy duty leather construction throughout - well lined (GOYARD AIME) on the webbing crate and fitted top tray - original travel labels - you will not find another one like this.
(OK I decided a light restoration clean and wax would not hurt) - it has taken over 80 years and who knows how many 1000s of miles of travel to achieve its look and patina - the locks and corner plates are brass polished up brightly and the leather work now cleaned and treated to look like the one on sale at Bentley's - only this one still has original travel stickers so far more character
Apart from the expected wear and tear (or patination of its age) the only real damage is that there is a small .25 inch piece missing out of the left side securing clasp - but it is still opening and closing and secures the lid firmly in place. (see pictures) 
Otherwise some dinks and digs that come through general use over the last 80 or 90 years.
I will happily hand deliver the item worldwide to ensure its safe arrival and special handling. May even work out cheaper than insured courier services. Feel free to contact and discuss..payment plan also available if needed.
Have a look at similar items on the Bentley's site for Vintage GOYARD Pieces and you will see some amazing prices.

HISTORY - Goyard is a French trunk and leather goods maker. Established in 1853 in Paris, and previously doing business as Martin (Pierre-François Martin founded the
 House of Martin in 1792)[1] and then Morel,[2] it is the oldest such organization still in business, older than Louis Vuitton by one year.[3] François Goyard
 (1828–1890) made box making, packing and trunk making the family’s trade when he purchased Maison Morel, successor to Maison Martin. Edmond Goyard
 (1860–1937) expanded his business from 1885 to 1937. Robert Goyard (1893–1979) was the face of the brand during the booming post-war years. François
 Goyard played a significant role in further increasing the firm’s growth with his daughter Isabelle Goyard (1959-). Jean-Michel Signoles bought Goyard in 1998,[4] and turned the privately-owned company into an internationally renowned brand.        ","2,651.90",5.0,"Vintage item from the 1920s

1616,Izmir Vintage Turkish Kilim Rug 1,"
            Izmir is a pretty impressive guy - an old soul that hails all the way from Turkey. He is a traditional kilim that sports the traditional geometric shapes which are a signature design of the  Barak nomads and created using vegetable dye.  A unique statement piece and one of a kind, Izmir can be your own little slice of Turkey in your own home.
Styling:
Kilim rugs are the perfect statement piece of any room and can brighten up a dull room, instantly soften a space or add a little boho to your home. They are pile free, making them perfect for a space that has high foot traffic. For more styling inspiration, you can visit my pinterest board.
Dimensions:
192cm x 305cm
Care:
This rug should be shaken outside or vacuumed every week. If you have minor spills, attend to the stain with water as soon as possible. For longevity ensure you vacuum regularly and get him professionally cleaned once in awhile.
Notes:
Izmir is as authentic as they come. Given he was handmade and vintage, he has a few imperfections giving him the handsomeness of a rugged older gentleman, but that is part of his appeal. If you want to see more images of him before purchase, please contact me.        ",932.47,5.0,"Vintage handmade item from the 1970s

3149,"Vintage Boys Pyjamas Pattern, Unopened, Practical Patterns 5569, Ages 9 - 12, 1960s, 00684","
            Great unopened vintage Boys Pyjamas pattern by Practical Patterns to fit ages 9 to 12.
This pattern, which is still sealed in the original envelope, was published by Practical Fashions Ltd, London, in the 1960s. It is Practical Patterns number 5569.
The pattern gives a choice of long or short pyjama trousers and a jacket with either a button-up round collar or an open shirt-style collar.
Chest measurement to fit 28 - 30in / 71 -76cm.
The pattern envelope is in very good vintage condition given that it is about 50 years old! There is a crease down one side and some other minor creasing around the edges and corners. As the pattern is still sealed it is assumed that the pieces themselves are also in very good condition, although obviously this can't be verified.

3368,"Boy Scout Shirt, 1970s Olive Green Uniform, Boy Scout Patches, Eagle Scout Badge, Long Sleeves, Unisex Clothing, Scouting Uniform","
            Nice looking vintage olive green Boy Scout shirt from the early 1970s. The shirt is long sleeved and has patch pockets and the original fleur de lys buttons. This is a great collectible, but large enough for an adult to wear (see dimensions below). 
The shirt has:
* An Eagle Scout badge on one pocket
* A red, white, and blue square knot patch above that pocket
* The Boy Scouts of America strip
* Shoulder patches for Troop 457
* A round red and black bear den patch (on the opposite sleeve)
* A tag that says Boy Scouts of America, Official Shirt
The shirt is in very good condition, with a little pilling on the fabric but no tears or holes. There's a little color variation where a patch was removed, but no stains. 
The dimensions, with the shirt lying flat, are:
* 17 inches across the shoulders
* 20 3/4 inches across the chest
* 27 3/4 inches long (from nape of neck in center back)
* 22 1/2 inch sleeve
Please compare these to a shirt of yours to see if it will fit.

5037,"Italian Collectible Plate, Richard Ginori Plate, Vintage Italian Plate, Antique Ginori Plate, Vintage Hand Painted Plate, R Pinelli","
            Rare antique hand-painted Richard Ginori Italian gold gilded porcelain plate.  It measures 8 ¾ inches in diameter and is decorated with gold trim at the rim and hand-painted leaves, vines and grapes or berries in colors of white, pale yellow, pink and green.  This collectible plate is in very good vintage condition for its age.  It has no visible chips or cracks, but does show some color loss of the gold around the edges.  The front is signed “R. Pinelli”, and the back is marked “Decorazione Eseguita da Richard Ginori” and “Ginori Italy Hand Painted” and ""057"".  My research indicates this plate dates to the Victorian era before 1900.  This is  a nice find and would make an elegant display piece.        ",95.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1800s

5919,Vintage Ladies White Cotton Handkerchiefs with Applique hand Embroidery ; White on White  108,"
            All three of these white cotton handkerchiefs are in great shape.  They all have a white on white design.
A  Picture 2 This hankie measures 12 by11"".  It is unique because it has the same applique and embroidery work on all 4 corners.
B Picture 3  This hankie measures 12 by11.5"".  It is unique because it has the same embroidery work on all 4 corners and there is a border around the hankie that was created by changing the weave in the fabric.
C Picture 4  This hankie measures 12 by 12.5""  It has no design etc.  It is a white light weight cotton handkerchief.
 
 Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions and/or would like pictures.  
All measurements are as accurate as I can make them but the possibility always exists that they may be off 1/8” or so.  Please keep in mind that these are vintage pieces – at least 20 years old- often used (unless stated otherwise) and may have minor signs of wear.  I make every attempt to identify and disclose them, but there may be some very tiny ones I miss.
Interested in more than one item? I do combine shipping. Due to the size of some larger items, combined shipping isn't always possible. I will credit your account for the difference between what you are charged and the cost to combine the items for shipment.

7616,ECO_ il cuscino profumato imbottito di lavanda tessuto a telaio manuale,"
            ECO è il CUSCINETTO PROFUMATO, 
imbottito di lavanda, CHE AMA L'AMBIENTE!
La sua fodera è tessuta manualmente a TELAIO e realizzata con materiali 100% ECOLOGICI RICICLATI
COME NASCE LA FODERA DEL CUSCINO ECO?
Partendo dalla condivisione delle tematiche ecologiche del riciclo, mi sono chiesta cosa potessi realizzare per mettere in pratica l'idea del RI_USO nell'ambito delle mie creazioni tessili.
E' nata subito l'idea di ECO, IL CUSCINO  al PROFUMO DEI RICORDI...
In onore del RI-USO ECOLOGICO dei TESSUTI INUTILIZZATI ho iniziato a tesserli e a dar loro una forma... 
E' stato sufficiente aggiungere qualche cucchiaio di lavanda e pula di farro come imbottitura ed è nato così il CUSCINETTO PER PROFUMARE DELICATAMENTE LA BIANCHERIA NEI CASSETTI E NEGLI ARMADI...
BIANCHERIA FRESCA E PROFUMATA 
PER INIZIARE AL MEGLIO LA GIORNATA! 
...niente di originale, ho semplicemente aggiornato l'idea per RIDURRE GLI SPRECHI in uso nel passato per riciclare e non buttare via niente, riconoscendo alle cose e al lavoro in esse custodito il loro prezioso valore intrinseco.
L'uso principale dei cuscinetti ECO è certamente quello di profuma biancheria, ma non escluderei altri usi originali come quello di aromatizzare la borsa che porti ogni giorno con te, profumare l'abitacolo della tua automobile, come fermacarte per colorare la scrivania su cui lavori... 
Insomma, potrai usare ECO ogni volta che necessiti di un buon AROMA COLORATO!

_________________________
The amount of water you consume everyday plays an important role in maintaining a healthy body. Experts recommend drinking eat least 64 ounces of water each day to maintain good health.
Here are 7 benefits of drinking enough water:
1. Relieves Fatigue 
If you often feel tired, there is a high chance that it could be due to inadequate consumption of water which makes the body function less efficiently. In fact, fatigue is one of the first signs of dehydration.
When there is less water in the body, there is a drop of blood volume which causes the heart to work harder to pump oxygenated blood out in the bloodstream, and other major organs also work less efficiently. Thus, drinking adequate water can help your body function better and reduce fatigue.
2. Improves Mood
Research indicates that mild dehydration (even one or two percent lower hydration level of hydration than optimal) can negatively affect your mood and ability to think.
A small study conducted on 25 women and published in the Journal of Nutrition found that being dehydrated can take a toll on your mood and cognitive function. The color of your urine is a good indicator of your level of hydration. The lighter the color the better the level of hydration and vice versa.
3. Treats Headaches and Migraines
If you have a headache or migraine, the first thing that you can do to get some relief is drink plenty of water. Headaches and migraines are often caused by dehydration.
 
In a study published in the European Journal of Neurology, researchers found that increasing water intake helped reduce the total number of hours and intensity of headaches in the study participants.
4. Helps in Digestion and Constipation
Water also improves the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. This helps in digestion and prevents constipation. Inadequate water in the body often results in constipation as the colon pulls water from the stools to maintain hydration, thereby making them harder and difficult to pass.
Drinking sufficient water boosts your metabolism and helps the body properly break down food. This helps your digestive system work well and promotes regular bowel movements. Warm water, in particular, is good for digestive health.
5. Flushes Out Toxins
Water is an excellent detoxifier as it helps flush out toxins from your body and get rid of waste primarily through sweat and urine. It also promotes kidney function and reduces kidney stones by diluting the salts and minerals in urine that cause kidney stones.
6. Regulates Body Temperature
An ample amount of water in the body also helps regulate body temperature. The thermal properties of water and its ability to release heat from the body when sweat evaporates from the surface of the skin greatly helps maintain an even body temperature.
A well-regulated body temperature also will make you feel more energetic when exercising. Water also helps keep your joints and muscles lubricated, thus preventing cramps and sprains.
7. Promotes Healthy Skin
Water keeps the body well hydrated and improves capillary blood flow, which promotes healthier and younger-looking skin. Water helps replenish skin tissues, moisturizes skin and increases the elasticity in your skin.

9953,Custom Color GameCube Controller,"
            CONTENTS
1 Refurbished (or New) First Party GameCube controller
DESCRIPTION
I love the Nintendo GameCube, but let's face it the color selection available is just too small! Not any more with Moose Customization GameCubes controllers! This item includes a controller specially themed to make your GameCube stand out! The combination of paints used in this set is designed to be long lasting and durable whilst emulating, to the best of my ability, the original aesthetic gloss of the GameCube. The paint also has a clear coat that negates any feeling of ""stickiness"" that tends to be present on painted gaming devices. If you want additional pictures or info about the painting process, feel free to request them.
All controllers are made to order in predefined styles with more styles coming soon!  If you want a custom color scheme make sure you send me a message with your color choices and any decals you want. Custom choice also include a draft in photoshop to ensure you are getting exactly the style you are looking for. BUTTONS AND THUMBSTICKS WILL NOT BE PAINTED, SHELL ONLY!! This is due to the paint not sticking to the rubber/plastic and wearing out within days.
CREATION TIMETABLE
The stock of this item represents the number of spots I have available to paint. Once you order painting will begin ASAP, with orders being done in the order they come in. Depending on the workload and your place in line, it will take 1-4 weeks to complete and ship your order. If stock is empty I'm either out of controllers or backed up on orders; stock SHOULD come back daily!
POLICIES
Price is non-negotiable. Video evidence of the game working, being packaged, and sent out is kept and can be requested at any time. Due to the refurbished nature of the product refunds/returns will be offered within the first 14 days in the following cases:
More than 5% of the paint peels off.
Controller stops working properly.
These conditions only apply to parts that experience these issues as a result of normal use. This does not cover dropping, water damage, or neglect. Since this is an amateur made bundle, what you see is what you get. No refunds or returns will be issued due to dislike of the painting feel, style, or flaws in the paint that are inherent in a project like this. 
All refurbished controllers are inspected and are guaranteed 100% playable. Do note that refurbished controllers, while extensively cleaned and tested, will have looser control sticks overall and may exhibit some wear. If you are looking for a controller for competitive play I recommend choosing the ""New"" option, which uses a brand new straight from the box Smash4 controller.
SHIPPING
Item will be shipped and should arrive 1-3 business days after finishing in the US.  International shipping is available but is going to be EXPENSIVE so please note this before ordering if you are outside the US. If the controller does not arrive within a reasonable time frame please feel free to contact me and I can help settle any shipping problems.        ",54.99,4.0,"Handmade item

            These balloon balls are made to look like a rugby ball but have the feel of a balloon ball. 
Just simply blow up your balloon inside the cover. Tie a knot and tuck the end inside. The  cover gives the balloon some weight you can easily bounce it, kick it, throw it and entertain your kids for hours! Use it for indoor and outdoor play. Great for trips away - simply deflate it and take a few balloons.
The balloon will be protected so if it pops all the broken pieces are kept safely inside the cover.
Each cover comes with 2 balloons.

            Sterling Silver Claddagh Ring, Men's Women's Claddagh Ring With Genuine Diamonds, Gemstone Crown Ring, Silver Symbolic Ring, Two Hands Heart
This sterling silver men's ring features 3 genuine diamonds at the center of a symbolic Claddagh: a token of loyalty, friendship and love. Atop the gemstone, three diamond accents sparkle. The hands represent friendship, the heart represents love and the crown represents loyalty. Depending on how the ring is worn, the meaning is altered. If worn on the right hand with the heart pointing inward, it means the person is spoken for, but if worn outward, it means the person is single. When worn on the left hand with the heart pointing inward, this tells others you've found true love.

How to Measure for a Wedding Garter:
1. Wrap a measuring tape around your thigh where you plan to wear your garters. Garters are typically worn about 4 inches above the knee. 
2. Look at the number where the measuring tape overlaps itself. This is the size of your thigh, which will guide you in knowing what size garter you'll need. Write it down if necessary. That's the number I need and I will adjust accordingly.
*The Lace is Elastic, therefore please do not add or remove inches from your exact measurement!*
This listing is for a Set of Garters including both Keep Garter & Toss Garter.
Keep Garter Material:
Lace Applique - 8x3 inches
Elastic Lace - 1,5 inches
Toss Garter Material:
Lace Applique - 6x2 inches
Elastic Lace - 1,3 inches
Color in the Photos: Cobalt Blue
You can pick whichever color you want upon checkout from 24 color options as shown in the 5th picture!

12842,Vintage Glass Cake Stand Classical Style,"
            Classically styled vintage glass cake stand.  Would look beautiful as part of a wedding dessert bar or holding the wedding cake itself! 
The stand is made from pressed glass with some flaws introduced during manufacturing including bubbles and lines, with fine scratches on the surface which can only be seen when held up to the light and closely inspected - not noticeable with a cake sitting on top! No cracks or chips.

Wikipedia:
The fig sign is a mildly obscene gesture used in Turkish and Slavic cultures and some other cultures that uses two fingers and a thumb. This gesture is most commonly used to deny a request.
Another use of this gesture is for warding off evil eye, jealousy, etc.[1]
In Ancient Rome, the fig sign, or mano fico, was made by the pater familias to ward off the evil spirits of the dead as a part of the Lemuria ritual.[2]
The hand gesture may have originated in ancient Hindu culture to depict the lingam and yoni.[1]
Among early Christians, it was known as the manus obscena, or ""obscene hand"".[1]
More anciently, it was the symbol of the fertility cult of The Goddess, Tanit or Ashtarte, and it was widely represented by painted or sculpted symbols in stone and portable amulets that were carried on the person, representing the powers of her hand, hand gesture used to invoke her. The oldest of these, made in ivory, are almost 8, 000 years old and must have symbolized former cults and forms of divinities alike the later known ones.
Recently, it has also become a common term in Padonkaffsky jargon to refer to Control-Alt-Delete. Svitlana Pyrkalo, a producer at the BBC World Ukrainian Service, explained that ""you need three fingers to press the buttons. So it's like telling somebody (a computer in this case) to get lost.""[3]
The letter ""T"" in the American manual alphabet is identical to this gesture.        ",1.50,5.0,"Handmade item

15428,Smalti Chips in a mix of Opaque Yellows--1 lb lot,"
            This is for a one pound (1 lb.) lot only. If you need larger quantities, please see the larger quantity listing for this same product. 
These tile chips, reclaimed from a recent renovation project, have any number of uses. 
* Add them to concrete as a colorful aggregate for counter tops or floors
* Use as a decorative mulch on plant pots
* Add to your art projects
* Since they are glass they are inert and could be used as decorative items in a fish bowl.
* Melt them in a glass kiln to create glass tiny glass globs (Note: not all colors melt well.)
The color mix contains 7 different yellows. The tiles these chips come from were manufactured in the 1950's by a factory in Murano, Italy. Most of the breakage that resulted in these chips occurred as the tiles were being removed from the wall they had occupied for 60 years. The chips are stable against further breakage. While not fully tumbled to create a smooth texture, there are very few sharp points on this material.
You may find some residual cement bedding on the chips, but I've worked hard to minimize this. If you feel any residual material would be an issue for your intended use, let me know and I'll make doubly sure to weed them all out.
One pound (1 lb) of smalti chips measures a little over one cup of material (measuring cup not included). I have quite a bit of this material so feel free to inquire about larger quantities. Shipping will be higher on larger quantities so additional charges may apply.
I can typically fit 2-3 lbs into one USPS small flat-rate box.        ",3.00,4.6667,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            **PLEASE READ BEFORE ORDERING!**
About:
Custom hand painted Grey Fade Nike Huarache by LGMSG.
Base shoe:
Please note that I purchase the shoes from a retailer before I customise the shoe by hand.In this case the base shoe is the Nike Huarache in the All White colourway. 
With this in mind you do not have to have the exact same design as the one shown in the pictures. You can change certain aspects of the custom to suit you. Whether this being the shade,colour or part of the shoe were the design is applied.
Turnaround Time:
The production of each pair of shoes in generally around 2-4 weeks depending on the complexity of the shoe. Once shipped, customers should receive their  product within 1-3 days for domestic orders.International orders can take from 6-12 days to receive product. 
Care for Shoes:
These custom shoe should be cared for properly.While the paint applied is very high quality and durable i do not recommend exposing them to extreme weather or participating in heavy duty action or sports if you plan on keeping them in good condition.Please note that any scraping, scratching as well as any other forms of neglect may result in permanent damage to the shoe.In terms of washing them,I would recommend investing in a shoe cleaning kit.I personally recommend the cleaning kit from Crep Protect. 
If you plan on using a washing machine, put it on a No heat wash!
 
Returns:
As each order is made to order in the preferred size, colour and design. All sales are final. If you are unsure on any information I have provided or unsure on the sizing of the product please get in contact with me so i can ensure you are ordering the correct size.

Upper- bovine leather. 
Lining- sheepskin. 
Rubber sole. 0.5 cm heel.

            The GHOOMAR JACKET:
These jackets have been inspired by the traditional Rajasthani dance called “Ghomaar”. Dancers twirl creating a kaleidoscopic effect with their dresses which is replicated in these jackets. The combination of the jacquard weave, jacobean and paisley designs are drawn from India’s rich heritage. This jacket is soft, comfortable, and hand-made. It is suitable for all occasions, and is warm enough to be worn in spring, autumn, and cool summer evenings. The wool is quite thick and the jacket fits loosely. 
----------------
How to wear the Ghoomar: 
----------------
♦ Wear your Ghoomar to the office- with a pencil skirt or a dress, or with a shirt and trousers, pair it with heels or boots, or even simple ballet flats.
♦ For an Evening out- Pair the Ghoomar with your favourite evening outfit, and take it to the next level with a chunky or elegant necklace. Throw on a colourful scarf if there is a nip in the air.
♦ During the day- Whether your personal style is more preppy or hipster, casual or formal, wear your Ghoomar and celebrate yourself.
