2044,"Vintage Chinese Porcelain Vase, Blue and White Porcelain Bottle Vase, Squat Form Vase, Chinese Republic Period Vase, Painted Vase","
            This listing is for a vintage Chinese porcelain vase. 
This blue and white porcelain vase is decorated with an image of a figure on a bridge.  The vase is a squat form, or bottle shape.
The vase's decoration is very nicely painted but one end of the design has been damaged in production.  The blue underglaze at the far left hand side of the design has been lost.  I've provided a photograph above.  
I believe the vase is of the Chinese republic period.
Apart from the fault to the blue decoration noted above, there are the following areas of damage to note:
*  There is a crack to the glaze at the rim of the vase (photograph provided).  The damage doesn't seem to extend through to the porcelain, it appears to be in the glaze only.
*  There are a number of pin holes on the outer surface of the glaze.
*  The rim at the base has a number of small chips.
The vase is 14cm tall (5.5 inches), and approximately 10cm across at its widest point (4 inches).
If you need any further information or photos, please do send me convo. I’m more than happy to answer questions or send further images        ",104.90,5.0,"Vintage item

2601,Maybe Later Deadstock 70's Peach Shirt With Shirt Party Print,"
            A tee dedicated for when you just don't feel like it. The second design in our personal t-shirt collection. 1970's deadstock peach colored 50/50 cotton poly t-shirt with baby sleeves and slight boat neck. The fit is so good on these babies. Featuring an original design by us in a groovy 70's font, reading ""Maybe Later.."", surrounded by stars we pulled from one of our favorite 70's hanging tapestries in bright white. Tee is meant to get better and better with washes, created a vintage look tee on an authentic deadstock vintage 70's t-shirt. Due to the nature of deadstock vintage, tees are limited to only M/L size stock, since thats what we found in bulk.

            Vintage 1980s men's western boots/cowboy boots in a sturdy shiny dark caramel brown leather by Frye.
These have pointed toes, stacked heels, and loops at the top to aid in pulling them on.
The tops of the feet are detailed with western inspired stitching, with more seam details around the ankles.
★Label: ""Frye Since 18??"" ""Made in USA...10...W""
★Condition: Very good - there is overall wear, most evident on the soles (see photo), and a little bit of white paint on the side of one sole (visible in photo).
★Measurements:
Length: 10 3/4""
Width: 4""
Heel: 2""
Total Height: 15""
I believe the ""10"" and the ""W"" stamped inside the boots refer to sizing but please use these measurements to determine whether this will fit. Comparing them to a similar shoe or boot is recommended.
