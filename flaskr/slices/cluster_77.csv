1086,Jade Ring,"
            Jade Ring
The Story & belief :
Thus jade is really special in Chinese culture, also as the Chinese saying goes ""Gold has a value; jade is invaluable.""
Because jade stands for beauty, grace and purity, it has been used in many Chinese idioms or phrases to denote beautiful things or people, such as Yu Jie Bing Qing (pure and noble), Ting Ting Yu Li (fair, slim and graceful) and Yu Nv (beautiful girl).
The size :
10 available for size 4 (US. Standard)
10 available for size 7 (US. Standard)
The shipping 
I'm using USPS priority mail for US orders, it takes up to 3-7 days from the moment of shipment. For international, it would take around 12-18 business days.
****The ring that you'll receive could be slightly different from the photo since jades are natural materials. Each ring has its own unique color :)
Thank you for visiting our shop & have a nice day!        ",4.99,4.7692,"Vintage item

1737,Vintage Telechron Clock Red Model 2H25 needs TLC,"
            I have a vintage red Telechron Electric Clock Model #2H25 from around the 1950's.  It measures about 7 1/2"" x 6 1/2"" x about 2 1/8"" in depth.  The cord is about 42"" in length.  The glass is a slightly ""foggy"" I believe on the inside with moderate paint chipping and also the left paint chips from previous chipping (both of these issue's could be cleaned if clock was taken apart).  The  left side and 2 bottom corners have some browning and a bit of spotting on the face.  The clock works but I was having problems setting the time as the hour/minute hands didn't seem to want to pass 12...... I would think this would be a minor adjustment.  I would consider this in guardedly good condition needing minor tlc.
I will ship internationally, please contact me with your country for a shipping quote.        ",41.50,4.9577,"Vintage item from the 1950s

            Macro photography, which makes the jewelry bigger than in reality,
read the dimensions carefully, thank you.
Beautiful German pin of the 1960's.
Souvenir of the German city ""Kitzbühel""
It is made of solid silver 800 and presents an old look: the money has been clouded by time, giving it more value and style.
The clasp works fine. Be careful, the end of the clasp is not in silver but in bronze.
Size : Ø 3 cm
There is a ""800"" silver stamp on the back, but it has been rendered quite illegible by small scratches.

4457,1960's VANITY CASE / Weekend Case / School Bag: In Dark Grey by Antler of Birmingham England,"
            A 1960's weekend bag in Dark Gray by Antler of Birmingham England; world renouned manufacturers of quality Suitcases, travel bags hand bags etc. 
( visit: www.antler.co.uk )
Whilst (adult) Ladies in the 1960's used this type of bag with a leather covered handle and leatherette covered sturdy sides, top and base as an overnight bag or bag for all their cosetics and pampering lotions and potions, I remember differently! 
A craze caught on, certainly in York England where I was born and educated. All the 'incrowd' High School (Secondary School) teenage girls used these exact same bags (and cheeper replicas) as school bags. There was plenty of room for pens, pencils, ruler, & eraser, gym kit & pumps (plimsoles), homework books, packed lunch, magazines, ingredients for the Domestic Science (cookery) lesson and a little illicit makeup and/or a few cigarettes and matches!!
This bag has all the indications of possible High School use with a pen (biro/bic mark on the inside lid, a few stains on the inside and what looks like cracking and a  repair to the leather at one end of the handle. The handle remains strong and usable despite its appearance in photograph 5!! 
Having given the minor negatives, the Vanity Case is in remakably good condition with:
* no splits, no tears or cuts, no unravelling stitching etc in the leatherette. 
* a lid that fits as it should and the hinges work as originally intended. 
* a locking mechanism that closes nicely and in a firm manner
* a key which seems to operate the lock (more often than not) ..... but
   which, I don't think, it is the original!
* an interior with all the elasticated 'garter' holders and concealed  
   pocke in place with no tears.
* an internal base still covered by the original protective, clear vinyl,
   wipe  clean, liner
This is a genuine Antler Weekend / Vanity Case with the Antler logo on the front and an Antler tag secreted inside the back storeage pocket. 
The Antler Vanity Cases also had, and this one has, off set handle fixing points and shot satin/silk interiors.
The case measures 
12.75"" wide (left to right)
9.5"" deep (Front to back)
7"" tall and
5.25"" to the top of the handle loop.

4515,Vintage SiLK NiSHiJiN ORi KINCHaKU - for 7-5-3-Ceremony - FREE SHiPPiNG!!!,"
            This is a vintage silk kinchaku. It would be a darling bag for a small one, a special bag for you to keep something in, or even great as display!
A kinchaku is a drawstring pouch which is carried when wearing a kimono to carry your necessities. This one is particular would be for a very young child for the ceremony which is called 'shichi-go-san' in Japanese. Literally means 7-5-3, and children whos ages are 7, 5 or 3 celebrate by going to temple, and they dress up, go to temple to get blessed.
Thus, the very shiny and fancy silk, which is a type of silk brocade called Nishijin Ori, from Kyoto. These brocades are reknowned for their fine patterns and use of gold and silver and other special threads. The Nishijin district has been hit especially hard after the Kobe earthquake of 1997, many of the small factories have had to shut down, and the industry is at a crisis.
So unfortunately, the beautiful brocades will eventually become harder and harder to find.
here's a Wikipedia page about Nishiujin Ori silks.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishijin
This Nishijin kinchaku is in great condition. It is from the sixties, central japan. A name has been penned into the lining silk, 'Kiku', and slightly bled thru the silk to the outside layer, but it is really hardly noticeable.
Will send in the regular airmail. Should be about 2 weeks.
FREE SHIPPING!!!!! It's included in the price.

            Choose ONE at this price.
These vintage handkerchiefs are lightweight, delicate, and easy to ship.  They come in all kinds or florals and simpler patterns (and solids). They make a lovely bridesmaid or shower party favor gift, for the mother of the bride gift, as your something blue, and are great in a handbag, a pocket, or down your bra! Tie it to the stem of your bouquet!
If you're not the bride, drop it when you see a cute guy walk by. Will he stop and pick it up? Only if he's old-fashioned and chivalrous.  Don't you want to find out? 
Floral prints are 1.00 more than the other selections since they are larger and ultimately more difficult to find. Leaf prints are 2.00 more. 
All come freshly ironed.  Single handkerchiefs come by first class mail.  
Once you buy eight or more, they come in a flat-rate priority envelope.
Buyers, do NOT put these little works of art into the washer or dryer. They are so delicate they will shred.  Unfortunately, I cannot replace them if you wash them in this way.  Hand wash with gentle soap that has been diluted in a basin of warm (but not hot) tap water and air dry, flat.  Take great care when ironing them, also. They can take a hot iron if you are very gentle about moving the iron around the handkerchief, and use absolutely NO steam.  I cannot be responsible for these once you launder them. They are 50 to 100 years old. They have been carried in ladies' pockets from the days of WWII to now.  Why would you throw them in a load with your bluejeans?  
Attention brides:  These are first quality handkerchiefs suitable as gifts. I have sifted through collections of handkerchiefs and have weeded out all the ones that are torn, stained, full of holes or otherwise no good. I cannot discount them for batch sales of 100 or more.  I have seen them sell here in California for 10.00 apiece. My prices are very competitive, so please don't ask about buying them for 1.00 apiece.  Occasionally I can put together a set of 100 with tiny flaws and sell them for 99.00. I call those listings Bride on a Budget.   Congratulations!        ",4.99,4.8219,"Vintage item from the 1950s

6477,Solid Organic Lanolin for woolie care - 2 ounces - wool care - soaker care - longies - shorties - wool wraps - wool covers,"
            This listing is for 2 ounces (57 g) of solid organic lanolin. The lanolin comes in a metal tin (yay for no plastic!). This is pharmaceutical grade, organic, pure lanolin. This 100% Lanolin is manufactured from the wool of free range sheep raised in Australia.
Lanolin can be used for a number of things, but here I will highlight its importance in wool diaper covers and the most green way of cloth diapering: wool. 
In order to perform to their highest potential, your wool cloth diaper covers and soakers will need to be lanolized. This should take place every 1-2 months, depending on how frequently you use your wool item, and if you're using them overnight or during the day. 
When your cover is retaining a urine odor, it is time to wash it. If you prefer to lanolize every time you wash, you can do so. I prefer to lanolize every few washings. 
First, wash the item in a lanolin-rich wool wash, I suggest my Relanolizer soap found here:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/129584225/lanolin-soap-for-wool-care-organic?
Then lanolize your cover.

8277,Organic Extra Strength Deodorant 1/3 oz Trial Size - Travel Size - Corn Starch and Zinc Free - Only Organic Essential Oils Used,"
            Now presenting my newest Edition.....Organic Extra Strength Deodorant! 
Made with all Organic Ingredients that help to eliminate odor causing bacteria with our own blend of Organic Essential Oils! It is Free of Corn Starch and instead we use Tapioca Starch! Corn starch contains natural sugars that feed odor causing bacteria. Using Tapioca Starch instead helps to keep you feeling dry just like Corn Starch, without accelerating the life of common under arm bacteria!
Most Natural Deodorants are made with a high concentration of Coconut Oil which does not stand up well to the Summer heat, or for traveling!  We have blended Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, which has its own properties, with Organic Unrefined Beeswax AND Organic Unrefined Cocoa Butter which helps harden it up! Unrefined ingredients contain all of the natural vitamins and enzymes that help your skin!
♦After becoming aware of the dangers of Anti-Perspirants, I started formulating my OWN Organic Deodorant! I used Anti-Perspirant up until about 5 years ago when I gave Organic Deodorant a try! I was wary as I did not want to go around smelling of ""Onion Rings"", BUT did not want to continue using the chemical & metal infused deodorant on the store shelves! 
It took a few days for my body to adjust to it, but soon my under arms became adjusted to it and I no longer had any lingering odor!
♦Facts About Anti-Perspirants and Why you should make the switch!
~Anti-Perspirants use micronized Aluminum that clogs your sweat glands preventing them from sweating.
~Aluminum DOES occur naturally in the world as a common mineral, BUT is not safe to have lodged in your pores!
~Your under arm area is also where some of your Lymph Nodes are located! They are very important for filtering impurities from your system. How can they filter your normal environmental toxins if they are bogged down with chemicals?
I recommend giving it at least a week of daily use to get your body accustomed to a chemical free deodorant. My testers have reported wonderful results!

I purchased the sample size of the extra-strength deodorant and I am in LOVE with it. I am definitely hooked for life and will be buying them as needed for as long as they are available! Thank you so much, and well done on making a natural deodorant that TRULY stands up - I ride horses and spend a lot of time being extremely physical on my feet and in the saddle and I have never had an underarm stick stand up so well, natural or otherwise. Plus, the smell is fantastic. I absolutely recommend, whole heartedly!! :) :)

This is an effective deodorant. I used it cycling 100 kms in our Aussie summer and, while it doesn't stop the sweat, it certainly helps the smell. It will melt in hot weather, but we are talking 39 degree days and that's all I was using.

Feedback from my product testers:
_________________________________
*One of my product testers who lives in Missouri where temperatures have been over 100 degrees has reported that it has stood up to sweltering heat keeping him from smelling after a day of sweating!
*Another product tester who naturally has a strong odor when working has reported that it stood up to a full day of hard work and dirtiness keeping him from smelling ""ripe"".
*I have been using this deodorant myself for 4 months now and have found it to last at least 24 hours!

8407,"Loki ~Tom Hiddleston ""Thor"" Upcycled Dictionary Art Print Poster","
            Hello! Welcome to my shop, I take unique vintage dictionaries from book stores all over the country and give them a new life and meaning. This design is printed directly onto a vintage dictionary page. The combination of the art mixed with the dictionary page looks awesome!
The page you get will be different from the one you see in the photo, but it will be from the same vintage dictionary. This uniqueness makes your print a truly ""one of a kind"" original. These pages have been carefully removed and measure approximately 8 x 11 inches (with slight variations due to removal). 
Your print will ""NOT"" come in a frame, but the picture shows you how your print will look if framed.
However, each art print will come in a protective clear sleeve for display.
These art prints make a wonderful gift or an instant conversation starter and plus, it's just really interesting to see the words and meanings that compliment your art print...you never know what definitions you are going to get!
Your one of a kind print will certainly be very intriguing and fun.

Product name: Sweet Almond Oil
Size: 4 fl.oz up to 112 fl.oz

Sweet almond oil is a favorite in aromatherapy as a carrier oil and is valued in natural skin care for it's ability to soften and condition the skin. Pale yellow in color, almond oil is expeller pressed from raw almond kernels. The oil contains glucosides, minerals and vitamins and is rich in protein. Almond oil is good for all skin types and helps to relieve dryness, itching and inflammation.

            Dual Camera Harness made out of a real leather. It really does not get any better than that.
This multicamera harness is suitable for new Nikon DSLR or Canon cameras, but can also be used with older 35mm Film Cameras- Your camera only needs to have screw hole in the bottom of the camera!
I have handmade this leather camera harness from start to finish- Every single step has been taken to ensure that the harness is highest of quality. The leather that I used is real full grain leather which means it will age really well and only get better with time and will last you a lifetime.
Here are some important aspects about the body harness:
Suitable for both male and female users
Adjustable size
Very strong metal hardware used
Comes with nylon safety straps that connects to the corner of the camera withouth causing rubbing marks.
Comes with additional straps for accessories or 3rd camera.
Very strong and durable real full grain leather with aniline finish- Lovely supple and soft feel.
This multicamera harness can be used with both SLR and DSLR cameras, as the bottom screw fits the universal tripod screw slot- As long as your camera has one, you can use it with this harness.
 
This product is handmade from start to finish and I take great care when making each one of them. If you have any questions about the product or have any special requests please don't hesitate to contact me!        ",132.66,4.913,"Handmade item

13444,"Burgundy wedding bouquet, Fall wedding bouquet, Sola wood bouquet, Alternative bouquet, Bridal bouquet, Rustic Fall bouquet, Wedding flowers","
            This beautiful handmade bouquet was intricately designed by me using natural colored sola flowers, hand dyed burgundy, navy,  and grey sola flowers, preserved babies breath and preserved dyed burgundy seeded eucalyptus.  The handle is wrapped in twine and finished with burgundy lace and pearl pins. The bouquet pictured is an extra large, the last photo shows the extra large bridal bouquet with a medium bridesmaid bouquet.
Colors can be customized/substituted. Please message me or add your color requests (up to 3 colors) in the notes section at checkout.
These all natural sola flowers are made out of wood from the tapioca plant and have a soft velvety feel, but are very durable. This bouquet will last a lifetime and makes a beautiful display piece that you can admire everyday!
This bouquet is available in 4 different sizes (measured in width from left to right side and height from top of bouquet to the bottom of the handle):
Small:       5"" wide 10"" long
Medium:  6"" wide  11"" long
Large:       7"" wide  12"" long
X Large:    8"" wide  13"" long
These measurements are meant to be an estimate for a size visual, but the bouquets will be at least what is described above. I make my bouquets very full with sola flowers and use a minimal amount of filler flowers (babies breath, german statice, yarrow). Because I make the bouquets so full, they may be up to an inch larger.
I suggest all brides get at least a large size bouquet. For more sizing information, click the link below to see pictures and descriptions,

PLEASE READ ABOUT SOLA FLOWERS:
Sola flowers are handmade (not by me) out of wood peels/shavings from the tapioca plant. They feel unique; they are soft, lightweight and durable. Because they are handmade from an all natural product, some flowers have dark spots, small holes or tears. These are not imperfections that have been caused by me, this is how the flowers are made.
Different colored flowers or accents may be added to the bouquet, just message me for any requests.  
I love to make matching boutonnieres, corsages, and bridesmaid bouquets for the rest of the wedding party, so please message me for these requests as well.
I look forward to helping you make your special day everything you dreamed of!        ",60.00,4.9324,"Handmade item

            Procion MX Dye, Turquoise, the most vivid of all dyes for cellulose (natural) fibers by Jacquard.  Cold water fiber dye
Use this dye for immersion dyeing, tie dye, batik, airbrushing, garment dyeing, screen printing, spatter painting gradation dyeing and more! Powder solution changes color when adding water. Final result matches bottle label. 
This cold water dyes does not require heat. This unique property sets Procion MX apart from all other dyes and establishes them as the undisputed king of backyard dyeing, batik and tie dye. 
Because Procion MX dyes can be used away from the stovetop, they are also perfect for shibori, ice dyeing, tub and low water immersion dyeing, printing, direct painting and other “alternative” dye applications.
 As a fiber reactive dye, Procion MX forms a strong covalent bond with cellulosic fibers, making it the most permanent and washfast of all dyestuffs. Examples of Fabric/Fiber
Ccellulose fibers: cotton, linen, canvas hemp, jute, ramie, sisal, paper, rayon and more. May also be used with protein fibers if acidified.
 Mix the concentrated dye powder with warm tap water to create the most vibrant of all colors for cotton, linen and other plant-based fabrics. Procion MX dyes are typically used with a soda ash fixative, which can be added directly to the dye bath or used to pre-treat the fabric, as in tie dyeing.
- Typically, one 2/3 oz/19 g bottle will dye more than 1 lb/0.45 kg of dry fabric. 
(Very bright colors will require more dye and pastel colors will require less.)
Available in a variety of colors, each sold separately. Conforms to ASTM D 4236. Made in USA.

            Scrap Leather Pieces - Mixed Colours - Scrap bag - 460 grams - 1 lb - 16 oz - remnants - off cuts
Offcuts of 100% genuine beautiful buttery soft leather in a mixed colour selection.
Although the images used in this listing are for illustration purposes ONLY, it does depict one of my 460g scrap packs! I will try to include as many different colour varieties as possible but please understand there may be colour repeats in there, it all depends on what's in my scrap drawer at the time! 
This leather varies in thickness from 1-2mm. Handy for all sorts of craft projects, jewellery making, bookbinding, purse making and leather craft. I can't take photos of each scrap bag as it takes so much time and I want to keep the costs down for you! If you'd like a specific colour, please let me know BEFORE purchasing so I can make sure I have what you need.
The pieces vary in size but are all a nice 'scrap' size, perfect for small to medium craft projects. Each piece measures approximately 3x3"" - 6x5"", sometimes larger, very rarely smaller. 
For a 230g pack of this bundle, try this listing: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/156897179
*Please note that as leather is a natural material, occasionally there will be peculiarities - this is not a flaw, but adds to the character of each piece. Some of these pieces may have tannery markings or similar on the reverse (suede side) such as stamping, cuts or labels. I will try to show this in the images where it affects the front 'smooth' side.
I have kept packaging to a minimum for shipping purposes so I can squeeze as much leather in package before the shipping goes up! Leather scraps will be sent loose, in a bubble mailer from the UK. 
Please read my shop policies before purchasing to find out about shipping dates and times and other important information. You can find these here:

This ribbon is so luscious with color. Sari's are torn into strips and knotted or stitched end to end. The ribbon has raw edges and the threads that linger come away very easily to make a smooth looking ribbon. 
You could find small imperfections here and there... a spot, blemish, tear, or flaw so just cut it out and either sew or tie back together.
Sari Silk is made in India and Nepal from recycled Sari dresses. It also comes from the mill ends or end of the run spools when manufacturing Indian Sari fabric for dresses. Sari Silk helps to empower the Indian women who work in the Recycled Sari Silk industry. 
Sari silk ribbon has so many uses: knitting, crocheting, quilting, weaving, jewelry, bangle bracelets, doll hair, flowers, paper crafting, wreaths, bows, garland, cording, art yarn, gift wrapping, scrap booking, tapestry, tassels, embellishment, fabric beads.

14754,Cross Stitch Patterns -- Wash Your Hands 5x7 (5 versions) and bonus Wash Your Hands patterned for bathroom towel (2 versions),"
            Cross stitch patterns ""Wash Your Hands"" 5x7 (in 5 different versions) and for bathroom towel or horizontal bookmark (in 2 versions). PDF digital download.
---The Story---
This is NOT a finished cross stitch. 
This listing is for a PDF pattern for several ""Wash Your Hands"" patterns depicting different common microbes. They are intermediate to advanced level patterns, but each can be finished easily in an afternoon.
By request, there are now several versions of the 5x7 ""Wash Your Hands"" pattern available (which will also fit on huck style hand towels with a 5x7 stitchable area), with the third microbe being switched out for several different options: the original ironic mad cow disease; cholera; black plague; C. Diff; and common cold, also shown in the longer horizontal towel pattern.
Any of the microbes shown in any of these patterns may also be stitched individually for a 3"" round embroidery hoop, though several of them are augmented from the originals for use in the ""Wash Your Hands"" pattern. 
---The Deets---
*WHAT YOU NEED: To complete these patterns, you will need knowledge of basic cross stitch, back-stitching, half stitches and filler stitches as well as French knots in some cases. The completed stitches were originally designed to fit on specific types of towels, but the first one (with E. Coli) can also fit in a 5x7 frame when stitched on regular 14 ct Aida cloth.
*WHAT YOU WILL GET: You will NOT receive a physical product. The patterns and images can be downloaded as soon as your payment has gone through, here on Etsy. Please let me know if you have any trouble opening or receiving the files!
The pattern includes a color legend for DMC embroidery floss.
*HOW YOU WILL GET IT: You will NOT receive a physical product. You will be able to download the files after payment has gone through. If you have any trouble, email or convo me and let me know!
If you would like a kit containing all the materials needed to complete the 5x7 ""Wash Your Hands"" in any of its several versions, it's up in the shop! See ""The Links"" below.

            Scrap Leather Pieces - Mixed Colours - Scrap bag - 230 grams - 1/2 lb - 8 oz - remnants - off cuts
Offcuts of 100% genuine beautiful buttery soft leather in a mixed colour selection.
Although the images used in this listing are for illustration purposes ONLY, it does depict one of my 230g scrap packs in the correct colour way! I will try to include as many different colour varieties as possible but please understand there may be colour repeats in there, it all depends on what's in my scrap drawer at the time! This leather varies in thickness from 1-2mm. Handy for all sorts of craft projects, jewellery making, bookbinding, purse making and leather craft. I can't take photos of each scrap bag as it takes so much time and I want to keep the costs down for you! If you'd like a specific colour, please let me know BEFORE purchasing so I can make sure I have what you need.
The pieces vary in size but are all a nice 'scrap' size, perfect for small to medium craft projects. Each piece measures approximately 3x3"" - 6x5"", sometimes larger, very rarely smaller. 
For a 460g pack of this bundle, try this listing: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/190662938
*Please note that as leather is a natural material, occasionally there will be peculiarities - this is not a flaw, but adds to the character of each piece. Some of these pieces may have tannery markings or similar on the reverse (suede side) such as stamping, cuts or labels. I will try to show this in the images where it affects the front 'smooth' side.
I have kept packaging to a minimum for shipping purposes so I can squeeze as much leather in package before the shipping goes up! Leather scraps will be sent in a zip-lock bag in a bubble mailer from the UK. 
Please read my shop policies before purchasing to find out about shipping dates and times and other important information. You can find these here:

Brand new Sajou Fil au Chinois ""Lin Cable"" Waxed Linen Thread #332 (0.77mm diameter). 31 colors. Made in France
♦ Thread is not on a spool. You will get winded to cardboard and placed to protective plastic bag thread. 
The #332 linen cable is the thickest thread in the range with a diameter of 0.77mm. Each spool contains 50 grams, about 133 meters of thread. These threads are twisted when damp, which avoids the linen fiber from being altered during twisting. Cabling or cording is a twisting of two already-twisted threads.
♦♦♦♦♦ About Fil au Chinois ""Lin Cable"" waxed linen thread: ♦♦♦♦♦
The Fil Au Chinois waxed “Lin Cable” is a luxury thread for high-quality leather work. As indicated in the name, this thread is cabled, signifying that the threads have been twisted a first time, and then these threads are assembled and twisted a second time. The term ""cable"", or corded, signifies this double twist. This obviously increases greatly the solidity of the thread, but also makes it more rounded, particularly adaptable for leather work. We have five thicknesses of linen cable: N°332 (0.77mm diameter), N°432 (0.63mm diameter), N°532 (0.57mm diameter), N°632 (0.51mm diameter), and N°832 (0.43mm diameter).
To order simply choose the color and quantity you want from the list.
♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦ SAJOU FIL AU CHINOIS ♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦
The name, fil au Chinois, dates back to a period in France when anything Oriental was fashionable. This interest for the Orient became very popular with the expedition to Egypt in 1798, by Bonaparte (the future Napoléon), Algeria’s conquest by France (1830) and twenty-five years later the opening up of China and Japan only reinforced this interest. The beginning of the brand Au Chinois was at the heart of this cultural movement. The idea was a success as it permitted the creation of a character easily identifiable and now legendary.
The brand, Fil Au Chinois was registered in 1847, by Francois-Philibert Vrau who founded his company in Lille twenty years beforehand. This was to protect an innovative method to present threads; spools surrounded with a label and placed in boxes.
But the brand Fil au Chinois really took off in the 1850’s with the arrival of Philibert Vrau, the director’s son. 
Then, like many other brands in Northern France, the Fil Au Chinois had a long period of decline mainly due to the first domestic sewing machines which were unsuitable for linen threads, industrial difficulties, inappropriate commercial policies...
While production numbers for the Fil Au Chinois didn’t stop decreasing, the interest for publicity objects and old products only increased for seasoned collectors. 
The Fil Au Chinois thread could have been in danger of disappearing had it not been for two, determined industrialists, Olivier and Bruno Toulemonde.In charge of Ets Toulemonde, one of the last remaining French thread manufacturers, the two brothers realized the importance of reviving and prolonging the history of Fil Au Chinois.
In 2007, Olivier and Bruno Toulemonde, determined to revive Fil Au Chinois and bring it back to its former glory, bought the branded product having overcome various difficulties amongst them putting machines back into working order, some dating back to 1890.
Frédérique Crestin-Billet, a passionate collector and herself at the heart of the Sajou brand revival, is part of this joint venture to restore the quality packaging that was once the hallmark of Fil Au Chinois.

20183,Girl's Birthday Iron-On Vinyl - Vinyl Glitter Iron-On - 5 Glitter Colors -  2nd Birthday Clothing - Birthday Shirt Iron-on - Second Birthday,"
            This listing is for an iron-on glitter vinyl heat transfer to use on clothing. It can be ironed/pressed on a shirt, onesie, romper, etc for the birthday girl to wear to her party! You save money and your little one looks cute as a button! They really look so cute in photos and make great photo props! We all know toddlers can't keep anything clean for more than 5 minutes anyways! It's completely machine washable as well.
Each iron-on heart is roughly 5 x 5 inches of sparkly glitter vinyl. Please select your color upon purchase and leave any special requisitions in the notes (i.e. you need it slightly smaller) It is so easy to put on and will come with wax paper and instructions (not that you really need them). Easy, peasy, lemon-squeezy! 
I can custom make these in any color, size, and style so convo me for a custom order. Thanks!
**Shirt is NOT included. It is pictured only as an example of size and application.**
