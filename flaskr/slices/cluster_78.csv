8274,Sensitive Skin Probiotic Deodorant - with Magnesium - Natural & Handcrafted,"
            New & Improved! Our popular deodorant formula just got even better - with Magnesium oil! Magnesium is a necessary mineral that many people, in our modern society, are deficient in. Magnesium not only plays an important role in our health and well-being, but it also is a powerful deodorizer. One of the best ways to absorb this mineral is through the skin so applying it with your daily deodorant is a win-win for everyone. 
Are you sick of commercial ""natural"" deodorants that just aren't doing their job and still have some questionable ingredients? 
Do you want something that not only works but is actually GOOD for you?
Probiotic Deodorants WORK - here's how: 
Probiotics are good bacteria that people usually ingest to help regulate their digestive health. Now, people are discovering that probiotics are also great at regulating the balance of bacteria on the skin. This good bacteria discourages the growth of unfriendly or harmful bacteria and yeasts such as Candida. Less bad bacteria under those arms means less odor to fight!
This listing is for 1 - 0.75oz twist-up tube of Emily's Homestead Sensitive Skin Probiotic Deodorant. For those with very sensitive skin, here's the original Probiotic Deodorant with the essential oils and baking soda omitted.  It does not need refrigeration and one tube usually lasts between 1-2 months. 
Ingredients: Beeswax, Shea Butter, Avocado Oil, Sunflower Oil, Arrowroot Powder, Shelf-stable probiotics (that include lactobacillus and bifidobacteria), Magnesium Oil, and Vitamin E oil.
Although this is unscented, it has a natural slight cocoa scent from the cocoa butter that is quite yummy!        ",4.00,4.9582,"Handmade item
