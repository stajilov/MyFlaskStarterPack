Properties of alpaca wool:
First of all, alpaca fleece has demonstrates perfect insulating properties, so is very useful in cold weather conditions, because protects the child's body with its warmth and also it's very adaptable to warmer conditions because it does not overheat the body. Alpaca wool is naturally breathable.
Alpaca wool is one of the most resistant and soft fibers, it does not cause allergies, it is lightweight and so comfortable that its special for hand knitting baby clothing like this cardigan.
We believe in the properties of natural fibers which are the most insulating, durable, soft, and eco-friendly materials on the market. That’s why we knit with alpaca wool for our own child’s.
Acurruca means hug with love and warmth and that’s what we love to do to with our creations
Enjoy!

- One as a shoulder bag would look great with a skirt suit and boots for a retro look!
- The other, strapless, as a clutch, perfect with a summer suit, or a cocktail. The leather straps is attached with two brass fittings on the underside of the flap.
The inside is made out of a light mink color leather and bears the Christian Dior/made in France logo in gold letters. There are scuffed marks where the zipper sat.
The bag is extremely flat. It comprises of a single pocket with a zippered pocket concealed under the flap.
The bag is in decent condition, considering the use. There are very light scuff marks on the leather that should go away with a little polish. There is a really puny for of red ink I suppose on the top left corner of the back of the bag. The brass on the monogramed clasp has rubbed of on the edges.
The dimensions are 11.5""W x 8""H . The bag is a little thicker than 3/4"".

4948,"Antique Dollhouse, Amsterdam Warehouse, Exact model of real Amsterdam Architecture made in 1905 Collectible Dollhouse","
            Collectible Museum Piece, handmade warehouse classic Amsterdam building from the 1700's, the dollhouse, a boy's playhouse, is made in Amsterdam too in 1905.
This piece was made by a man for his son in 1905, he made it exactly according to the original building of which he was the owner his name can be seen on the house I.J. Heijland. The original building has unfortunately been replaced in the  1900's by a bigger building. It was a tobacco ware house in Amsterdam. It was made of solid wood making it heavy and firm, it is in excellent condition, especially considering its age of 111 years!
This will be an amazing conversation starter when people see this in your home or office!
It has a total height of 29 1/2'' (75 cm), it is 20'' (51 cm) wide and 13 1/2'' (34 cm) deep.
This is a great collectible antique piece.  I've never seen one like this before, what a great find. 
Please look at the pictures, so many details hard to explain. 
Would be an amazing collector's piece, wonderful gift for an architect, Amsterdam lover or just to make your home a bit more special!
Damages: A lot of paint work is chipped but that only adds extra charm, I cleaned it up but it will need a more thorough cleaning inside and you might want to apply some protection spray to prevent further peeling of paint. You can see that it had a door on the back but it mus have been removed soon afterwards as it clearly has not been there for many years. No repairs or alterations.
     Two shipping options:
     Registered mail by ground can take 15 uptil 40 days, is cheaper and safe but slow.
     TNT which takes 5-7 days to arrive. PLEASE LEAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER DURING CHECKOUT if you want this option. TNT is fast and is trackable online.

7584,"Certified Organic Essential Oils Starter Kit - 6 oils - Lavender, Peppermint, Lemongrass,  Tea Tree, Eucalyptus, Sweet Orange","
            When your first getting into aromatherapy its hard to know what oils to start with. This kit is designed for new users and covers all the basics. Its also serves as a unique gift for people wanting to share aromatherapy with people they care for. ArOmis essential oils are certified organic in Holland and have an amazing rich aroma because they are grown in the rich volcanic soils of Africa.  If you check around on the internet you will find that our prices for Certified Organic Essential Oils are competitive with non-certified oils at about half the cost that certified oils are normally priced at retail. Our essential oils are made in South Africa by a very established grower who normally only supplies the sophisticated European market. We are very lucky to have access to this quality of oil at such a great price. 
We have a mission of sustainability that is fully expressed in our small agroforestry farmer produced essential oils.  In the spirit of fair trade and environmental stewardship, using African oils grown in tropical and sub tropical areas encourages local farmers to use less land more wisely and to preserve the indigenous forests by growing high value crops in harmony with the surrounding forests replacing corn and other destructive fertilizer and slash and burn agricultural crops.
Some information about the oil selection in the kit. There are a range effects that particular essential oils cause. These include, relaxation, stimulation, cleansing of exterior, and cleansing of interior that are covered by the oils that are included. They all also have different emotional effects.

Why you should by our log cake stands vs someone elses:
1. Ours our thicker than most and less likely to break. Thin slices are prone to breaking and cracking because they are cut across the grain. Plus our thicker slices just look better. We've had lots of customers come to us after their skinny slices have broken placing rush orders and expedited shipping.
2. We remove the bark, while many people like the look of the slices with bark they see on Pinterest etc..., hate to break this to you, but that is where many bugs live, in the bark and under the bark, spiders, beetles, all sorts of creepy crawlies. Plus the bark often just falls off or flakes off. We've had lots of customers come to us after their bark has fallen off placing rush orders and expedited shipping.
3. Our wood is dry, it's standing dead for many years, drying in the arid, low humidity, Colorado Rockies. It is not prone to mold or mildew as many woods are from wetter areas of the country.
4. Our wood is beautiful, and it goes very well with wedding cakes.
We suggest that you order a stand that is a bare minimum of 2"" larger than your cakes diameter, which equates to a margin of just 1"" all the way around. So if your cake is 12"" you'll want to order a stand in the 14"" - 15"" range, or larger (with emphasis on the or larger). If your cake is 13"", and you order a 14"" - 15"", you''ll be cutting it very close, with as little as 1/2"" of margin. The size ranges mean that we're going to send you one somewhere in that range, we're not going to break down the sizes any finer than that, as these are trees and they vary a lot in shape and have wavy edges. Not trying to upsell, but check out our shop updates for some pictures that have been sent to us by customers who have ordered larger than needed and decorated on and around the stand. You can do some pretty creative things with a few inches of margin all the way around.
Also, keep in mind that the cake size you get from your baker might be the size of the cake pan, before frosting and decorations. And if your baker knows ahead of time what you're planning to put your cake on, they might want to coordinate and utilize the margin creatively. So talk to your baker, you might want to get them the stand while your planning your cake.
Also FYI, we get this question a fair bit, why is a 15"" stand twice as much as a 10"" stand? As the math works out the 15"" stand is roughly twice the surface area, therefore, twice the wood, twice the work, twice the finish, it's like making two tens.
This is a log, a piece of an unprocessed natural tree, it has cracks, checks, knots, branches broken off, pieces splintered off, saw and tool marks from the harvesting process, and coloration and shapes will vary drastically from one tree to the next. If you are not okay with these natural variations then this product will not be right for you and we ask that you please refrain from ordering this. Please do read our shop policies, they are written to inform customers that might not be familiar with a natural product such as this as these variations might not be readily apparent from pictures in design magazines.
## Discount pricing available on purchase of ten or more, ask. ##

8418,Mason Jar Flower String Art,"
            Mason jar flower string art with artificial flowers! The size of the wood measures approximately 10"" x 5"", and the height of the flowers will vary from 1-5 inches above the wood.
Please include in the ""Note to Seller"":
-String color of the mason jar (the most common are Aqua and Linen)
PRODUCT MAY VARY SLIGHTLY DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY OF FLOWERS! :) The artificial flowers I specifically use are sold seasonally, so I apologize if the type of flower you'd like is out of stock. 
I try to make each piece consistent, so you know what you're getting. However, due to the handmade nature of my items, no piece will be the exact same as the last. The character of wood always differs, showing a different grain or knots in different places. This being said, each piece of wood takes to wood stain differently than the last, making for a slightly different color every time (for example, stain always darkens on and around a knot). Each piece is backed with a saw-tooth hanger, so you're able to hang it with ease. 
Please see the pictures for examples of string and stain colors!
***If further customization is wanted (i.e. different color(s), different size, etc.), please send me a custom request message prior to purchasing! :)***
Please allow for slight differences in color due to monitor setting.        ",40.00,4.9855,"Handmade item

9198,Plier Spinning Top -Copper EDC Spinning FifthPocket Top,"
            This is the second version of my FifthPocket Top and is hand turned from 1.5"" tellurium copper and fitted with a 1/4"" silicon nitride bearing.  
I designed this top to fit nicely in the fifth pocket and provide an entertaining addition to my everyday carry.  The polished top surface makes the top an excellent worry stone.  A simple and surprisingly multi-functional item.  Since each top is made by hand the top you receive will look very close to, but not exactly like, the top pictured.
I test each top to insure that it will spin smooth to the 5 minute mark.  
This top takes a bit more practice to spin than my other tops but after some time playing, it easily spins more than 5 minutes (my spins are typically around 10 minutes on a concave surface).  I initially spun this top with my thumb and middle finger from opposite hands, but after some practice I began to spin with my thumb and middle finger from the same hand (and got longer spins from it).

11754,"Wedding Tradition Pin-Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue-Gift for the Bride, Swarovski Crystal Heart & Pearls","
            Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blue. This tradition comes from an Old English rhyme about the four objects that a bride adds to her wedding outfit or carries with her on the big day as good luck charms. They are little tokens of love that a mother,  sister, and/or maid honor will give the bride (or you can give them to yourself, too). Something old represents continuity; something new offers optimism for the future; something borrowed symbolizes borrowed happiness; something blue stands for purity, love, and fidelity. 
This pin can be attached to the inside of the bride's wedding gown, garter, or on her flower bouquet so she can carry the good luck charms with her on the wedding day. After the big day, the bride can choose to remove some or all of the charms the from the pin and wear them on the included Sterling silver chain as an everyday reminder of one of the most memorable and important days of her life.
What you get on your Wedding Tradition Pin:
1-Silver Plated Kilt Pin with 4 loops and lobster clasps
1-Cleaned & Polished Penny 25 years or older (something old)
1- Wire wrapped (24-Gauge) Sterling Silver Plated Peas in a Pod pendant that features two, white Swarovski crystal pearls representing the bride and groom (something new)
1-Silver-plated Stainless Steel place holder heart charm for the bride to take off and attach the 'something borrowed' (a small piece of jewelry or a special token from someone else that will be returned after the wedding)
1-Blue Swarovski crystal heart pendant (something blue)
1-24"" Sterling Silver Rolo chain with a lobster clasp closure
*Each pin will be packaged in a sheer white gift pouch for you to present to the bride
I make all of my wedding pins by hand so please let me know if you have a customization request ahead of time and I will return your message in a timely matter so that we can design the perfect pin for your bride.
Upon purchase, you agree to the processing time (1-2 days) and have read my shipping policy. If you need this pin in a hurry, I can ship your order via USPS Priority Mail (2-3 day estimated delivery) or USPS Priority Express Mail which are both available at checkout. Once your order has shipped, you agree to track your order at USPS.com with the tracking number you will receive in an email upon (from Etsy). If you need to contact the USPS regarding delivery of your order, you may call them at 1-800-275-8777 or visit usps.com

11799,Wedding Guest Book horizontal landscape guestbook sign in book photo booth hardcover personalized names wedding planner book rustic kraft,"
            This wedding guest book in a horizontal, landscape format can be personalized with your names on the cover in rustic kraft or classic black and white, or a custom cover or font color (inquire for details). Your new ""Mr. and Mrs."" is highlighted on the spine, or any 5-6 words of custom text you prefer. Our hardcover guestbook comes with your choice of blank, lined, or black pages. A ribbon marker in your choice of 10 colors marks your place. Use blank or lined pages for a true sign in book to log memories of the Big Day from your family and friends, or use the black pages for an instant photo book or photo booth book and have guests include a photo of themselves. This personalized wedding book can also be used as a beautiful wedding album for photos and memories of your wedding day, scrapbook style.
Horizontal/Landscape Guest Books are made with casebound, hardcover construction and finished with a matte laminate for protection and longevity. They come in two sizes; our larger, 10.5x8.25 inch version is photographed here with a pen for scale.
Please note that the kraft color is a printed effect, and the book is not bound in kraft paper. Our rustic white color is a shabby chic off white with natural variegation and the appearance of a slight texture. It is not a stark, bright white. We're happy to share more photos upon request. Covers can also be customized to navy, blush pink, or any of the 40 colors on our color chart.
When ordering, please enter your personalization details at checkout:

---------------------------- ♥ ♥ ♥ ----------------------------
♥ TURNAROUND TIMES: Once your proof is approved, your order begins its production process which individually prints and binds your guest book to order, one at a time. So that your order can be printed and finished professionally, please allow 6-7 business days after your proof is approved for completion by our talented production team. Thereafter, your order will ship and transit time is determined by the shipping carrier and speed you select at checkout. Please note that business days do not include weekends, so keep these timelines in mind when ordering for your wedding day. Total time from approval to the book in your hands may extend to about two weeks. Expedited shipping is available at checkout with 2-Day and overnight options, but this does not affect the 6-7 business day production time and only affects the speed your order travels AFTER it is made to order. Please let us know your absolute need-by date in the ""notes to seller"" along with your customization so that we can best serve you. We can help with recommendations for shipping speed.
♥ RUSH OPTIONS: Rush options are limited to specific size and page types, and we may not be able to accommodate every rush request. Rush orders incur additional charges for production and shipping. Please contact us *prior* to ordering to be sure we can accommodate your rush request and we will discuss options with you.
♥ PROOFS: Proofs of all personalized items, including guest books and journals, are delivered to your Etsy inbox via the Conversations feature, usually within 1-2 business days of your order. We require your proof to be approved on time to keep your order moving toward production and shipment, so please be sure to stay on top of your Etsy convos. If you have Etsy notifications to your email turned off, please remember to check back in via your browser or app to check for your proof delivery. We'll attempt to reach you twice by Convo and once by email to obtain approval before going to production as is after 7 days. If proof approval is delayed, it will mean your shipment date will be delayed or rescheduled, so please plan to be in contact with us after purchase for the proofing phase.
♥ INTERNATIONAL BUYERS: Standard Shipping is via economy service with a average travel time of about 2-4 weeks after production (most destinations are about 2 weeks). This transit time is not guaranteed. This shipping service is not always 100% trackable, especially once it reaches your country. Please take this into account when ordering. If your event is less than 6 weeks away we recommend upgrading your shipping service. Expedited International shipping with full tracking and insurance is available as a shipping upgrade at checkout and travel time is about 6-10 days. If you require accurate tracking and expediting of your shipment, you must upgrade your shipping choice.

            **If you would like to see what your names would look like in a certain font, feel free to send me a message and I can send you a mock-up! Please note that I size all names to each other, meaning if your longest name is Samantha, then her name will be the max of 4"" long and all other names will be sized to hers to make your glasses look as uniform as possible. Long titles like Mother of the Bride, Mother of the Groom, etc. will be split into 2 lines. Maid/Matron of Honor will be on one line. If you'd like both a name AND title, please see my other listings!** 
Like the look of the glasses in the first listing picture? Choose Metallic Gold and font 8!
This listing is for a set of five (5) 8.5 oz. (approximately 5.75"" tall) personalized, stemless champagne flute glasses! These make a perfect gift for the whole wedding party, for your favorite girlfriends or baby shower hostess gifts! Perfect for bachelorette parties, bridal showers, or sipping cocktails while getting ready for your big day! These wine glasses are a must-have for your ""Will you be my bridesmaid?"" box!
**Don't forget a glass for yourself!**
Decals are made with a high quality, premium permanent adhesive vinyl to ensure durability. With this said, it is best to keep these glasses out of the dishwasher - I advise everyone to hand wash only!
Etched Silver or Gold look great on these, but feel free to customize in any colors(s) you desire!
Ordering is easy!
1. Choose desired vinyl color (see pictures 2 and 3) from the 'Color' drop-down list! If you would like different colors for each glass, just add this to the Notes to Seller' section at checkout. Be specific as possible here please!

            Soft Copper Soldering Paste 1/2 oz Syringe, Eurotool Soldering Tools and Supplies
Shipping includes Tracking and Insurance 
Although copper solder paste is not actually copper in color, it is less bright than silver solder paste and is also cadmium free. Flow point is 1325°F(718°C), melting point 1240°F(671°C). 1/2 ozt.  
HOW TO USE IT:
When soldering, make sure your metal is clean and dry. The heat is applied to the metal, not the solder itself. So all you do is put the soldering paste on the joint and heat the metal you're soldering, when the metal gets hot enough the solder will flow into the joint and seal it. When finished, dip it in the pickle solution if you have any discoloration or fire scale [this happens if the flame is really hot]. Remove from the pickle with fingers or copper tongs to avoid accidental contamination. I just use a small amount of warmed pickle for one type of metal and toss it when I'm finished soldering.
You can use a butane torch, soldering iron, alcohol lamp or even one of those butane lighters to heat the metal to get it hot enough for the solder to flow.
Contains Fluorides - use with adequate ventilation.
Note - Soldering doesn't 'fill holes' or empty spaces. For best results / stronger soldered joints, just make sure both sides of the metal you're joining fit flush before adding the paste :)

---------------------------------
MATERIALS
GOLD-FILLED JEWELRY:
- Under normal wearing conditions and with proper care, your gold filled jewelry should last at least 10 years.
- 14kt Gold-Filled jewelry is made by bonding a solid layer of 14kt gold on top of another metal, but this layer is 1000 - 10,000 times thicker than gold plating, resulting in a durable, long-lasting product that looks gorgeous like solid gold.
- Gold-Filled jewelry can also be worn by people with sensitive skin.
STERLING SILVER:
- We use .925 Sterling Silver, which requires polishing from time to time from oxidation. You can easily restore silver back to shine with a polishing cloth or use a polishing lotion for that extra shine.

            ***Due to high volume of orders...production time is currently 4-7 DAYS!!
• DETAILS •
Get in the spirit with this ""Roll Tide"" University of Alabama necklace. The Roll Tide is a handcut brass or sterling silver pendant that is polished and sealed OR 14k gold plated and polished and sealed. The chain is a 14k gold filled sturdy chain or sterling silver chain (anti tarnish and allergy free)!
****Please choose necklace length and material - Brass or Gold Plated (GP) or Sterling Silver
Seen in picture with a 16 inch chain
****If you are not sure on the length of chain, please choose the shorter length you would like and then the ""2 inches."" If you chose a 16 inch necklace  2 extender inches (gold filled), it would give you the option of a 16 to 18 inch necklace! If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask!
• HOW IT'S MADE •
This is a handmade brass or sterling silver pendant polished and sealed OR plated with 14k gold and polished and sealed. The chain is a dainty 14k gold-filled chain (nickel free and anti-allergy) or a delicate sterling silver chain. I handsaw the letters out of brass or sterling silver sheet metal and then sand and polish the pendant. If you choose, it then goes through an electroplating process that bonds 14k gold to the brass pendant (all done by me in my studio). I finish up the piece by attaching it to a 14k gold-filled or sterling silver chain (anti-tarnish and allergy free).
If you choose brass as the material, it can tarnish over time (even though it is coated with renaissance wax). When that happens simply run the brass pendant portion under warm water and lightly scrub with a mild soap and soft toothbrush. Dry immediately when complete. Or see the following site: http://jewelrymakingjournal.com/how-to-clean-brass/
Gold plating is a method of depositing a thin layer of gold onto the surface of another metal by chemical or electrochemical plating.
Each necklace is handmade so please allow for variations

CRYSTAL MEANINGS LORE OF AMETHYST
Keywords:  Psychic, Sobriety
Amethyst is a meditative and calming stone which works in the emotional, spiritual, and physical planes to promote calm, balance, and peace. It is also used to eliminate impatience.
Amethyst is used as beneficial when dealing with legal problems and money issues, which can lead to prosperity and abundance, though it is not the best known prosperity stone.
In the psychic and spiritual realms, amethyst is an excellent all-purpose stone that can increase spirituality and enhance intuition and psychic powers of all kinds. It does this by making a clear connection between the earth plane and other planes and worlds. Amethyst is also excellent for meditation and lucid dreaming. It is used to open one's channels to telepathy, past life regression, clairaudience, clairvoyance, and communication with angels. Amethyst also protects against psychic attacks, especially during spiritual work.
Amethyst is not only a psychic protection stone, but is also used to protect one from thieves, and to protects travelers. 
Emotionally, amethyst is used in crystal healing  to help heal personal losses and grief, bringing one gently past. Amethyst has a gently sedative energy that ca promote peacefulness, happiness, and contentment. It also is said to bring emotional stability and inner strength. This stability and strength not only helps one hold firm in one's life, but it can enhance flexibility and cooperation. To be flexible at need is a sure sign of strength.
Amethyst is very well known -- as from the ancients -- as a sobriety stone. It has been used for millenia to prevent drunkenness, and is used to assist in getting rid of addictions to alcohol, drugs, smoking, etc, and destructive compulsive behaviors of all kinds.

            Handmade personalized charm clay necklace with initial of your choice. Necklace comes on a raw brass colored chain, and the chain measures 30 inches. Initial charm is 2 inches long. Pendants have a matte finish.
We make every single pendant by hand using oven hardening clay. 
--------PROCESS-------
This necklace is hand stamped. The letters are aligned by eye and stamped individually by hand. This is not an exact process, so letter depth will vary between pieces and letter alignment may not be perfect. For me, and the people who buy my products, this inexactness is part of what lends originality to my work, as opposed to the cookie-cutter feel of machine made pieces.
In addition, colors vary depending on the device the photos are viewed on. This means that the product you actually receive may not perfectly match the color shown on your screen.
Shipping time is approximately 1- 2 weeks.
**** Letters are more subtle on COPPER pendants*******

This sexy body chain is a shiny chrome and feels so nice on.  The collar is three chains soldered together with a D ring in front, double chain running down to an O ring just above the navel and a chain circling around to a tiny lock in back. 
Sorry the photos are a bit dark. The chain is chrome (sliver color) shone better in the 1st & 3rd photo.
Collar is adjustable from 13"" to 17"", please choose waist size.  *If you don't see the size just contact me.*
Comes with two keys and an elegant keepsake pouch.
The lock is cute and dainty and is not expected to hold up to rough play.  You can upgrade to a little stronger lock.  The 5th photo shows little sliver lock & upgraded brass lock, both come two keys.
This item is made from either steel or iron electroplated chrome chain. It is non-corrosive and nickel free.  The only part that may contain nickel is the tiny silver lock and the clasp.  I am in the process of finding nickel free clasps.
