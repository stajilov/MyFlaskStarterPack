148,Cedric ~ Vintage 1930's Chiltern Teddy Bear,"
            Dear Cedric is a lovely bear that was made by Chiltern Toys in England in the 1930's. 
Cedric is made from lovely golden silky mohair and is a five jointed bear with swivel head, arms and legs. He has lovely amber glass eyes, the characteristic 'hook' stitched Chiltern bear nose and mouth, stitched claws on his arms. The pads have been replaced with leather at some time. There is some slight stuffing loss to the tops of his arms. His head is stuffed with wood wool and his body with kapok filling. Cedric measures 19"" tall.
Cedric has been well loved over the years and obviously cuddled a lot as he has quite extensive balding to his fur but still retains remnants of his golden mohair fur all over his body. Some loss of stuffing to his upper arms.
This bear will be posted by Royal Mail UK 1st class post and need to be signed for.Proof of postage will be provided.
I always use recycled materials for posting and all parcels are well packaged and clearly addressed.        ",53.06,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1930s

1740,Antique mantle Clock housing Case pressed wood Parlor clock Gingerbread shelf clock Shrine display box,"
            This wonderful old empty pressed wood clock case came from the 
estate of a gentleman known as ""Grandpa Clock"" by his family, 
friends, and patrons.
It measures 22"" tall by 14"" wide and 4"" deep.
Condition:
The glass in the door has the remains of an ornate decal affixed to it 
and a masking tape sticker with the number 12 written on it. If either
of those elements are not to your liking I'm thinking they could be 
taken off with a razor blade and a little patience. 
Note that the back board has a split in it that could be held back together
with some wood glue (see photo No. 5). The case could be left as is 
OR the wood might benefit from a good cleaning and some oil or polish.
Inside the case remains a portion of the metal bell/chime. It is held on 
with a screw and can be easily removed if you prefer it gone.
This old case has a delightful presence about it and would make a lovely
shrine or display box. Adding some small shelves to its interior would be 
another way to up-cycle its appeal and appreciate the utility it offers.
Please study the photos to assess its condition and value.

About the designer:
Giorgio di Sant' Angelo, 1933-1989 (also known as Giorgio Sant'Angelo), was an Italian fashion designer. He opened his ready-to-wear business in 1966. Ms. Vreeland recognized the talent of Sant'Angelo, and hired him as a freelance stylist. It was out of this collaboration that some of the most iconic fashion photographs of the 1960s were taken. Shots like the model Verushka wrapped in fur in the desert, or psychedelic flower makeup around one of Twiggy's eyes.
His legend continues in the minds of modern-day fashionistas, with designers like John Galliano & Marc Jacobs citing him as an influence. He was given a plaque on the '7th Avenue walk of fame' along with his contemporaries like Halston and Stephen Burrows. (wikipedia)

2536,Vintage Teal and Hot Pink Striped Sweater Vest,"
            Slim, striped sweater vest. It's lightweight and perfect for summer, though it feels like it has a bit of wool in it, so you might want to wear a tank underneath! It would also look great with a collared shirt under in the fall! Very slight boat neck.
No size marked, but I would estimate it's between a small an medium.

3187,Vintage unused Sew-Ette hand-held sewing machine stitcher,"
            Greetings from Down Under!
I have a vintage Sew-Ette portable hand stitcher/sewing machine in original box by the Ideal Company, made in Japan in the 1950s.
The box fits very closely around the hand stitcher, so the box measurements are a good indicator of the actual item: 
13.5cm length
8cm height
5.5cm depth
Comes with the replacement needle sachet, a needle threader and instructions in good (but vintage) condition. 
The spool of thread that comes with the hand stitcher is intact and appears unused.
Great collectors display item for the avid seamstress, quilter or crafter.
See photos as they form part of the description.
While I only list 5 countries in the shipping section, I do ship to other countries too. Please contact me for shipping costs to your area/country. Feel free to ask any other questions regarding the item. Shipping can be combined and worked out on an individual basis.

3623,"Vintage Rugged Melton Wool Pants from Wintermaster. Men’s Vintage 1960s, 1970s Winter Slacks. Seriously Thick and Warm. Deadstock. 36 x 31","
            Men’s vintage Melton wool pants feature a flat front, tapered leg and waist band has belt loops and exterior suspender buttons. There are two side pockets and two back pockets. Closure is hook and bar with a metal YKK zipper. 
This rugged fabric is a wonderfully thick Melton wool in taupe with light blue flecks throughout. 
If you're not familiar with Melton wool here's some great information from the Vintage Fashion Guild:  “Melton looks much like thick felt with its twill weave…obscured by fulling and shearing of its nap... The dense, thick construction makes it wind and rain resistant and extremely warm. Melton takes its name from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, UK, where it was first woven and used to make jackets for fox hunting (in red)”…  Later in black for the donkey jacket an iconic symbol of the working class laboring man. Both uses rely on its weatherproof qualities.
Era:  In researching these pants I found only one Melton Wool Wintermaster ad, which was from 1969.  With this and pant details,  I believe they are late 60s into the 1970s.

            An incredible ball gown here! It is absolutely stunning and let me say this now - it is in flawless condition! There is no label.

The front of the dress is shorter by four inches with the back having a bit of a train.The jacket is adorable too. It's a timeless ball gown from the 1980s that could have been worn many more decades ago, but can certainly be worn today!

5938,Vintage Japanese Handkerchief/ Mid-Century Handkerchief/ Japanese Woman and Children/ Traditional Japanese Dress/ Collectible Handkerchief,"
            This listing is for a beautiful vintage Japanese handkerchief from circa 1960.  It depicts a woman with two young girls, possibly a mother and daughters, in traditional Japanese kimono.  The artwork on the handkerchief is quite detailed and rather delicate.  This would be a great addition for any collection, or could be framed for a really pretty and interesting display piece.
As there is some age to this item, it has taken on a cream colored tinge over the years.  There are also a few minor stains that are very light, but could be easily removed by someone who knows how to clean vintage cotton.  The two left-hand corners have small holes, most likely from a hanging price tag.  
*****Please remember that these are vintage items and may or will show signs of age or wear. I try to make sure my descriptions are clear. Please really look at the photographs, enlarge and read the descriptions including sizes and condition so you understand what you are purchasing. Please ask before purchasing if you have any questions. Everything is packed well as I want your items to arrive safe and sound.

At this time we cannot sell these pieces separately. 

This rustic, modern Little Chef Stool is the perfect height to be used with your kiddos in the kitchen! Your children will appreciate the added independence and your arms will finally get a break from all the extra lifting to the sink and counters. The unique railing allows children to climb in and out of the stool without assistance, while still providing extra security. You have the ability to remove the dowel rod and railing as your child outgrows the need for it. 
    This stool is intended for young toddlers who are just learning how to stand/walk, i.e. those who do not have the coordination to safely stand on a stool unassisted.
Choose from a variety of paint and stain options! Have a different color in mind? Choose any Valspar paint for your tower, just send us the paint name/number.

6731,"Vinyl Monogram Decal, Yeti Cup Decal, Tumbler Monogram Decal, Car Monogram Decal, Bow Monogram, Monogram Sticker, Circle Monogram","
            This listing is for one monogram decal. These decals are perfect to place on a tumbler, agenda, and even your car! 
In the notes to seller section at checkout, please provide the initials EXACTLY how you would like them to appear, as well as the monogram style you would like (Bow, Vine,Circle, Scalloped Circle, or Fish Tail). Please note that the Vine style monogram cannot be done in the 1"" size. Traditional monograms are placed with the last initial in the middle.
****It is recommended that you apply your decal as soon as possible upon receiving it. The longer it sits on the transfer paper, the harder it will be to apply. Vinyl works best when applied on a smooth hard surface. Any surface with any kind of texture will not apply well.****
How To Apply Your Decal:
Step 1
Clean and dry the area thoroughly with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Do not use Windex or similar products because it will leave a residue behind that will prevent the decal from adhering well. ***Please note that if you are applying your decal to a Yeti style cup, even the slightest of finger prints on the application area may cause difficulty when applying
Step 2
Prepare the decal for application by firmly rubbing a credit card, or something similar, across the clear transfer paper. This removes any air bubbles that may have formed and makes the decal cling to the transfer paper.
Step 3
Peel the white paper backing off the sticker. If the decal clings to the backing, slowly replace the paper backing and repeat Step 2.
Step 4
Slowly lower the decal onto the surface and rub it in place firmly with a credit card.
Step 5
Slowly peel the clear transfer paper off at a sharp angle. Be careful not to pull the decal off of the surface. If the decal does pull away from the surface repeat Step 4. If you are still having difficulty, you may also use your fingernail to separate the decal from the clear transfer paper and push the decal onto the surface while pulling the clear transfer paper away at the same time. 
*If any air bubbles are seen through your decal after application, you may use a pin or sewing needle to poke a small hole in the center of the bubble to push the air out.*

Rustic American Flag
Barn wood flag
This rustic American flag is a premium handcrafted item. Several hours of work, with great attention to detail, go into making each wood flag. This rustic American flag is a conversation piece and is a stunning display of American heritage for your home. 
Proudly display your patriotism with this rustic American Flag! My wood American flags are all made from 100% old salvaged wood, hand painted and distressed to give them a worn, weathered appearance. My flags are made from old Texas barns, homesteads, and fencing. This wood is visibly old and full of character.  
The wood flag will make a wonderful addition to any room in your home or business!  Nail holes, splatters and tatters are visible on the front of the flag. The imperfections of the old wood make this a beautiful piece. 
I proudly hand paint our nations red white and blue onto the old wood. Each of the thirteen stripes are carefully measured and hand painted.  My flags are painted the original way - with a brush - and not sprayed. The flag is perfectly proportion. Each of the fifty white stars are hand painted. Once the flag is painted, I stain then distress the paint so the paint matches the character of the old wood.
My flag is rear mounted onto a solid frame. Galvanized wire is added to the back for secure hanging. 
It is finished with several coats of sealant so the piece will last a lifetime.

{CHOOSING A FINISH}:
*Wood is a natural medium, that will engrave differently every time. There are variances in the grain that will sometimes create darker and lighter sections.  This is what makes them unique; this is beyond our control.
*We engrave natural wood finish and light paint colors at the highest power, to create a dark, deep and detailed engraving.
*We engrave at a lower power for dark paint colors, to eliminate darkening the wood too much and still provide contrast.
{EACH FRAME INCLUDES}:
*Free Personalization
*Glass
*Easel backing
*Clear coat finish or paint color of your choice for long lasting results

            These custom made picture frames are a beautiful combination of simplicity and rustic charm.  This set of 3 separate plank frames is perfect for your mantle piece or that empty wall in need of some character.  The primitive, yet practical design allows for an easy change of photographs with the mounted plastic photo sleeve.  Each sleeve holds a 4x6 picture.
Handcrafted out of pine and plywood, each plank was lovingly roughed up then stained and painted in the colors of your choice.  Each of the frames can be painted with a stain undertone or all three frames can be stained without paint.  Any combination that works for your space I can do!  All frames will be sanded and lightly distressed.  Frames come ready to lean, if you prefer a sawtooth hanger please indicate in the ""notes"" section at checkout!
Pictured here is dark walnut stain and antique white paint.
Each frame is 17"" tall and approximately 7.5"" wide.

            The first issue of Dig Deep! In the intro of this zine, I write that I'm working to figure out how to live a life that’s important to me, and this zine reflects a lot of that. Inside are stories about the idea of home, a spontaneous dance session on an empty train car, & the projects that I do to create the life that I want to lead. There are stories about my public library & a rundown of the out-of-town libraries that I've visited. There’s also a list of zine love, ten word reviews, & a sweet cut and paste layout!

The Claddagh ring (Irish: fáinne Chladaigh) is a traditional Irish ring given as a token of friendship, love and/or as a wedding ring. The design and customs associated with it originated in the Irish fishing village of Claddagh, located just outside the city of Galway. The ring was first produced in the 17th century during the reign of William and Mary, though elements of the design date to the late Roman period.        ",72.96,4.899,"Handmade item

Binding:   Oversize Paperback
Book Condition:   Good
Edition:   First Edition
Publisher:   U.S.A.,  Knopf, 1981
Seller ID:   136032
Book shows considerable wear with first front endpaper missing.  Lightly curled front cover with a notable crease at lower front corner incorporating a 1/4"" tear. Back cover age toned at edges with a slight curl also. 
Text/interior is clean and complete with text and 65 impressive full color, full page plates, all in excellent condition. Binding is solid though somewhat fragile as a perfect-bound 34 year old book. 
""Falkland Road is a notorious street in Bombay lined with old wooden buildings which teem with prostitutes hanging out of the windows, in the viewing cages on the ground floor, and on the steps. From sunrise to sunset the customers pass down the street to survey the girls. Mary Ellen Mark's extraordinary portrait of Falkland Road was first published by Knopf in 1981, and has long been recognized as one of the major bodies of work in the canon of this significant Magnum photographer. The book contains sixty-five photographs made over six weeks that show the daily life lived by the women (and men) of the street. Mark's images are beautiful, electric, shocking, and remarkable for their emotional power and for the visceral brilliance of their color"".

https://www.etsy.com/shop/SamirahCollections?section_id=14772680&ref=shopsection_leftnav_
All of our silverware items are silver plated, they have been treasure hunted and handpicked from local antique stores. Furthermore, after inspecting and before releasing our products into our store inventory they undergo a complex process including hand stamping, cleaning and polishing.
This is not a brand new, never used, flatware. Our vintage inventory had been previously used and there may be some signs of wear. However, we hand polish and wash all these pieces before they reach our customers. Each letter has been hand stamped one by one, that is the reason why each piece is unique and meaningful. Each letter may not line up perfect, but that adds to the charm of a handmade piece!
 	
The ink used to darken the letters is an edible dye but will not stay permanently and will fade overtime. Hand washing is recommended to make the black letters last longer. However, the impression will remain forever because it is stamped into the metal.To preserve the shine of the silver, simply spread tarnish away with any jewelry cloth or tarnish remover

14118,50% OFF Printable Planner Stickers April Monthly View Kit! Spring Flowers Theme!  w/ Cut Files! For Erin Condren LifePlanner,"
            Hello! 
Thanks for checking out my Stickers! These are printable Spring Flower Stickers for April meant for the Monthly View of the Erin Condren Life Planner.
These stickers are for the Erin Condren Planner. The Headers are 6.5"" wide by 1.5"" tall. The boxes are 1.625"" wide by 1.4"" tall.
Do keep in mind that this is a digital product, no physical product will be shipped to you ;-)
After you purchase your files, you will receive an email with a download link. You can also find this download link on your purchases page in your Etsy account. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COMPATIBILITY
* These cut files aren't compatible with Cricut machines to my knowledge. I am in the process of figuring out a way to have those file types available in the future :) *
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PRINT & CUT
You do not have to have a Silhouette to use these stickers. I have included both JPG and PDF files that you can print out and cut yourself!
However, if you do have a Silhouette, you are in luck! All you need to do is open up the files in Silhouette Studio, then print and cut as your normally would! Keep in mind, you may have to adjust the cut settings for your individual paper. The blade depth and speed settings are used on Matte White Vinyl.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PURCHASE INCLUDES
2 High resolution JPG files (size 8.5"" by 11"")
2 PDF Files (size 8.5"" by 11"")
along with a bonus of
*Free* 2 Silhouette Studio Cut Files (size 8.5"" by 11"")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STICKER SET INCLUDES:
2 Monthly Headers
8 Decorative Boxes
Washi Strips to cover Blank Days
Date Covers
Sidebar Ombre Checklists
Sidebar Headers
Bill Stickers
Pay Day Stickers
Icons
Decorative Stickers
Page Flags
Skinny Page Fags
Holiday Stickers
Decorative Page Flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PAPER RECOMMENDATIONS
If you are on a budget, you can order DigiOrange sticker paper from Amazon.com. It is not the highest quality, but still works well.
If you want to use real vinyl, I order full sheets of Matte White Vinyl from PlanetLabel.com. The vinyl is removable/repositionable for the most part as long as you remove the stickers slowly and carefully.

            A NEW SPIN ON AN OLD FAVOURITE
This distressed ""Soul Sisters"" frame can be given as one-of-a-kind gift for your best friend ! All of our frames are carefully hand-painted, hand-distressed, sealed and personalized to fit your vision and enhance your most precious photo memories! This frame can be customized with many different colour options & personalized with two or more letters (***please include this in your notes to seller upon purchase).
This frame fits a 3.7"" x 3.7"" photo and comes with a simple wooden dowel at the back to make for easy display on a shelf or mantelpiece. All of our frames are moderately distressed to create a farmhouse-esque and rustic-inspired look -and because of this, some paint will be chipped/sanded away in certain spots and some lettering may appear faded (if you DO NOT wish to have the distressed look to your frame - please note this in the comments section upon purchase). All frames are also hand-painted on each of the sides as well as the back to allow for display anywhere. There is also a hand-cut plexiglass insert which is included to protect your photo.
Please be as detailed as possible in your notes to seller so that we can ensure your finished product is exactly what you had envisioned. The frame pictured in the second image is shown in OCEAN BREEZE which is not currently available in our custom colour palette however, you may still select it from the Colour drop-down tab.

15013,Alpaca Bits and Pieces for Needle Felting,"
            These “sausages” are stuffed full of 1 oz of 100% alpaca fluff in beautiful natural colors. Wonderful for needle felting projects or small wet felting items! 
These fibers are mixed natural colors of alpaca left over from the spinning and/or carding machine out in the mill. We produce all of our own yarn and roving on ""The Place"" here in Clearmont Wyoming from our super cute herd of alpacas!
There is no organization or color choices with this it is strictly disorganized fluff and pieces from the spinning process in the mill. 
IF you want organization in the fiber you are working with, please look at the ""Alpaca Fuzz Balls"" as that is wonderful roving to work with for felting and/or spinning.
While the sausages have various colors in it, you can request light or dark tones in them.
If you are a fiber crafter and you haven't tried alpaca yet, you need to get your hands on it as soon as possible and feel the luxury of alpaca!
We raise alpacas here on our beautiful ranch in Wyoming! We also run our own fiber mill, so all of our fibers are made on site here in Wyoming. Take a little piece of the west to your neck of the woods!

15285,50% OFF Printable Planner Stickers May Monthly View Kit! Spring Floral Theme! w/ Cut Files! For Erin Condren LifePlanner,"
            Hello! 
Thanks for checking out my Stickers! These are printable Spring Floral Stickers for May meant for the Monthly View of the Erin Condren Life Planner.
These stickers are for the Erin Condren Planner. The Headers are 6.5"" wide by 1.5"" tall. The boxes are 1.625"" wide by 1.4"" tall.
Do keep in mind that this is a digital product, no physical product will be shipped to you ;-)
After you purchase your files, you will receive an email with a download link. You can also find this download link on your purchases page in your Etsy account. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COMPATIBILITY
* These cut files aren't compatible with Cricut machines to my knowledge. I am in the process of figuring out a way to have those file types available in the future :) *
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PRINT & CUT
You do not have to have a Silhouette to use these stickers. I have included both JPG and PDF files that you can print out and cut yourself!
However, if you do have a Silhouette, you are in luck! All you need to do is open up the files in Silhouette Studio, then print and cut as your normally would! Keep in mind, you may have to adjust the cut settings for your individual paper. The blade depth and speed settings are used on Matte White Vinyl.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PURCHASE INCLUDES
2 High resolution JPG files (size 8.5"" by 11"")
2 PDF Files (size 8.5"" by 11"")
along with a bonus of
*Free* 2 Silhouette Studio Cut Files (size 8.5"" by 11"")

PAPER RECOMMENDATIONS
If you are on a budget, you can order DigiOrange sticker paper from Amazon.com. It is not the highest quality, but still works well.
If you want to use real vinyl, I order full sheets of Matte White Vinyl from PlanetLabel.com. The vinyl is removable/repositionable for the most part as long as you remove the stickers slowly and carefully.

15293,Make your our French bulldog head | DIY & craft wall mount | 3D paper sculpture | Printable PDF pattern | Low poly animal trophy to assemble,"
            Make your own paper French bulldog head with our printable PDF pattern!
It’s easy! Just follow the instructions & you will be proud of your low poly animal trophy. Isn’t it a nice & unique wall mount decor for your sweet home? It could be an original gift too if you decide to assemble it for a close friend or a relative. You can even print the pattern & the instructions and give them. It is it a good present idea, isn’t it?
Don’t be afraid, I assembled the sculpture so everybody can do it! You will just need time & precision. Put your music on & enjoy the assemblage! (For me it is a perfect way to relax).
«««««« HOW DOES IT WORK? »»»»»»
► You will be able to download the ZIP file as soon as your purchase will be confirmed. The ZIP file contains the patterns (PDF files to be printed in A4 or A3 format) & the complete instructions in English to make the sculpture. 
► Print the pattern with A3 or A4 paper (choose the format which is more convenient for you, the size of the sculpture is the same with A3 or A4 paper). The paper has to be thick (200 / 300 gsm / grams per square meters). The one I use is 260 gsm & it is perfect for that kind of sculpture. You can print at home if you have a printer or, easier, go to the nearest Print shop, you could buy the paper & print there.
► You have the printed pattern! Now just check you have the following tools: a pair of scissors, a ruler, white paper glue and a tool to fold the paper (could be a scoring tool / cutter pencil or even a small knife). You are ready to begin!
► Now just follow the instructions: cut the parts, fold & glue them. It is easy, all the parts of the pattern are identified with edge number guide for easy assembly (to assemble the paper craft model just match the numbers on the edges with the corresponding number & glue the edges together). 
► Once finished, I recommend painting the sculpture. It will make it stronger & easier to be cleaned. You can personalize it with the color you want or even make it bi-color! With an oil paint or even spray paint, it will look like laminated & your friends won’t believe you made it with paper!
«««««« TECHNICALS DETAILS »»»»»»
► Difficulty Level: Medium (You will need approximately 5 hours to assemble the sculpture)
► 3D Papercraft: French bulldog head
► Approximately size: 36,6 cm / 14.56 in (height), 23,5 cm / 9.4 in (wide), 24 cm / 9.4 in (deep)
► Use thick paper: A4 or A3
► A3 template (PDF): 7 Sheets - 74 Parts
► A4 template (PDF): 14 Sheets - 76 Parts

16204,Silver filled wire ~ 1mm wire ~ Sterling silver filled ~ 18g Silver fill ~ Jewellery supplies ~ Wire wrapping ~ Jewelry wire ~ UK supplier ~,"
            1mm (approx. 18 Gauge) sterling silver filled wire - 2 Metres
You will receive a 2 metre coil of sterling silver filled wire. 
As with gold fill, the sterling silver layer is hundreds of times thicker than a silver plating. Silver filled wire can be manipulated just like sterling silver wire at a fraction of the cost!
The silver is bonded to the core metal and does not flake off the way a plating might. 
This very good quality, 10% silver filled copper wire.  The silver purity is 99.95%
I prefer the copper core metal to the usual brass as it is much easier to work with.
1mm (18g) is perfect for using as base wires when creating intricate wire wrapping.
You can see an example of 1mm wire wrapping here:

Use it for crafting, candle making or lotion. Beeswax is great for woodworking, bow hunting, camping, crafting, lubrication, sewing, artistic molds, candles, and more.  Beeswax candles renewable resource and support local beekeepers produced by bees in the USA. Bees wax considerably higher melting point than conventional paraffin wax candles, which allows them to burn up to 70% longer
Why Beeswax...?
Why Beeswax Candles are the best to burn:
 Beeswax candles contain no lead, benzene, stearic acid or other chemicals found in many other candles therefore they burn cleaner producing virtually no soot. They are  brighter light than other candles, have a natural aroma and honey scent.
   Those with allergies and by those who are sensitive to strong chemical scents can use them.
	Pure beeswax candles actually clean the air as they burn, emitting negative ions which remove dust, pollen, smoke, pet dander and even germs from the air, could help to alleviate many asthma and allergy symptoms
 The many uses of beeswax: 
        Cosmetics:  Beeswax combines with other nourishing oils to make the finest quality salves, lotions, lip balms, etc.  Substitute beeswax in all recipes calling for paraffin or other petroleum-based ingredients.
·          Soap:  Use approximately 2 tablespoons of beeswax per pound of soap with your other oils or as a superfatting agent.  Make a 'milk and honey' soap for a delectable scent using both beeswax and a bit of honey, or just appreciate the properties of beeswax in any fine handmade soap.
·        Water Proofing:  This is the oldest known substance used throughout history to waterproof everything from wood to cloth.  Work it into the threads, wood, or fabric and remove excess.
          Thread Conditioning:  Run your thread through a piece of beeswax then smooth the thread to remove excess beeswax.  The purpose of doing this is to both make the thread stronger and to reduce its tendency to tangle.  This is perfect for any hand sewing, beading, quilting, etc.
·        Bow String:  All bows (recurve, compound, etc.) benefit from regular applications of beeswax.  The tackiness of beeswax helps hold the strings together and give them strength, as well as providing a more secure draw grip.
·        Furniture Polish:  Beeswax and lemon is the ultimate fine furniture polish, and one of the reasons we have so many wood furniture treasures hundreds of years old.        ",1.00,4.625,"Handmade Supply

18377,"Teacher Gift, Teacher Wish Bracelet, Teacher Jewellery, Teacher Thank You Gift, Teacher Card, End of Term Gift, Teacher Bracelet","
            Teacher Wish Bracelet - A lovely gift to give to a special teacher at the end of the academic year.
Perfect to pop inside a gift card or to accompany a present.
Wish Bracelets make special little gifts to give. The idea behind them is you tie the cord around your wrist whilst making a wish. Eventually the cord will wear and the bracelet will fall off and your wish might then come true. 
* DESIGN *
The Wish Bracelet is made using 1.0mm waxed cotton cord which is available in a range of colours.
The cord is approximately 35cm in length and can be trimmed to suit different wrist sizes. Simply tie around wrist, secure with 3 knots and then trim off the excess cord. 
Two pretty Rhodium plated star charms are threaded on the waxed cotton cord and are each 0.5cm wide.
The Wish Bracelet is tied around a card which carries the message 'A Little Wish for a Special Teacher!' and will arrive in a cellophane packet. The card is approximately 11 x 8cm in size. 
Please note, due to the small parts used, my bracelets are not recommended for children 0-3 years of age.
