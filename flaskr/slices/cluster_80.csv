1832,"Vintage Wall Mirror, Farmhouse Mirror, Green Wall Mirror, Rustic Wall Mirror, Country Home Mirror Rustic Home Decor Fixer Upper Style Mirror","
            This vintage wall mirror is looking for a new home. It has a great light green, chippy patina. Please notice in the second photo that a piece of the top is missing. But I really think because the mirror is so wonderful, that won't be noticed, plus it just adds to its history. Makes for fabulous fixer upper or farmhouse decor.
This could go in an entryway, bedroom, bathroom, mudroom, even a nursery.
Measures 14½"" wide by 24"" high.
It is very heavy, weighing over 9 pounds.        ",135.00,4.99,"Vintage item

4800,Vintage Mint Green Glasses -  Oversized Cat Eyeglasses - Clear Lens Glasses - Teal Silver Round Eyeglass Frames - Clear Frame Eyeglasses 18,"
            Easter Week sale! Take 10% off everything in the shop. Hurry - sale ends Saturday!
 These are beautiful 1980s-1990s style frames from Lady Stetson and Zyloware. The plastic frames are a bright mint green and are somewhat transparent.
Please note - these frames are very lightweight and somewhat flexible with a delicate design. They are not rigid like some other styles. Because they have been sitting in storage for over two decades, they may require some adjustment to regain all aspects of their original perfect shape.
They are deadstock ""new old stock"" frames - brand new and unworn.
Each pair comes with demo lenses with the Lady Stetson logo on the bottom of the right lens. This is not a sticker - the words are directly printed on the lens. These glasses are ready to be taken to an optometrist for custom lenses or to be used without lenses.
Getting prescription lenses for eyeglass frames:
All of my eyeglass frames can be given prescription lenses. They're strong and in perfect working condition, and my customers report that they work great with custom lenses. I've had buyers use them for prescription everyday frames, reading glasses, and custom sunglasses.
However, PLEASE NOTE that not every eyecare provider will supply custom lenses for vintage frames. Some large frame suppliers, like LensCrafters and Walmart, will only put lenses in the frames that they sell. 
I STRONGLY recommend giving your eyecare provider a call before purchasing, because not every optometrist will work with vintage frames for a number of reasons.        ",135.00,4.5781,"Vintage item from the 1980s

11310,"Unique Walnut and Cherry Wood Engagement Ring, Jewelry, Ring, Wood Jewelry, Weddings, Wedding Band, Engagement","
            Designed to be simple, but striking with the wood and the craftsmanship on full display.  
Unique and masculine.
I originally I went with cherry on both sides of the brass center. My wife made me change one side to the offset walnut. I need to listen to her more often!
Black Cherry and Walnut heartwood are fused to a solid brass core to make an exceptionally strong and beautiful ring.
5mm wide (about the thickness of 3 US quarters) - see picture – rounded surface
2.5mm thick. (about two US dimes) - inside slightly rounded for comfort 
BEAUTIFUL RING - EXCELLENT SERVICE - DELIVERED ON TIME - GUARANTEED
HOW WOOD RINGS ARE MADE
The two sides of the ring are bonded through the brass insert. This locks all the pieces together, and makes a very strong ring.
Each ring is finished with a tough acrylic, and polished to a brilliant shine. This makes the rings waterproof and suitable for daily wear.
CUSTOMIZED WOOD RINGS
If you have a custom request, just send me a message. I'll be glad to work with you.
SIZING YOUR WOOD RING
The wood rings are slightly rounded on the inside for a ""comfort fit"". They tend to run about a half size larger than standard rings. So if you prefer a nice snug fit, subtract a half size from your normal size.
SHIPPING 
Shipping is free worldwide. When shipping outside the United States, you are responsible for any duties or taxes your country may charge.
WOOD RING WARRANTY
When your wood ring arrives, I hope you love it. And, I hope you're glad you chose my shop. If not, let me know! I'll make you happy. Won't fit; no problem. Clashes with your eye color; no problem. Allergic to wood; no problem. I'll make you happy, or refund your money. Period        ",135.00,4.8462,"Handmade item

19118,Raven Ring with Green Tourmaline Companion - Totem Ring - Bird Ring - Black Raven - Silver Ring - Witch Ring - Nordic Myth Ring,"
            Sterling silver Raven ring with a companion - thin hammered ring set with green tourmaline or another stone of your choice.
This Raven wraps his wing snugly around your finger. He can be your familiar or totem and will protect you with his wing. The stone set in the companion ring can be hidden under Raven's wing to symbolize extra protection (as shown in photo number 4). The Raven is a spiritual guide and assistant. He can also be a watchful guard.
The Raven ring was carved in wax.
You can see the process photos here:

Then it was cast in sterling silver, hand-polished and covered in patina to make the texture of his feathers stand out.

            A Quick note about your designer:
Hi :)
1. I'm a perfectionist
2. Handmade should look as nice if not nicer then store bought.
3. I cherish the relationship between the crafter and customer which is something you don't get when buying from department stores.
Thanks for supporting small business,
Selena
SKIRT DETAILS
This semi-flared, a line, pull on skirt is very unique and fun! You can wear it on your hips or waist with the flexibility of the elastic waist band. I custom make each one to your exact size out of any fabric you heart desires. It features a drop waistband that is cut on the bias so there's little to no bunching from the elastic so it fits flat on your hips. All seams are finish stitched with the extra clean look of french seams along the sides. I've included detailed pictures of how my skirts look inside and out so you can really see what you'll be getting. These skirts are not quickly made for profit each one is handcrafted with care which takes time. Much attention is paid to every little detail of this skirt, all stitches are very straight and professional looking you'll notice this upon closer inspection. It's built to last years and with the bias cut elastic drop waistband it'll still fit as you may loose, or gain weight.
All Fabric is washed in my own homemade natural laundry detergent, and then dried so the fabric is preshrunk ready to be washed and dried many times. I do recommend washing in cold water and line drying to prevent fading and extending your skirts life even longer. All skirts are sewn in a smoke free pet free studio in beautiful Port Orchard Washington with a professional sewing machine.
I purchase the material for each skirt on a as needed basis and then make the size you want. Just send me your hip measurement, and desired length. Standard length is 22.5"" and can be adjusted upon request. For length requests over 24""s will have a additional charge of 5 please purchase:

* Add muslin lining here: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/129983279/add-lining-for-simple-a-line-and-circle?ref=shop_home_active
SIZING:
 *Most important measurement is your hip the widest part of your bum! You can use a ribbon, or string if you don't have a dress makers measuring tape and then add up the inches using a standard ruler. 
* for hip sizes 46""s - 54""s the cost is 8.50 more for extra fabric fabric. Add 1 for each skirt purchased:
