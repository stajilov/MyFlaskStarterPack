            This is a pair of sterling silver earrings with Genuine Rainbow Moonstones.

Moonstone Gemstone meaning:
passionate love that will fly you to the moon
It is said if you give your lover a moonstone necklace when the moon is full you will always have passion with each other. Moonstone is a highly valued gemstone for these reasons: 
Brings good fortune 
Assists in foretelling the future 
Enhances intuition 
Promotes inspiration 
Brings success in love as well as business matters 
Offers protection on land and at sea 
The moonstone is associated with the moon and was the stone of the goddess Diana. The most powerful time to use the moonstone is in a full moon. 
It has been worn as an amulet to bring good emotions to the wearer, while protecting those of a sensitive nature. It can reunite lovers who have quarreled. Moonstone is also considered a good luck stone.
Moonstone is a very personal stone. It is a reflection of the person who owns it. It does not add or detract, only shows how it is. This is why the moonstone is said to perceive that which ""is"". Moonstone is an excellent stone to use in meditation to understand oneself. Placing it in the moonlight of a moon reaching its fullness, not a full or waning moon, can revitalize it. This is a particularly good gemstone for women. It is a good stone for young women or teenagers.
Healing properties of Moonstone
Moonstone is used by healers to stimulate the functioning of the pineal gland and balance internal hormone cycles with nature's rhythms. Moonstone is a stone of inner growth and strength. Though often considered to be a woman's stone, it can be beneficial to men in opening the emotional self.        ",49.00,4.9218,"Vintage item

            Beautiful cane striped carafe or pitcher from Gio Ponti for his friend Venini, either in 1946 or 1958 depending on the source. 
Condition: Excellent. Bubbles from manufacture appear mostly toward the base and bottom. 
Size: 8.25"" high, 6"" across
There appears to be an etching, perhaps a maker's mark, on the partially ground pontil. 
We are told by the Internet that this carafe appears in ""CIRCA FIFTIES GLASS FROM EUROPE AND AMERICA"" by Leslie Pina on page 54, but we can't find our copy and are unable to verify!

7808,Kombucha Scoby with Starter Tea,"
            Kombucha has earned a lot of attention for its health benefits, but buying it everyday at 3.50 a pop can get expensive. (Because of course, to really benefit, you're supposed to drink it daily.)  You're making a great choice by brewing your own. The first time you taste it, you'll be blown away by the difference between home brewed and store bought.  There is hardly a comparison. 
Brewing your own also gives you a world of possibilities for healthy add-ins.  Right now we're in the middle of cold season. I'm brewing kombucha with cranberries and fresh ginger. It tastes great, and I know we're getting a little punch of nutrition and cold defense in the process.
 
So you want to buy a scoby, but why should you buy it here?
We begin with Artesian well water, collected right here at the source, that is rich in minerals and has no chemicals or additives that can compromise growth or decrease beneficial effects.
We take care of our scobys. We never outsource them or buy from other providers. Every scoby we sell is grown here, under optimal conditions, and talked to daily. We have minimum standards for scobys, and refuse to send anything mediocre. We don't run a huge operation, so our little guys get a lot of TLC, and when they ship they are ready to go to a new home and get brewing!
Because we want each scoby to thrive, we package very carefully. We don't pre-package scobys, so you can be sure your scoby hasn't been sitting around on a shelf in plastic packaging.  We package first in a 4 mil heavy duty zipper bag, then heat seal to prevent leaks. We then put this bag inside of a heavier plastic bag, and heat seal again. This secures the scoby and provides a little insulation too. We then place this package in a bubble mailer, so by the time your scoby leaves, it is protected by three layers of plastic. We have very few issues with damage during shipment due to this process, which we arrived at by trial and error.
We ship all scobys either the day of order or the day after. We understand that people want their product quickly. (Just like us!) We ship everything first class with tracking so you can see the progress of your order.
When we ship, we ship by weight. Scobys are each a little bit different, so we first put the scoby in, then top it up with as much starter tea as we can, so you get the most for your money.  We send a minimum of 8 ounces, and sometimes more depending on the weight of the scoby.
I was raised by very generous people, and we try to emulate that spirit, sending only rich, tart starter tea that will get your brew going very quickly. We order high quality organic loose leaf teas and blend our own, to ensure a bold smooth taste.
We do send complete instructions for brewing, but we are also here to trouble-shoot or assist you with your brewing goals. Send us a conversation anytime, and we will respond promptly until you have the results you are looking for.  We know from experience that the first brew is full of uncertainty, and we are happy to talk you through the process.
If you have any questions about our scobys, please do not hesitate to contact us via Etsy conversation, or email  susan [!at] zenobiasgarden.com
P.S.
Already have that classic kombucha? We also brew several varieties, including Tibetan, Hibiscus, and Butterfly Pea kombucha. Check it out at our store!
All of our orders ship with USPS tracking. We do ship internationally, but cannot be responsible for loss or damage occuring through customs or through delayed delivery in other countries. We track each shipment closely, and see an average delivery time overseas of about 10 days. If you choose to order international, please be aware you assume responsibility for delivery of product.        ",6.00,4.9823,"Handmade item

8899,Sensitive Skin Deodorant,"
            NEW JASMINE VANILLA SCENT!
At long last we've created a that works incredibly well for those with sensitive pits! No harsh sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), loads of clay to keep you dry and comfortable, and made with an amazing blend of essential oils to keep you fresh all day long without irritation! So effective we can now offer unscented pit stick!
(Sensitive Skin) Natural Deodorant That Actually Works! How did we do it?
 
*We start with Organic Virgin Virgin Coconut oil, a remarkably effective natural deodorant that moisturizes and soothes the most sensitive skin. 
 *A propriatary blend of mild, skin loving essential oils lend an amazingly clean and fresh scent! Choose from Jasmine Vanilla, Bergamot Vanilla or Lavender & Fir.
Or if you want no scent at all, choose Naked (unscented).
 *Kaolin clay and organic arrowroot powder fight wetness and bacteria, while (non GMO) soy wax and oils of tamanu & neem soothe your worst razor burns and rashes. Your pits will be super soft, show them off if you must!
 *Finally we add our natural secret weapon, and amazingly effective odor absorbing ingredient. Zinc Ricinoleate! Don't worry, its not as scary as trying to pronounce it. Zinc ricinoleate is the zinc salt of ricinoleic acid, a major fatty acid found in castor seed oil obtained from the seeds of the Ricinus communis plant. Its amazingly effective at absorbing odor and as always, a safe naturally derived ingredient in our arsenal. 
 *No propylene glycol, or aluminum, baking soda or any other irritating chemicals, just pure natural ingredients that work together to keep you smelling sweet even after a work out!
*So little is needed to keep you smelling fresh this tube will last a long, long time. Our durable tubes contain 2.5 ounces of sweet smelling, buttery soft, pit freshener. 
Unlike some natural deodorants this will keep working all day and night for you, without that sticky feeling. And it won't crap out on you in the morning either. And unlike some other ""natural"" deodorants, this is truly natural, without synthetic ingredients! The natural oils and waxes soak in almost immediately, even for those who aren't clean shaven. Have no fear, it won't leave a grease stain on your shirt like one may be imagining now....your skin will feel soft like you have nothing on at all within minutes of applying it. Give it a try, you have only stinky to lose!
INGREDIENTS:
Soy wax(non-gmo), Organic virgin coconut oil, Organic arrowroot powder, Kaolin Clay, Zinc Ricinoleate, Organic neem oil, Tamanu oil, Rosemary extract, Essential oils (proprietary blend).
***Castor oil is obtained by the cold pressing of seeds of the Ricinus communis plant followed by clarification of the oil by heat. Some people ask whether or not castor oil and its derivatives contain the highly toxic compound ricin. Castor oil does not contain ricin because ricin is water soluble and does not dissolve in the oil obtained from the castor beans.
***If you have allergies to some essential oils please contact us about the exact oils used. We are happy to help.        ",2.00,4.8801,"Handmade item

9648,"Blue and Neon Orange Fidget Toy for Autism, ADD, ADHD & Idle Hands","
            We first began making these fidgets to help lower stress levels at work. We found that after staring at a computer monitor or talking on the phone all day, doing something to keep our hands busy lead to a happier day at work. Shortly after making one and using it for a couple of days, co-workers began to ask what it was and where they could get one. It quickly became an office hit!
In addition to giving your hands something to do, it can be used to reduce stress and anxiety as well as increase your focus and attention levels. They are perfect for people who suffer from attention deficit disorder, autism or just feel fidgety all of the time.
All fidgets are hand made from actual bike chains that have been cleaned and de-greased. Please note, since they are made of actual bike chains, the finish may include certain imperfections. All metal parts are stainless steel to prevent rusting.        ",8.00,4.9218,"Handmade item

10205,Yin // Bare Naked Dance Weight Hula Hoop // Untaped Hoop,"
            Simple. Sleek. Slow. Named Yin for its weight and color, feel yourself become grounded and connected with the Earth in this beautifully minimalistic hoop. With all of the tapes stripped away, you are left with nothing but yourself and your flow. 
Is this your first hoop? Need one-on-one help to get things started? Private Skype lessons are available through Jonathan Ondina (shop owner). Send a message to learn more!
~Tubing~
This hoop can be made of 3/4 polyethylene (PE) tubing or 7/8"" HDPE. The 3/4"" PE and 7/8"" HDPE tubings are a perfect weight and width for practice/core dance hoops, or for those just beginning their hoop flow journey. The main difference between the two tubings is that the HDPE comes with a push-button connector, and PE comes with a grey barbed connector (not as easily collapsible).
~Connector~
This listing without any add-ons uses one grey barbed connector for PE hoops. Just heat up the tubing to insert/remove the connector for easy collapsing! For even easier collapsing, check out this add-on for an infinity-style collapsible hoop: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/243476083/infinity-style-collapsible-add-on?ref=shop_home_active_6
HDPE hoops use push button connectors. 
*ALL HOOP SIZES ARE MEASURED BY OD. If you want them measured by their ID please let me know.  
If this is your first hoop and you arenât sure what size to get, measure the length, in inches, from your belly button to the floor. This number would be the suggested hoop size for your individual body. Although it may seem large, the extra inches will allow you to learn moves with more ease since there is more room inside of the hoop. The bigger sizes also move more slowly, allowing more time for you to execute moves as you are learning them. 
*IF YOU LIVE IN THE EAST ORLANDO AREA (by UCF), message me so we can arrange a pickup. I will give you the coupon code to void the cost of shipping. :)        ",9.00,4.748,"Handmade item

If the decal is put on wrong or messed up during application I am NOT responsible to making a new one without payment. 
**PRICE IS FOR ONE NAME/WORD. If you'd like a saying example: team Kincaid (you will need to order 2 in the size you want). Please be aware that more than one word will be hard to put on a yeti kind of cup unless it is stacked. Also, the size of the decal if going on a yeti like cup if stacked will be the total of both or all words together. Message me if you have questions before ordering!!**

 & add ITEM to cart. The extra fee pays for your item made within 1-2 days, to be pushed ahead of everyone else's & shipped out PRIORITY (1-3 days)****
=========================================================================
**NOTE: the size of the decal is determined by the HEIGHT, the length is determined by the number of letters in the name. Height will be measured by the top of the tallest letter to the bottom of the longest letter...FOR EXAMPLE: Jessica - J will determine the HEIGHT of the decal since it is a LONGER letter, as well as letters like L, T, Y, G etc. For names like Susan, Anna etc. the name will be bigger than Jessica if ordered in the SAME size, because all of the letters in lowercase (like the font comes) are shorter. If you have questions you can always request a preview of your name**
I do recommend you messaging me to see what size you want/need if you are unsure. SOME names can be longer when they are higher because of the number of letters. This font comes in ALL lowercase. It is LONG in general because it is a Handwritten Signature kind of design. 
--MOST customers do a 2"" for a yeti cup, however if you are afraid it will be too long, contact me BEFORE purchasing! If you have a name with 1-4 letters you can try a 3"" decal for a yeti. However, like stated please make sure to message me if you are worried it won't fit--
=========================================================================
***AGAIN- PLEASE BE AWARE that this font comes in ONLY LOWERCASE and SOME letters may not look exactly the way you want. If you are unsure of what your name will look like message me for a proof. (Example: names beginning with the letter R look different)***
-----NOTE: I am NOT responsible if you order the wrong color, size or you put it on wrong/mess it up. I am not responsible if you do not like your name in the signature font or the color once you receive it if you DO NOT ask for a preview. You will have to reorder for a new one!-----

The switch is still easy to operate, and the lights and battery pack will be submersible.
The pieces come with the batteries already loaded.  They are ready to use.  Replacement batteries may be hard to find and can be expensive, so we are offering them here.  The batteries come in packs of 4 for 1.00.  That makes the batteries 25 cents each.  Pull down the menu to purchase additional batteries.  Look for the 4, 20, or 40 Extra CR2032 options.

Allow 4-8 weeks to create your custom item.  Contact me for rush orders or to discuss pricing discounts on multiple items.
Please select your color and finish.  I have a wide variety of options to match your wedding or home decor.  
I have a few finishes from which to choose:  Solid, Distressed, White Wash, Antiqued, and Vintage. 
FINISH DESCRIPTIONS
Solid:               one color painted all over.
Distressed:     one color painted all over, with edges and a few spots sanded down to reveal natural wood
                             (Can also be painted two colors so the base color shows through when sanded instead of
                               the natural wood showing)
White Wash:   one color painted all over, with edges and a few spots sanded down to reveal natural wood, 
                               then a white wax will be applied all over to ""whiten"" the natural wood.
Antique:          one color painted all over, with edges and a few spots sanded down to reveal natural wood, 
                               then a brown wax will be applied all over to ""darken"" the natural wood.
Vintage:          one base color painted all over, a crackling process is applied, then a top color is painted all 
                                over.  This process gives it the ""chippy paint look""
Each piece is sanded and painted with several coats.  Finally, I  hand draw any message you like on your box, in any font, and seal the entire board to make it last for years to come.

  I make extra sure that your sweet terrarium arrives in one piece, by wrapping this beauty up thrice in bubble wraps, in two consecutive containers. 
  To take care of your terrarium/box do not use any chemicals for cleaning. Run it under luke warm water and let it dry, or wipe it gently with a soft cloth.

We offer all of our molds in food grade and non food grade silicone. You can use the food grade silicone mold for chocolate, fondant, sugar, candy, butter or any other edible below 395 degrees Fahrenheit. Non Food Grade Silicone rubber is an excellent product for a variety of other materials including wax, soap, gypsum/plaster, epoxy, PMC, all types of resin, polymer clay, paper or anything else you can think of.  
Molds are flexible with no need for a releasing agent, your finished piece will just pop out of the mold like magic. 
A little about our process: To create the highest quality mold with the most intricate detail, we take the extra time to pour the silicone to create your mold. We donât press the item into silicone putty since this method would not pick up detail. To insure your mold is of the highest quality I use a vacuum system to remove any air from the silicone. My 18 years of experience in silicone mold making assures that the mold you purchase will yield perfect castings. Using only the finest American made silicone for your molds will guarantee quality reproductions for many years. We guarantee you will receive professional quality molds. 
*The original items used to create the mold are not included. You are purchasing the mold only.
 *We are always adding new molds so please check out our shop
* DO NOT use the Non Food Grade mold for food.  
*On more intricate molds you may wish to put the filled mold in the freezer for a few minutes to avoid distortion when de-molding.        ",0.20,4.9915,"Handmade item

15854,Silver Catholic Archangel Gabriel Medal with Prayer on Back,"
            This is a listing for a lovely silver plated pewter charm (made in Italy).
A very special Archangel Gabriel charm with beautiful detailing. Heavily silver plated. Will never tarnish!
Very special prayer is detailed on the back, with the saying:
""Oh dear Gabriel, helps us to be diplomatic and watch over us, as you did with Christ gives us the strength to reason and the humility to listen""
Because of Gabriel's role as a communicator and mediator between Heaven and Earth, Catholics hold the Archangel to be a Patron Saint of broadcasters, telecommunications workers, diplomats, messengers, postal workers, and stamp collectors. Because Gabriel helped the prophet Daniel interpret his dreams, those seeking similar aid with their own dream work may petition the Archangel for help. Additionally, because Gabriel announced the births of both John the Baptist and Jesus Christ, women hoping for heavenly assistance in trying to conceive children have reported benefits from keeping an Angel Gabriel novena candle burning in the home.
Measures approximately 1 inch. Perfect for necklaces, bracelets, chaplets or any other jewelry designs.
Lead and nickel safe.        ",2.00,4.9823,"Craft type: Beading
