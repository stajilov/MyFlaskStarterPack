5218,Rare Antique 1930s Embroidered Boudoir Pillow Sage Green New Filler,"
            This beautiful hand embroidered 1930s flapper boudoir pillow is truly a collector's piece.
Sage green, hand embroidered with white daisies and little pink roses.
I've inserted a new pillow form into the vintage pillow case and tacked the open end in three places with needle and thread, duplicating the original method on the other end.
Measures 13 x 19 inches.
In good vintage condition, fabric and embroidery are sound. Some discolorations at the edges. 
Some staining.
Lace is very brittle and torn in some spots. On other pillows I have removed the lace altogether because of the condition. If you prefer the lace removed, just mention that in the notes to seller.
Shipping overages happily refunded.        ",39.00,4.8947,"Vintage handmade item from the 1930s

            A Custom Made Pet Portrait
This listing is for an original, custom made, hand painted portrait of your beloved pet.  The artwork is hand painted on a 8x10 stretched canvas, painted using high quality acrylic paints.  My pet portraits are generally an up-close detailed painting of your pets’ face and part of their chest with a solid colored background.  
8x10 on stretch canvas:  
PLEASE NOTE:   FOR MORE THAN ONE PET: SEND ME A CONVERSATION TO GET A PRICE QUOTE
All items pictured here are examples only.
Use the custom request link on the bottom of the picture to purchase your Custom Portrait!
When you are ready to order, just “add to cart” and email or Etsy message me with photographs of your pet.  Once I receive the photos, I can get started on your painting.  
I will need 3 to 4 high quality, clear photographs of your beautiful pet. I would love a great quality close up of their face that really shows their eyes / nose and their expression.  The more details I can see, the better the portrait.
If you would like a particular color / shading on the background just let me know, otherwise I can choose one that compliments your pets coloring.  
Since I do all of my painting as a hobby, I have to paint around my work schedule.  Generally it takes about 2 weeks to complete a pet portrait.  If you need something sooner, please message me for a time frame.

“These portraits are spot on, all seven of them! Tracy was able to capture each of our pets’ signature characteristics, cock of a head, the way an ear rests, shiny eyes.  I am so impressed and look forward to hiring her again and again to memorialize or celebrate all of our friends’ and relatives’ pets.  Plus, she is a pleasure to work with. Her love for animals comes through on canvas.
“I love my painting of ‘my girl Onyx’.  The painting seemed so real, just like the photo.  The quality of the painting was excellent. I was not able to tell the difference from the photo to the actual painting.”
“I got the paintings today!! Thank you so much, I just love them!!!  Also, the greeting cards are awesome.  Such a nice surprise.”
“Tracy, my niece just opened her pet portrait and absolutely LOVES it.  She said it exactly captures Stella’s expression.  Thank you so much! She’s thrilled.”
""Oh my word..... I just opened up your painting..... you have touched my heart so much and captured her sweet little innocent personality SO well. I will never be able to thank you enough and then for adding in the precious note cards. You are too much!!!!!! Thank you a million times over. 😘""

***
This retro telephone was made in 1991. And seems like it was never used. Has some scratches and stains, but no cracks or missing parts. 
Working, ringing. Fully serviced and fixed. 
The sound is clear.
This model does not have a classical bell for ringing but the sound is not electronic chirping. This phone rattles (sort of like a baby toy), when somebody calling. Please, mind. 
RJ11 jack was installed by me. This is standart phone jack in many countries nowadays. US for sure. 
Please, before ordering, check whether your telecom provider (telephone exchange, automatic telephone station) supports pulse dialling. Pulse dialing is used in old rotary phones. In modern phones tone dialling is used.

The question everyone asks me is: do these have the original drawings banned by so many school libraries? The answer is Yes indeed!
Box shows wear, bumps, bends and chipping/tears. The books have minor edge and shelf wear. Each one has been read and shows bends on front and back covers and bumps. They show a bit of rubbing along the spine from being put in the box with some corner wear. All details can be seen in the photos. Some soiling, dents, and dings on books and the box. All three have name inside cover in pen.
This is the regular full size edition of these books.
3 Book set by Alvin Schwartz
Illustrated by Stephen Gammell (the really scary drawings!)
You will get:
Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark
Scary Stories 3 More Tales to Chill Your Bones

WHY EMERALDS?
The first known emerald mines were in Egypt, dating from at least 330 BC into the 1700s. Cleopatra was known to have a passion for emerald, and used it in her royal adornments. Emeralds from what is now Colombia were part of the plunder when sixteenth-century Spanish explorers invaded the New World. Wearing an emerald was believed to reveal the truth or falseness of a lover’s oath as well as make one an eloquent speaker. Legend also states that emerald was one of the four precious stones given by God to King Solomon.
Emerald is known as a ""stone of successful love;"" instilling sensitivity and loyalty, and is a stone to bring harmony to all areas of one's life. Emeralds enhance memory and stimulate greater mental capacity.
Today, most of the world's emeralds are mined in Colombia, Brazil and Zambia. The birthstone for the month of May, Emerald is the gemstone for twentieth and thirty-fifth wedding anniversaries.  -- AGTA, GIA, and various additional sources

•✦ SACRED GEOMETRY ✦•
In nature, we find patterns, designs and structures from the most minuscule particles, to expressions of life discernible by human eyes, to the greater cosmos. These inevitably follow geometrical archetypes, which reveal to us the nature of each form and its vibrational resonances. They are also symbolic of the underlying metaphysical principle of the inseparable relationship of the part to the whole. It is this principle of oneness underlying all geometry that permeates the architecture of all form in its myriad diversity. This principle of interconnectedness, inseparability and union provides us with a continuous reminder of our relationship to the whole, a blueprint for the mind to the sacred foundation of all things created.

18557,Simple Medical Alert Bracelet in Sterling Silver / Medical ID Bracelet Custom Personalized Large Bar ID Bracelet LayeredLong LB160_38_B_mb,"
            Stylish Sterling Silver ID Bracelet: A medical alert bracelet that's not ugly...since no one else seems to be making one!   If you're not looking for an alert bracelet that's not also an attention grabbing accessory, this one's for you.  It's subtle, but will work as needed, if needed.  
………………………………….
ABOUT THE BRACELET:
- All components are sterling silver
- The Large Legacy Bar is 38x6mm
- Choose from 3 styles of chain for your bracelet (see photo #2)
- Made to Order at your size (sizing note below)
- Customized Inscription on the inside of the bracelet (see note below)
………………………………….
HOW TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR BRACELET:
Step 1:
- Check out Photo #2 and decide on your favorite chain style 
- (You'll select this style in the 2nd drop down menu, along with the letter style you prefer)
Step 2:
- Figure out what you need your inscription to say
- Count the Characters
- Make sure that there are no more than 30 characters (including spaces) on each line.
Step 3:
- Check out Photo #3...
- If there are less than 25 characters on each line, then you can choose if you want the WIDE or NARROW letter style
- If there are more than 25 characters on 1 line, then we will have to use our NARROW letter style
- Choose the ""W"" (wide) or ""N"" (narrow) style in the 2nd drop down menu, or if you want to have a Mix of both styles, choose ""M"" (mixed).
Step 4:
- When you checkout, make sure to leave a note in the message box with your personalization details.
- Then we will personalize your bracelet with hand-stamped characters!
NOTE 1:
- The outside of the bracelet will by default have just the Caduceus on the Left of the Bar.
- If there's something else you'd like to include on the front, just leave a note in the message box with the details, or contact us for help :)
………………………………….
SIZE/LENGTH:
- This is the final length the bracelet will be made at
- To get a fit that's not too loose or too tight, add 1/4""-1/2"" to your actual wrist measurement
- (wrap a piece of string around your wrist and measure it)
- If you're not sure of the measurement, you can add a 1"" extender to your bracelet:

QUALITY: to make the perfect tulle skirt, we were looking for material for 4 months! Most of tulle, which is offered for the production - is made from hard tulle, with a cheap gloss finish, not matte, not airy and looks very cheap. When we found the right tulle material, we were just happy! It is used for the production of expensive wedding dress and veils! It is light, airy, without any cheap gloss, tulle is matt luxury finish and very gentle! Next there is a problem to choose a good lining material for lining and skirt belt. This is very important, because cheap lining is stretch, lose its first shape, appear the arrow on the material, most sellers do not handle the lining edge and they use the cheapest material to reduce the cost of goods. We chose quality lining material which consists of 50% silk! This is a luxury Italian silk satin. All edges of the pad are processed correctly and with sewing technology. Lining is extended to the bottom, so walking was convenient. Our tulle skirt is very high quality and made with love and without economy on materials. You will be satisfied!

20418,Custom Needlepoint Belt,"
            There is no denying the stylish and elegant nature of a needlepoint belt. As traditional as they are fun, our handmade belts are detailed and of the highest quality. Each needlepoint belt also includes a free monogram to make it even more special. 
The design in the photo is a nautical flag belt, but if you'd prefer a 100% custom design made for you, we'd love to help!  
In your order notes, let us know what you have in mind, including:  
-Belt Size
-Background Color
-Monogram
-Images (you can attach images in an Etsy message, links to them in the notes, if you want us to find something that is also fine)
We will email you a preview for you review and we will adjust as many times as is needed to get it just right.  We don't make any orders until the design has been approved.  It normally takes us 1-4 days to get your preview ready.
Your design is made specific to your belt size, so we email you a preview of your belt to be approved before we make one stitch. It is important that you have the right size on your needlepoint belt, so make sure to read the sizing guide to assure you are getting the size that will fit you.  See the image above to see how to measure.  Be sure to measure to the hole most worn, not necessarily the middle hole.  If you do not have an existing belt to measure, normally 2 - 3 inches larger than the pant size works.
Since we create only the finest quality needlepoint belts, we offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. For this reason, we ask that you take your time when reviewing and measuring prior to us making the needlepoint belt. Remember that it will take us about 8-12 weeks to stitch and finish your needlepoint belt.        ",185.00,4.98,"Handmade item
