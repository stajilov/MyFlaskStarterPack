SCENT OPTIONS:

OTHER INFO PLEASE READ!
*Please note that any deeply pigmented product has the potential to stick to residue in your tub or on your skin.  A VERY CLEAN TUB IS RECOMMENDED BEFORE USING ANY BATH COLORANTS, IT IS ALSO RECOMMENDED TO SHOWER WITH SOAP AFTER TO REMOVE ANY ADDITIONAL RESIDUE IF NEEDED.  Older tubs may experience discoloration over time due to their porous nature. Any product residue not removed by water can be cleaned using dish soap (my favorite) or other cleaner depending on what type of tub you have.
*Please also understand that because these bath bombs are handmade, and the size of your tub may vary compared to someone else's, the color of your bath water may vary from person to person. We try our best to make the best shades possible, but because of these differences there will be variations. Be wary about adding too many bath bombs at once, which can over concentrate your water color and lead to staining.
To make sure you get the best quality during use, make sure to keep your bath bombs in a dry cool place out of direct sunlight. A wet environment can lead to a decrease in the fizz by causing an early reaction, and too much sunlight can fade the beautiful colors in the bath bombs.
SHIPPING AND RETURNS
Products are carefully shipped from Rochester, NY within the domestic United States only.
We can not accept returns due to the fragile nature of our products. Please feel free to contact us if there is any damage to the product and we will do our best to make things right.

Hello and WELCOME to my shop CleanCutCreative where all designs are handmade especially for your Silhouette Cameo, Cricut Explore and other digital cutting machines to ensure an easy clean-cutting experience ;-)
✒----------✂----------✂----------- CONTENTS ----------✂----------✂----------✒
This DIGITAL cutting file is based on the font BEETLE. A modern calligraphy script font, great for creating beautiful text-art, scrapbooking or quotes! 
I manually modified each letter to make sure they are bold enough for your machine and will cut nice and easy. Letters and elements can be resized up and down and filled in any colour to suit your needs! These professional designs will cut smooth and clean, unlike auto-traced pictures.
Perfect for Vinyl Decal for wooden signs, Heat Transfer Vinyl (HTV) for t-shirts, creating inspirational sayings, make a lovely gift or coffee-mug and whatever your creative mind can come up with!
These files are designed to use in Silhouette Studio, Cricut Design Space, Sure Cuts a Lot (SCAL) and other popular cutting software that accept these files. Before purchasing please make sure your cutting machine is compatible with any of the file formats provided.

✒----------✂----------✂--ABOUT CLEANCUTCREATIVE --✂----------✂----------✒
I am a freelance graphic designer and stay-at-home mom residing in the Netherlands, where I usually work on designing logo's and corporate identities.
My love for vector-based art and lettering lead me to the Silhouette Cameo and ETSY. Since I have a Cameo myself I know what works and what doesn't so I can make sure my files are easy to cut ;-)
I really enjoy the fact that YOU make MAGIC HAPPEN and create beautiful crafts or products in ways I couldn't even have imagined! I'd love to see them being posted in a review!
Since English is not my native language I may have made some spelling errors, for which I apologize. If anything is not clear to you please feel free to contact me and I will be happy to help!
I am working hard to add new cutting files soon, so please come back to check them out! 
✒--------✂-------✂- TERMS, CONDITIONS & LEGAL INFO -✂--------✂-------✒

Regarding the ALPHABET CUTFILES: 
I do not claim intellectual property of the fonts. I have written consent of the font-designers in person and bought a (special) license for all alphabet cutfiles in my shop.

If using for cutting: You are responsible for making sure that the file formats offered here are compatible with your machine/software... PRIOR to purchasing. Because of the digital nature of this product, refunds are not available. 
I am only familiar with the silhouette cameo software, you DO NOT have to have the designer edition to cut these. You can open and cut a jpeg or png using the trace tool. It is very easy and takes just seconds to do. After tracing it becomes completely scalable {like the svg} and can be made as large or small as needed. You can also separate the pieces (if using more than one color), by releasing the compound path. If you need any help, I am happy to send instructions.

- All colors are represented in our photos 
- Please click the ZOOM magnifying glass to see the colors labeled for easy selection.
Our Original Glue Gun Sealing Wax has revolutionized the sealing wax industry!
This is an actual wax molded to fit a glue gun, allowing one to create seals without the soot contamination of a flame.
Easily & quickly place melted wax into exact position for embossing.
Production time when using glue gun sealing wax is almost ten time faster than traditional methods.
* For use in standard full sized, low temperature glue gun 
(not mini craft size)
* One 3 3/4"" x 7/16"" wax stick will create approximately 8 to 10 seals with a 3/4"" wax stamp. 
💌   Glue Gun Sealing Wax is flexible, strong holding, and ideal for mailing.
It withstands postal processing well *
As a bonus, it is FDA certified for direct contact with food, 
making it the ideal wax for bottle topping and food packaging. 🍾
FDA Certification 21CFR- 172.886 and 21CFR-178.3710.
=================================================================
☞  Please remember that adding the weight and thickness of a wax seal to your mailed item may increase the postage required for mailing.  
If in doubt, take a completed item to your postal office for a postage quote.
If you opt to have items hand cancelled, your postal office may charge a fee for this service.
☞  Postal offices use many automated machines for stamp canceling and sorting.
These machines could potentially smear/remove wax seals, even if created with mailable waxes.
Please consider using your seal on the inside of your mailing to avoid seal damage, as well as possible extra costs from your postal office.        ",1.50,4.918,"Handmade Supply

5 Flux Brushes for applying flux.
Please don't leave your brush in the flux while you are working as it gets too much flux on the brush and this is one way of getting too much flux on your piece!
If, when you solder, your pieces hisses or sizzles...that is your piece 'telling you' that you have applied too much flux. Too much flux and your solder line won't be as smooth.
You can use these for patina but we much prefer to us cotton balls so we can rub the patina into the piece.

15759,"Recycled sari silk ribbon handdyed in Buddleia, 10metre length, textile arts, jewellery making, bouquet wrap, rose quartz pink, lilac purple","
            A 10-metre (11 yards) length of recycled sari silk ribbon handdyed in the pretty Buddleia colourway of pale pinks and lilacs.
The ribbon is a by-product from the manufacture of sari silk; the strips of fabric are tied or sewn together by women's cooperatives in India. I have handdyed these ribbon yarns in various colourways here in Cornwall, England. 
Due to the handmade and handdyed nature of the ribbon yarn each pack may differ, and will contain raw edges, knots and seams, and varying widths of ribbon (approx 3mm to 30mm if ironed flat) along its length.
The ribbon is packaged in a resealable plastic bag, as shown in the last picture, enabling you to store it easily until required.
Perfect for many crafts including collage, felting, scrapbooking, embroidery, embellishing, weaving, tassle making, braiding, card making, toy making, jewellery making etc.

Your wire will come with the same finish/look as the picture here. The finish is generally pretty consistent and smooth with an occasional rough spot or flake in finish. Remember these need heavy duty pliers to cut, they will shred your normal clippers/nippers! Please note, the clear ear nuts on the ends of the wires in the third photo, are not included. The wire in this listing does not come with end caps. I am currently trying to find a good source for some, however. :)
Even man-made beads and components have variations to them. Keep in mind that color variance can occur from one monitor to another. These are presented as close to as what is in hand as possible.
** Beads/Components may appear larger in the photos to show detail
** Any props, dishes, trays or other mechanisms to hold items are NOT included
