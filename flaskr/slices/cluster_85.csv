1151,Antique diamond and gold Gypsy Engagement Ring,"
            This antique gold Gypsy Ring with single diamond is a size 6 1/4 and, according to my local jeweler, should not be re-sized to fit my size 4 pinkie, and should probably also not be stretched larger. This would make a very lovely affordable engagement ring if you know you sweetheart's ring size!  The condition is good.  I believe it is rose gold.  It is also marked, but I am unable to read it.  Happy to supply more photos.        ",550.00,5.0,"Vintage item from 1900 - 1909

12516,Genuine Australian LEATHER Bow Tie - Repurposed Leathers with Character,"
            Thank you for stopping by and looking at my genuine leather bow ties. I handcraft these bow ties using reclaimed Australian leathers which means they exude warmth and character. Once I have found the perfect leather I hand burnish the leather edges with beeswax which gives and elegant bevelled edge - it really sets our ties apart. I choose only to use heavy waxed cotton which provides a stunning contrast on your bowtie - but it's only on the reverse side, so for your enjoyment only!
Our bow ties are fastened using vintage styled leather fasteners and are fully adjustable for a great fit. The buckles I use are also repurposed. The tie is approx 10cm wide - however - if you would like a different width, please just let me know!
The leather bow tie is very popular not only for weddings, but for rodeo bull riders and looks amazing with a checked shirt! Dress it up or dress it down. Each bow tie is handmade and being made from a natural leather, it does feature all the eccentricities of natural leather. 
We are able to make ties in any colour of leather that you require, HOWEVER, as we make our bowties from reclaimed leathers, please check with me first if you require a shade other than a brown (as pictured) or black bowtie. We do have other leathers available, but they change constantly. If you have a leather that you would like to use, it's no trouble for you to send it to us and we can make your ties using that - but please be in touch first to ensure it's the right size etc etc.
Your bow tie is made to order and I will post it within 6 working days of receiving your order, if you choose and express order, it will be posted within 3 working days.

            The bow ties are attached to a Velcro strap that wraps around the neck under the collar. They also have two layers of bows to keep them looking crisp and in place. The bow ties have two inches of Velcro which allows for adjusting. The men's size has metal adjusting hardware instead of Velcro. The suspenders are also adjustable with two metal slides, and four clips. The suspenders have a width of 1 inch and cross in the back.
If you are worried about the color matching I would be happy to send you a free fabric swatch. Just message me with your name, address, and the name of the color sample you would like.
