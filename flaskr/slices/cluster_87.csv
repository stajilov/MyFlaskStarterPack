DETAILS:
- Your artwork will be printed on gallery quality Epson Archival Matte paper. We find this paper gives smooth and solid colours and crisp edging to the fonts. Perfect for our bold and clean style of art. The paper is very smooth, with hardly any texture. It's closer to a Baryta paper than a Watercolour paper. 
- Prints are 300dpi in resolution. This ensures very crisp lettering and bright, vivid colours. Your print will be fade resistant for a very long time, provided you keep it out of direct sunlight.
- Prints will be sent FLAT in a cellophane packet and placed inside a hard cardboard mailing envelope.
- All orders will be dispatched within 1-2 business days.
- All Domestic orders will be sent via Royal Mail First Class.
- All International orders will be sent via Royal Mail Airmail. This service has an ETA of 5-10 days approx. (Sometimes items can take longer and up to 30 days in some rare cases. This is out of our control unfortunately!)
