Jewelry Care, Maintenance & Repair:  Antique and vintage jewelry have been previously worn, possibly for many, many years.   Much of the construction of antique jewelry are more delicate than modern jewels, so special care needs to be given with these pieces.  You should always remove your jewelry when you:  wash your hands, take baths, exercise/vigorous activities, gardening, and before you hit the hay.  It is the buyers responsibility to care for your jewels after you have received them, this includes maintenance and possible future repairs with your own jeweler.
Please Note:  While I have had over 20 years experience with jewelry research and collecting, I am by no means a gemologist or certified jewelry historian.  All of my descriptions are, to the best of my ability, accurate and thorough.  All stones/diamonds have been measured with mm caliper tool/gauges.  These are estimations and should be taken as such.  The only way to truly measure gem weight, is by removing the stone from it's setting.  Please be aware of this.  Also, gemstones throughout the ages have been modified by heating treatments, I cannot verify with certainty if any specific jewels have had heat treatment.

2111,1960s red metal vintage desk lamp: rewired,"
            You are looking at a great vintage desk lamp, dating from the 1960s. 
It is 15 inches tall and the shade is 6.5 inches in diameter. 
I have had it professionally rewired and PAT tested. 
There are a couple of small scratches to the shade, as you might expect from a lamp of this age. But it is otherwise in great condition and retains its cool retro look. 
As always, please do get in touch if you have any questions. 
Many thanks!        ",59.70,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1960s

4682,Vintage Wembley SKinny Tie - Black & Blue Crossweave,"
            White squiggles punctuated with metallic silver dots are woven in to the crisscross pattern of this vintage skinny tie, highlighted by a subtle shadow effect that embroidery could never achieve...so cool. The black and pale-blue palette is classic and versatile, wearable ""With a Blue or Grey Suit"" (as the Wembley tag helpfully suggests) or with jeans. The tag doesn't list content, but the texture is very silky and soft. The seam at the tip is very slightly offset (see photo #5), but this tie is in fantastic vintage condition otherwise, with no stains, holes or tears.
2 1/2""W at the widest point, 55 1/2""L.

This beautiful and original mousepad is commercial quality, but it’s made by hand.
The lovely watercolor artwork is courtesy of Irene from BOOKPRINTSS shop.
You can buy original printable design at the link:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/264833909/elephant-poster-animal-art-printable
The design features an elephant on vintage dictionary page background. The mousepad is 100% handmade; it is not made by heat transferring onto a pre-made pad that is purchased wholesale which is a common technique in this type of product. Instead I use a superior full-color printing process to achieve a greater resolution and clarity than the soft top pads and a longer lasting product.
Buy this mousepad for your home or office and be inspired by the great original design every time you use your computer!
It has a hard top with black foam backing and measures 23 x 18 cm (approx. 9 x 7 inches) and is 5 mm thick (approx. 1/5 inch) with rounded corners.

Why does the color look different on my monitor than the actual product?
The reason for this is not only that every monitor is different, every browser is different, and color created from light (your monitor) looks different from color created from ink (a printer). We do our very best to capture the colors as accurately as possible.

Dress your phone with a little piece of art. Printed on light weight shatter proof, hard plastic moulded to the shape of the phone with a course matte finish, this slim line case clips snugly onto your phone like a will fitted dressed or neatly tailored suit. A durable case which provides full body coverage and protects your phone from dirt, scratches and knocks.
This phone case design is a detailed photo of part of a silk screen print on paper which I created, designed, made the silk screens and printed the original myself on my wooden silk screen press I built. The design is based on a series of women's heads I sketched with big hair and big eyes which I called my ancient alien heads design. I have also printed this design on pashminas and have digital prints on canvas and quality paper here in my shop.
About the case
*All over design covers back and sides of phone
*Snap case and designed to clip onto the back of your phone
*Durable but slim and light weight
*Bright vivid colours
*Matt finish very tactile
*Easy access to all buttons and ports
*Design title: Exposure

Please see the drop down menu for all the different phone cases available. The phone case in the photos is an iPhone 6 or 6s (I have this phone, iPhone 6s, so have used it to created the photos). The crop of the image will vary slightly depending on the phone case as each case will have slight (very small) variations because of their differing dimensions.
I do my best to reflect the actual color in the photos however, computer monitors vary so colors may show slight variations in person.

""When Calls the Controller!"" Part 1 of 2. Story by Jim Shooter. Art by George Tuska and Jack Abel.
Iron Man drops the Blood Brothers off at Ryker's Island. Controller breaks free from the loosened rubble and Scrounger follows. Iron Man returns to Stark International to find it on fire, passing Harry Key disguised as a security guard. Iron Man helps firefighters douse the blaze as Key is intercepted by Detective O'Brien. Stark repairs his armor and is contacted by the Beast, who confirms that the Controller vanished while fighting Captain Marvel from the same address that Iron Man & Daredevil fought the Blood Brothers. Iron Man investigates and finds a looted electronics store with evidence of the Controller's discs on a victim. He goes to an abandoned warehouse where the Controller used to work and finds the stolen equipment and a truck full of victims under the Controller's power. Controller attacks and Iron Man defeats him, but Scrounger begins production on more discs.

This is the cutest, most perfect little gift for any flower girl. I ordered this in a 4-5yr size with a coral flower and a customized note and could not be happier with the seller, the cost, the time it took to get here, or the product itself. It was such a smooth and simple transaction. Thank you so much for making such a sweet little gift for a special someone who will be leading the way for us in just a few short months. Highly recommend!

14497,Amazing Handmade Leather Thimbles (set of 2),"
            Soft, comfortable, protective leather thimble conforms to the shape of your finger for easier sewing! You HAVE to try this if you have a medical condition which causes circulation problems or sensitive fingertips. Also perfect if you frequently sew, are a quilter, professional framer (for sewing down projects such as needlework, jerseys, shirts, etc...) Great if you just need something to protect your fingertips while working with sharp objects. You will love this and want more than one thimble on hand. (I have even forgotten that I was wearing mine at work and have worn it half the day!)
Heavyweight leather is hand cut and sewn with heavy duty thread. No bulky protruding side seams to hinder fingers! Available in XS, S, M, L and XL sizes. Thumb sizes as well.(custom sizes available- Measure the circumference of your finger ABOVE the knuckle for sizing.) Thimble should be snug at first because it will stretch to mold to your finger size.
PLEASE BE SURE TO SPECIFY SIZE WHEN ORDERING!!!!
Here are the directions for determining sizing:
 Measure the circumference of your finger ABOVE the knuckle for sizing. Take a piece of string/yarn and wrap it (not too tightly) AROUND your finger ABOVE your middle knuckle to find the circumference and measure the string. It should be between 2 and 2 3/4 inches long. (2 would be SMALL, 2 1/4 MED, 2 1/2 LARGE) I can also make X-SMALL and X-LARGE if needed! Thimble should be snug at first because it will stretch to mold to your finger size.
Please contact me for special requirements or custom sizing. Also sold individually.        ",10.99,4.6429,"Handmade Supply

            A one of a kind steampunk neck corset or shoulder armour jewelry that is feminine yet fierce! It features rusted thorns and wire mesh roses, no one is going to mess with you wearing this baby! 
'Thorn' is a play on the idea of what we think of as 'floral' or 'feminine' and instead celebrates the rose thorns, and the strength of women.
This piece would make a perfect decorative ladies pauldron for an amazing costume. Beware though, although this will make you look like a bad mama jama, it is purely decorative and unlikely to deflect melee attacks. 
I created this originally for a jewelry competition in a floral category - but me being me - I really wanted to push the boundaries with what is considered floral, and what is considered jewelry. Two of my points of inspiration for this piece were the dark queen in the movie 'Mirror Mask' and the costumes in Mad Max.
The neck corset was designed for comfort, so I have not made it too thick as to choke the neck. It is boned and lined on the back, so you wont see any of the stitching for the beadwork. It has rusted found objects, thorns that have been treated with rust paint and sealed, and many wire mesh roses along the black vine that swirls around the design.
This piece is part of the Rust and Ruin Collection
Features:
- Handmade one of a kind design and beadwork, hundreds of hand sewn beads
- Comfortable design and adjustable 
- Boning included to keep the shape around the neck
- Lined on the back
- Hundreds of hours of beadwork
- Comes in a beautifully packaged jewelled gift box
- Ready to ship
*Please note that due to the elements used in the piece, it should not be washed, only spot cleaned.
