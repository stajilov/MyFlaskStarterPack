Notes:
I try my best to give the most accurate descriptions of my items. Some of the vintage items I come across are items I don't know anything about other than what the previous owners or others have told me. I try to research them before I list, but sometimes I just have to give my best guess regarding brand and age. I take lots of angles with photos to show the product the best I can. 
Please don't hesitate to message me for more info or more photos before purchasing.        ",20.00,4.8052,"Vintage item from the 1960s

858,"Vintage SIGNED Miriam Haskell Pearl Jewelry Set, Demi Parure, Miriam Haskell Vintage Jewelry, Estate Jewelry, Antique Jewelry Set, C1960s","
            This stunning demi parure set was made by jewelry designer, Miriam Haskell, C1960's. 
*Necklace - Condition: Good
The necklace features 12mm blueish-gray faux glass pearls with small glass spacer beads between each pearl. The clasp is a ""J"" hook adorned with a small blue beaded flower. The necklace is classified as in ""good"" condition as there is some discoloration in the pearls, and several have some slight peeling, although that is difficult to see. I used a magnifying glass. Also noted, there is one spacer bead missing, but is not overly apparent, see last photo. There is patina commensurate with age and the Miriam Haskell signature mark is noted on the ""J"" hook. Still a lovely piece in good wearable condition and have priced it accordingly. It measures 15"" in length with a 3"" beaded extender. 
*Bracelet - Condition: Very Good
The bracelet features a double strand of both 8mm and 10mm blueish-gray faux glass pearls with small glass spacer beads between each pearl. It is finished with a box clasp beautifully detailed with a large gold gilt flower motif featuring a large blueish-gray baroque pearl, violet-blue rhinestones and opaque blue glass beads. The Miriam Haskell signature is noted as the cartouche design. It is classified as in ""very good"" condition as there is some slight discoloration between each pearl and some very slight patina at the clasp. It measures 7"" in length.
*Brooch - Condition: Excellent
The brooch is done in a crescent moon shape beautifully detailed with a stunning 20mm blueish-gray baroque pearl, violet-blue rhinestones and opaque blue glass beads creating a burst of flowers surrounded with gold gilt leaves. It is classified as in ""excellent"" condition. The c-clasp closure is in working condition and the Miriam Haskell signature is noted on the back in an oval plaque. It measures 2"" long by 2"" wide at its widest point. It is a show stopper!
*Earrings - Condition: Very Good
The earrings are detailed with a large gold gilt flower motif featuring a large blueish-gray baroque pearl, violet-blue rhinestones and opaque blue glass beads. They are classified as in ""very good"" condition. The clip tension in both earrings works with no issues. They do have some light patina commensurate with age. The Miriam Haskell signature is noted on the back of both clips. They measure 1 1/8"" tall by 1 1/8"" wide at the widest point.
Miriam Haskell jewelry is well known for its intricate details and hand wired workmanship and continues to be highly sought after and very collectible. Her jewelry was well known and worn by the women of society of her time and some of her well known customers were Joan Crawford, Lucille Ball and the Dutches of Windsor to name a few. 
Russian gold plating also known as RGP, is a rich looking gold plating that was used extensively by the Miriam Haskell jewelry line. The gold plated dipping solution contained 24-kt gold, among other (secret) ingredients. (Source: Miriam Haskell Jewelry by Cathy Gordon & Sheila Pamfiloff).

1848,1948 Vintage Africa map French map Antique Africa map Old map of Africa antique map of Africa Geography decor French dictionary plate Londez,"
            Here is a brightly colored antique Africa map from 1948. This old map of Africa was rescued from a damaged 1948 French Larousse dictionary. It shows the borders of African countries mid-20th century. The reverse shows other maps of Africa with details of the main surface communication networks (roads, rivers, air routes) as they were at the time over the continent.
This lovely vintage map of Africa would look lovely framed or you could use them for your own collage or scrap booking projects. It would make a great gift for a geography decor.

1871,1937 Vintage Map of Montana - Old Montana Map,"
            This is a vintage map of Montana, published in 1937. It is printed on paper with a nice, matte feel. The printing is very fine. Overall, quite a pretty map!
The full map is shown in the last photo. Other photos show details from the map. Note that the background may appear to be white in the photos; it is actually an off-white background.

1994,"1940s UNSILVERED PURPLE Stripes Glass Christmas Ornament, Rare Wartime Ornament, Vintage USA Unsilvered Ornaments, Vintage Purple Ornaments","
            Wonderful American made unsilvered wartime Christmas ornament In rare pastel colors! Circa 1941-1945.
This is a hard to find vintage USA WWII blown glass ornament featuring a lovely transparent purple glass painted with four colorful stripes. White is the thickest, then turquoise, yellow, and pink. It measures 2 inches wide and retains its original scalloped metal cap which is stamped, ""Made in U.S.A."" Both the glass and cap are in excellent condition. There are a couple of yellow paint smears, and the cap is oxidized. This vintage glass ornament was made by Corning, one of the early American Christmas ornament manufacturers. 
This is a wonderful 1940s USA unsilvered round striped purple glass Christmas ornament, a great addition to any war era ornament collection.
SIDE NOTE: Metallic mercury glass ornaments get their shine from being coated on their interior with a silver nitrate solution. In 1941, WWII wartime shortages restricted this material, and ornaments during this time frame were produced without silvering. Since unsilvered ornaments were less popular than the shiny mercury glass, they are harder to find and thus more collectible.

3390,Vintage Marc Jacobs Wallet - Red Leather Wallet - Silver Metal Snap Front - Damaged Kiss Lock Does Not Close - Debit Cards - Currency - Chic,"
            Vintage Marc Jacobs - Red Leather Wallet - Silver Metal Snap Front - Currency Section - Damaged Kiss Lock - Does Not Close - Clean - Chic - Authentic
This is a vintage red leather designer Marc Jacobs authentic wallet.   Clean condition showing signs of wear and use.  The kiss lock clasp is broken.  The change purse portion of this wallet is in disrepair.  Perhaps it could be repaired....but the change purse does not stay closed on its own due to the missing/broken half of the kiss lock closure.  The metal frame is in good condition but the change purse does not stay closed.
I have used a larger sized hair tie to hold the change purse closed and it works well actually....with minimal visibility on the hair tie.  Then the change purse stays closed and can hold coins safely.
Otherwise, in vintage good condition showing signs of age and wear.  No missed stitches or unraveling.  The red leather is clean; it has patina on the outside and shows some ink marks on the inside.  The inside of the change purse is creamy suede.  Beautiful detailing. 
Not too shabby for its vintage age and intended use.  Still has lots of high fashion designer wear left to give.  List price adjusted to account for less than perfect condition.
It weighs 6 ounces prior to packaging for safe transit.  It measures approx. 4"" by 4"" when clasped and opens to a full 9"".  The currency section measures 7-1/4"" long. The wallet is approx. 1-1/2"" thick.   
The inside has two distinct sections....one for 6 card storage and another two-tiered section for paper currency or receipts.  All sections are nicely lined and appear in clean condition with some ink pen marks here and there....nothing terribly unsightly.
The red leather feels marvelous, the front clasp works as designed and this vintage wallet has a nice weight to it.  
There is a silver metal tab on the inside, etched ""Marc Jacobs Made in Italy"".  Clean condition; vintage designer goodness.
Suitable for upcycling into a new keepsake.  Suitable for practical use before and after repair to the kiss lock frame.  
Nice little wallet to store cards and paper keepsakes that aren't used on a daily basis.  
Clean and well kept.  Enjoy!

3461,Baby Dresses Handmade Vintage,"
            Vintage lot of two handmade baby dresses.  One is a regular size baby dress with lots of fine embroidery and short sleeves.  The other is a long christening dress  with long sleeves and lots of embroidery and a sleeveless slip.  Both dresses have French seams and are mostly hand sewn with very few machine stitches.  They have a few small moth holes which is to be expected given their age and a couple of small spots which could possibly be caused from long storage.   Both have beautifully executed hand embroidery and cutwork reminiscent of vintage European work.        ",20.00,4.8947,"Vintage item from the 1930s

3884,"Vintage Wheel of Life Art Print of Tibetan Buddhist Thangka Painting, 22x30inches","
            This vintage Tibetan Buddhist  Wheel of Life Thangka (Tangka, Tonka) painting art print  beautifully details the Buddhist philosophy of rebirth.
Size: 22""inches x 30"" inches
 This art print has four color separations and is on the finest quality coated art paper.  It was printed  in Washington, D.C..back in 1988 to promote the Dalai Lama's up and coming visit to the States.
To navigate through the wheel of life, a full page explanation accompanies the art print which is packaged in a postal tube. 
The last image showing the art print framed was taken by one of my customers who was kind enough to take the time to send me this image of how she framed her Wheel of Life art print. 
It would make a great gift for any Buddhist friend...And for a college graduation, what could be more appropriate.
  For international orders, please email the Old Silk Route for specific postage rates to your country.

3902,1930 Carl Zeiss Jenna Tessar F4.5 15cm View Camera Lena,"
            I am pleased to offer to the Etsy  Community an excellent 1930 Carl Zeiss View Camera Lens. This is a F/4.5 15cc lens that some would consider to be one of the finest Tessar lenses ever made. Tessar formula lenses were invented by Carl Zeiss and provided a remarkable jump in optical quality enabling highly improved available light photography and may be considered similar to the development of coated lenses vs non-coated lens. This lens despite being over 80 years may still be used with a viewfinder camera or any optical device.The lens has a 32mm screw thread. It may be adapted to fit literally any view camera with an inexpensive adapter. Please view the pictures and email me if you have any questions about this remarkable piece of optical glass.

            Vintage Military Shoulder Bag, Army Canvas Messenger Bag, Green Light Canvas Army Bag, Cross Body Bag, Unisex Military Haversack
***********************************************
This genuine unused military shoulder bag is made from light canvas in army green shade. The shoulder strap is adjustable and wider on the shoulder for comfortable wearing. The bag has two inside compartments, a strap for under flap fastening, with a D-ring attached, wide flap with thick cow leather loops in a nice brown shade. It fastens with two canvas straps with metallic buckle. All loose straps have metallic tips painted in dark military green to match the rest of the shoulder bag. 
If you want a bag with stamps please take a look at this article: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/238182604/vintage-military-shoulder-bag-army?ref=shop_home_listings
 and send me a note to seller on purchase. But please take into consideration that the canvas of these two listings is very different. The one listed here is not so heavy like the one in the other listing of which I have more than just one piece. 
This type of military shoulder bag was typically used in the Communist era by the infantry of the Romanian army. My father still remembers them from the time when he had to do his military duty on the Black Sea Coast. 
This authentic Romanian Army item can be carried cross-body and is ideal for daily use. You can use the bag for your iPad, books, notebooks and other stuff you carry with you every day. The small compartment can hold a compact camera, your phone or even a small bottle. The shoulder bag is very versatile, unisex and just looks fabulous fashionable for its age. The bag is also a perfect gift for him, for the traveler, for the person who loves hiking, camping, and fishing. 
*********************************************
CONDITION: Good vintage condition. This is an unused vintage military bag, it was deposited for long years so there may be a tiny scent that I find negligible and that will go away with time. If you want your bag to smell like new you can wash it when you receive it. Being made of fabric it is really easy to wash, I would recommend you to wash it by hand to preserve the colors better. Some of the metal parts may be bit rusty but this just adds to the vintage character of the item. 
DIMENSIONS: 
Bag: 32 x 32 x 12 cm / 12.5 x 12.5 x 5 inches
Strap: 55 cm / 21.5 inches 
*********************************************
For better viewing of the messenger bag please enlarge the pictures on the zoom button right under the main image. All photos are of the actual vintage messenger bag listed. If you need more pictures please don't hesitate to contact me.

Store in a cool place, if it gets too hot it may get soft.  If that happens just pop it in the refrigerator for a bit until it hardens up again.
Dogs can have theirs scented with lavender essential oils if you wish, message me at check out.
Cats must have unscented as essential oils can be dangerous for them.

PERSONAL NOTE:  I've used this soap for a long time now.  My first dog I used it on, Sophie (RIP), had severe allergies and constantly scratched!  She would bite her paws until they were raw.  Even with a change in food, the scratching continued.  Until I formulated this special bar of soap!  It was simply amazing!!  No more scratching!!  Her coat was gorgeous and her skin moisturized.  The change in Sophie put a smile on my face!  Not to mention the relief she must have felt!!!
My current pup, Mr. Bolo, began scratching immediately after I got him home.  Straight to the sink he went!!  After 2 baths with this soap, the scratching stopped.  Yes, Mr. Bolo is now 'scratch free'!!

Each handmade bird is sewn from upcycled wool (or wool blend) sweaters. The beaks are eco-felt (made from recycled water bottles) and they are stuffed with eco-fiber. They also contain 1 teaspoon of certified organic catnip. The eyes are needle felted wool. Each bird measures ~4"" tall.

            This beautiful layered keychain is the perfect way to remember your beloved pet or makes a thoughtful gift for someone who has lost their best friend.
I start with a brushed aluminum 1"" heart stamped with pet' name and a tiny pawprint.  This is layered upon a 1.25"" disc of bronze stamped with the words ""Once by my side"".  A 1.5"" weathered copper disc completes this tribute with the words, ""Forever in my heart (heart shape).  (Please note:  Layer metals may be switched due to availability.

6467,"Firefighter Baby Bib and Personalized matching Burp cloth, Tan baby shower gift, New baby Gift Tan","
            Do you know a little future Firefighter?  Then this will be perfect for him or her!!!  This makes a perfect baby shower gift!
MATERIALS
This bib is made from new cotton rip stop material.  This material looks just like the firefighter turnout material. I choose to use new material on all my items as I don't know what toxins can still be left on the material even after washing it. Also this eliminates the smoke smell that is left on the material.   The bib has a snap closer.  
The burp cloth also has the new cotton rip stop and reflective tape add to it.  The burp cloth is a cotton Gerber burp cloth.
SIZE
Bib size: 7.5"" wide 
5.5"" tall main bib
11"" tall total bib
Burp cloth size
19"" tall
13.5"" wide
HOW TO ORDER THIS ITEM
Use the drop down selections above to choose what color thread  you would like the name stitched in . 
Next choose the reflective tape color you prefer.
Last in the notes to seller section at checkout state the name you would like. Please use capital letters as this will insure correct spelling and show you how your item will look once completed.

Your body and hands stay soft!! I love it!! I also love the scent. I am extremely allergic to perfumes and the minty smell is refreshing! I will be a life long customer! Thank You!""
""What I love most about Essential Mint Body Butter is the fragrant mint smell, the smooth consistency of the butter and that is made by a special process. Each person that I have gifted or tried this body butter has raved about its amazing qualities. My Aunt noted that she put the body butter on stiff areas of her body and the soothing mint help to release the tension and increase her ability in those areas. An amazing product and definitely one that continues to moisturize and give my skin the perfect glow!""

------ABOUT OUR FRAGRANCES-------
We are Essentially MINT and we love using all different types of mint when making our products. 
We have four fragrances you can choose from. 
Peppermint- Invigorating to the body and spirit while at the same time encouraging a sense of peace and tranquility. The refreshing aroma is great to give you that little extra boost. Bring a little bit of the spa to your everyday routine. 
Spearmint- Also very refreshing to the body while have a bit more of a mild scent than peppermint. The aroma is cool and calming. 
Lavender-Peppermint- The combination of lavender and peppermint is simply fantastic. Lavender is a very calming scent that is floral and fresh and clean. When combined with the invigorating scent of peppermint it is sublime. 
Lemony Sensations- A zesty mixture of three fragrances; lemon, lemonbalm, and lemon grass. (Yes Lemonbalm is a mint!) This combination fragrance is revitalizing. It is uplifting and fresh.        ",20.00,4.8588,"Handmade item

Velour towels are softer than terry towels. For Velour towels, the top part of the each loop is shaved allowing a softer feel. Terry towels have hoops on both sides of the towel so it is more abrasive. Again, our towels are velour.

This is an imported towel for Kute Kiddo.

            One of the very first little pillows that The Decorated Room™ made when we first opened up shop. We took a break from it, but now we are ready to add it back to our store! How exciting, right?
What an adorable way to keep track of those baby teeth! Im sure the tooth fairy will be very impressed when she picks up the tooth! She won't have a hard time knowing which tooth she is taking because you can color in the tooth as they come out.
Customized with your child's name, you can write down the date when the tooth comes out and also color in the tooth to keep track of what baby teeth is left just by using a sharpie. In the back is a pocket where the Tooth fairy can leave the dough and a note!
This Mini Love Pillow™-Tooth Chart/Tooth Fairy Pillow:
Measures 7 x 7 made out of Linen and our premium cotton. 
Has a tooth chart in the front where you can color in each tooth as they fall out and write on the line what date it happened.
A striped cotton pocket is also in the back to hold the tooth and a note and for the tooth fairy to leave some money or a little prize.
Name is printed directly onto the pillow (not hand written or heat transferred). And it shows the upper and lower teeth in the tooth chart. The middle part can be customized as well, if you want a saying or a nickname. The choice is yours. Just let us know in the notes section.
A string can be attached as well if you would like it added on. It would be a twine string. 
We can also swap the fabric out to the main pillow be white cotton and the tooth chart be printed on linen. Just let us know in the notes.
Please put in the notes what name you would like on the tooth fairy pillow as well.
**We suggest using a pencil or a graphite pencil to fill in the tooth as that is what we find works best. Also using a pen will work as well.
There are many tooth chart pillows like this one (As the tooth chart is standard chart from the dental association, but this is a TDR's Original design with having the name printed on (versus writing it in ink yourself)  as well as having the upper and lower teeth printed on the chart.

*************************************************************
Here at Aroma Healing we believe that it is always best to seek out natural solutions wherever possible. Our brand of 100% natural bath and beauty products have been created using high quality pure essential oils and base ingredients. 
Natural alternatives are becoming more and more popular everyday as people start to see that the permanent positive results that can be achieved are far superior to the temporary fix and possible side effects often associated with the conventional choices available. Our aim is to help you to achieve this ethos by using one of nature’s most abundant natural resources, essential oils. The versatility of these powerful oils is endless and at Aroma Healing we strive to add to our product base continually, increasing our range and the options available to you in order to help you enhance your health and your mood and therefore the quality of your life.
Many products sold commercially claim to be 'natural' but very few are genuinely 100% natural when you take a closer look. Aroma Healing products are raising this benchmark with all of the ingredients being 100% from nature, no expense or effort spared, with organic ingredients used where possible.
Each item is handmade to order to ensure optimum freshness and quality for you.

I select, cut and sand each piece of wood. Each piece is different with its own knots, rings and other “imperfections”; therefore, every piece is unique.
The wood is stained, each nail is hammered individually, and the string is put on by hand. Some nails might not be completely straight or evenly spaced and the wood underneath will slightly show through in some places.

{{{REQUIRED CUSTOM ORDER INFORMATION}}}
Please provide the following information in the ""Note to Art of Words Boutique"" box on the payment screen that appears after you select the dimensions and orientation you'd like, then click Add to Cart. You can also message me through Etsy before you purchase to discuss the details or email me at  artofwordsboutique [!at] gmail.com. Please provide your email if you are not sure how the Etsy messengers work and I will contact you that way. 
-- 1. YOUR FULL QUOTE.--
- Please provide the quote EXACTLY how you’d like it with exact punctuation and capitalization that you’d like. If you want all cursive, I do not recommend capitalizing all letters. It doesn't flow together well.
--2. BACKGROUND.--
Backgrounds can be (examples in links provided):
• SOLID ACRYLIC: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/235604884/she-believed-she-could-so-she-did-canvas?ref=shop_home_feat_4
• STRIPES (combination of two colors): 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/510211609/lets-stay-home-canvas-quote-art-home?ref=shop_home_active_5
• COLOR PALETTE with 3-5 acrylic colors: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/239758030/be-brave-color-palette-color-swatch?ref=shop_home_active_65
• WATERCOLOR WASH with 1 color: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/232154090/go-into-the-world-and-do-well-go-into?ref=shop_home_active_63
• WATERCOLOR CIRCLE with 1-2 colors (Darker areas will vary canvas to canvas, as it completely depends on how the watercolor settles and dries): 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/508387999/she-needed-a-hero-so-thats-what-she?ref=shop_home_active_10
 
• BLENDED WATERCOLOR with 2-3 colors: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/234667448/the-darkest-nights-produce-the-brightest?ref=shop_home_active_37
If you have other ideas for backgrounds, please let me know! I can also look like any of my listings, too!
I can do practically any color. 
--3.LETTERING COLOR.--
Black, rose gold, gold, or silver ink. White ink can be used on dark, solid backgrounds ONLY. It is not as completely opaque as others and tends to look more like chalk. I recommend sticking with black, rose gold, gold, or silver due to this. Watercolor can be used on a white background only (see my Live in the Sunshine canvas for an example of watercolor lettering). 
--4. WRITING STYLE.--
All cursive, or combination of cursive and print (see my listings for examples). I do not recommend all print because all print tends to leave the canvas looking very empty. 
• • • Example • • • 
1. I love you and I like you.
2. Black solid acrylic background
3. Silver lettering
4. All cursive
You don't have to worry about the format/layout the words unless you have something specific in mind! I can handle that. :) If you DO have a specific layout in mind, please let me know. Due to the handmade nature, I can only fit so much across and down but I'm happy to work with any ideas you might have!
{{{Important Information}}}
*Due to the handwritten nature of my work, the following are my word limits for each size. You may go over 1-2 words on the smaller sizes and 5 or so for the larger sizes, but at the limit, the canvas is covered and it may be difficult to read if you go over the limit.
8x10 - 10 words
9x12 - 15 words
11x14 - 25 words
12x12- 25 words
12x16 - 35 words
16x20 - 40 words
18x24 - 55 words
-- International Customers Outside the US - please contact me before purchasing 18x24 or larger. These sizes have a substantially higher shipping cost. I have no way of accounting for that with my shipping settings with how Etsy is set up. Failure to contact me before purchasing one of these larger sizes will lead to your order being canceled and refunded.  --

8906,"Natural Remineralizing Toothpaste, 8oz || remineralizing, calcium, magnesium, coral calcium, herbal, natural, coconut oil, xylitol","
            Enjoy an unrivaled feeling of clean! You'll have polished teeth, fresh breath, and whiter teeth within the first few uses. Natural minerals and botanical oils scrub away plaque and stains, and anti-bacterial herbs remove built up plaque and biofilm.
User reports: 
A large reduction in plaque and mucous, fresh breath, and translucent tips filling back in. Others also found relief from hot and cold sensitivity that wasn't well controlled with OTC sensitive toothpaste formulas.
Why this formula was created: 
Shortly after birthing my third child, I had pain in almost every tooth. Upon researching tooth pain, I learned that I had experienced a serious demineralization, also known as enamel loss. I had heat and cold sensitivity, pain in several developing cavities, and a cracked molar that went down to the root. I could wiggle each molar half independently of each other, and the exposed nerve made me jump any time food touched it. Chewing on the side of my mouth with the cracked molar was impossible, and enjoying coffee or ice cream was definitely out of the question.
I researched how to fix my problem as I desperately imagined the massive dental bill, and came across mineralizing toothpastes. I was just getting started in the natural healing and herbal world and tried several recipes. Baking soda was really disgusting, clay made me gag. I questioned why I would need baking soda as it is very abrasive (and salty), or clay, which pulls out instead of depositing? Determined, I continued on experimenting and eventually wound up with this wonderful recipe.
My results: Sensitivity and pain, gone. Healthier teeth. Whiter teeth. Cleaner teeth. Fresh breath.
Contains NO: parabens, sulfates, flouride, salts, clays, nor baking soda. It will not clog your drains as some clays can.
Ingredients: Coral calcium, calcium magnesium carbonate, diatomaceous earth, xylitol, coconut oil, olive oil, distilled water, burdock root, oregon grape root, plantain leaf/stem, echinacea extract,  xantham gum, potassium sorbate,{lemon essential oil, orange essential oil, rosemary essential oil, red thyme essential oil for Lemon Thyme flavor} OR {peppermint essential oil, sage essential oil for Sage Peppermint flavor}
Suggested Use: Squeeze a pea sized amount onto toothbrush, scrub teeth, gums, and tongue. Rinsing is optional, it is completely safe to swallow - great for children and people with special needs who can't spit well.        ",12.95,4.8594,"Handmade item

9120,Around the Sun and Seasons Work--Montessori Celebration of Life--Montessori Birthday Celebration,"
            Living in Arizona, we do not get to experience the change of seasons, it is summer pretty much year round. So I love anything that helps my children visualize how beautiful seasons are!
 This set does it all! It includes a felt mat with removable seasonal trees and the sun, labels for months and seasons as well as 3 laminated cards on colored cardstock per season. Colors of details on felt seasonal trees may vary from photos above depending on availability.
 It can be used for traditional Montessori birthday celebrations with a candle placed in the center of the sun. The birthday child is invited to stand in front of the month they were born in holding a globe (optional) and to walk around the sun back to their month symbolizing the number of years they've lived. Lovely way to incorporate science in a birthday celebration. Doubles as seasons work with sorting activity.
Cards are cut prior to laminating and then cut again after to insure complete seal around each piece, corners are rounded for safety. They are classroom sturdy, completely waterproof, will not split or peel.

Check out our website http://www.handspinner.info is now live!  Pictures, videos, how-tos and more! 
Before ordering PLEASE READ this information ( https://goo.gl/BtF3bO ) about differences between bearings used in our spinners
Keeps your fingers agile and busy, improves concentration and simply fun to spin really fast!  
Spinner comes with either steel or ceramic hybrid central bearing (as seen on pictures) and 3 more regular bearings on the outside. 
Ceramic hybrid spins longer than steel. 
Premium ceramic hybrid spins for up to 2 minutes (1:30 - 2:00)!  That's as long as full ceramic one!
Here's a video comparison between different bearing types:
https://youtu.be/cbBWZ_TGhEo
Easy to hold with two fingers with included removable finger caps.
Body of the spinner is laser cut from 1/4"" (6mm) black acrylic and bearings are tension fitted.  
On top (from one side only) there's another thin piece of either faux brushed gold or faux brushed silver acrylic glued to the base.
While there's no actual precious metals in the finish layer, it looks just like the real thing!
Matching laser cut finger caps ARE ALWAYS INCLUDED with with spinner. 
NEW! Request custom engraving (in the area around central bearing) for 5. Just add engraving service item (https://www.etsy.com/listing/514797393/) to your shopping cart when checking out, and specify text.
New Improved Design (V2):
-----------------------------------
If you are familiar with our LD Spinner series, you might notice that these spinner has new and improved shape. It's now has thicker bezel edge to make it tougher and harder to break. You still should not drop it on hard surface, as it might crack.
-----------------------------------
Please note: Finger caps and axle ship disassembled (so shipping cost can remain low).  It take less than one minute to put it together :)
Recently we simplified assembly process, so if you don't see washers in your package, all you have to do it insert dowel into one cap, insert into central bearing and then close with second cap! Push them hard so they are secure.

            This manual hand crank music box brings back all the nostalgia of childhood. Slowly turn the handle to hear and 18 note melody. A piece of fossil glass has been attached with a plant preserved right inside the glass. Choose from one of 12 available tunes, listed below.
What a perfect gift for that little girl in your life, or even for yourself. What makes this collectible music box even more special is the fossil glass jewelry on the top, transparent just like the music box. The deep aqua colour is especially beautiful.
Spend time listening to the sound of the notes the music box plays and re-live the happy memories from your childhood.
Song choices:
Disney Frozen Let it Go
Somewhere Over the Rainbow
You are my Sunshine
Love Story
Happy Birthday
Edelweiss
Twinkle Little Star
Canon in D
Fur Elise
La vie en Rose
Amazing Grace
Lullaby
** Indicate your song choice in a message to seller when you check out.
Size and attachment: 
The music box is made from acrylic and has a mechanical crank that plays 18 notes when slowly turned. 
The music box portion measures 8cm x 5cm x 3cm. The inside mechanisms are made of metal. 
The fossil glass portion measures 1.75 inches x 1.5 inches and is 1/4 inch thickness.
What is this fossil glass attachment?
The piece of deep aqua botanical fossil glass contains a plant that has been turned to carbon between layers of glass. A tiny piece of nature preserved forever! Eco friendly! Also a nice gift for the plant lover or scientist! I make all the fossil glass in my small home studio, and the plants I use are taken from my own property without harming the larger plant. 
The plant is burned away in a special oven at almost 1500 degrees! What you see is the ash remains, sealed within the glass as it melts around the plant.
Thank you for stopping by my shop!        ",20.00,4.88,"Handmade item

10436,YOUR Soprano Ukulele Handpainted with Cherry Blossoms (Ukulele not included),"
            PLEASE READ THIS LISTING CAREFULLY
THIS LISTING IS FOR PAINTING SERVICES ONLY on a soprano ukulele or small instrument that you provide. Prices vary based on design and size of instrument.
Custom hand painted pink cherry blossoms, stems, leaves and buds on YOUR SOPRANO sized (or smaller) ukulele. If you have a larger ukulele or even a guitar, then please see my listing for concert  ukuleles.
https://www.etsy.com/listing/266153097/your-concert-or-tenor-ukulele?ref=shop_home_active_1
Send me your uke (or lets find one that you plan to purchase online) and I'll hand paint cherry blossoms on it, restring it and send it to you! I would rather hand paint a decent quality ukulele that you choose rather than offer a cheap one that you'll wind up replacing anyway. 
Keep in mind that the cherry blossom design works because so much of the background is untouched, so the sound will not be affected, but if you want a different design, we can figure it out.
Let me know if you'd like it personalized. I paint a name with a blossom on the back of the neck at no extra charge.
It's not a problem to do other kinds of blossoms in other colors. Please message me to discuss.
Any extra work you request will be figured into the design price.

This design was a top 10 finalist in The Craftys Decorative Painting category for 2015!
HOW IT WORKS:
1. Please don't order THIS listing. Send me a message to me to discuss your custom design.  [click on ask a question or request a custom order]. I've set the shipping high because I don't know where you want your uke shipped. If it costs less to ship (and most likely it will, especially on the east coast)  I will refund the difference to you or try to get a more accurate shipping price when I create your listing.
2. Once I know what you want, I will create a special private listing for you. (see #1.)
3. You send me your ukulele (I'm in New York). Make sure you insure it when you send it just to be safe.
4. I'll unstring it, paint your design, restring it with your existing strings, pack it super well and figure out the lowest cost and safest shipping options for you, including insurance and a tracking number.
Do you drink when you play music? Order a matching wine glass!

Will this be your first ukulele? There are quite a bit of choices out there right now, so I'll be happy to help steer you in the right direction.
Please feel free to ask any questions.
DISCLAIMER: The ukuleles in the photos have been sold. I am only offering hand painting services on whatever is shipped to me by you.

            Keep your camera secure in style with a monogram camera strap! 
Please leave in seller's note...
1. Camera Strap Color
2. Monogram Color
*if your preferred thread color is not listed, convo me with your request* 
3. Initials as they will appear (first, LAST, middle)
Camera strap pictured is pink quatrefoil with a royal monogram.
Because the monogram is small, some thread and strap colors disagree. If you are worried about a combination, shoot me a convo and I will be happy to give my recommendations! :) Also, for the same reason, the only monogram style available is the diamond. (Pictured)  
Not intended for smaller cameras.

10823,Raspberry Pi 2B or Pi 3 Zelda NES Nintendo Case with LED - Zelda Theme,"
            3D Printed Miniature Zelda Themed Nintendo Entertainment System Case for Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and Pi 3 with Green LED.
Made from tough, Eco-Friendly PLA material. This mini NES Raspberry Pi case is printed in Green and Gold and features a flip lid with the Zelda Wingcrest symbol, making the Pi's 4 USB and Ethernet ports easily accessible. The HDMI, Power, and Audio port cutouts are on the left side for simple connectivity. The micro sd card slot cutout is located in the back.
What makes our NES cases stand out are the custom features we designed ourselves. The micro SD card slot features a Hylian Shield engrave so you can remove the micro sd card much easier without having to take the case apart. The supports inside the case have been designed to fit both Pi versions so their chips don't sit on them. The slots on the top have been widened for added ventilation. Also included is an LED cutout and pre-wired (with resistor) Green LED already glued into place. I will include an easy wiring diagram for hooking the wires up to the proper GPIO pins, very simple and just slips on. The led will turn on when the power is on and off when power is off, just like a real Nintendo. Everything is 3D printed. The Wingcrest lid is 100% 3D printed and not a cheap sticker or decal. Even the LED lense insert that diffuses the LED light is 3D printed.
You will not find another NES case like this on Etsy, it is truly one of a kind.
This listing is for the Case Only. A Raspberry Pi is not included. The power wire in the photo is just to show the Green LED feature.

This decal comes in true RBG colors. Lots of shops claim ""Approved Colors"" but they're only close. Check reviews for pictures. True colors can only be achieved with a special printer that most people do not use. The result of this means I stay really busy which leads to a really long turn around time, but you won't be sorry when your logo shows up in true colors  :)

There will be a mark on both decals at the center point so you can line them up.
►►What’s your turn-around?
My turn around time varies between 2 and 3 weeks because I do hundreds of these a month. You will find that anyone who does these in TRUE consultant colors will have a similar wait time.
** If you need this item quickly, please add on this rush package. **

►►What can I put on this decal?
This decal features 2 lines of text - it can be your name, number, email, FB group, or anything else you wish. 
I have samples here.

►►Can I change the text color? 
You can! I have a picture listed with available choices, however, text needs to be the same color overall for this price.
If you want, for example, some white text, but your name in purple, you may upgrade to multi color, here.

Frequently asked questions:
►►Do you send proofs?
This decal does not get a proof unless requested.
►►Home Office Approval
I have personally sent my designs into the graphics department and this decal is approved. The logo  matches the RBG colors and uses approved fonts where noted.
If you have questions about compliance, feel free to message me and I can help you ensure your decal is following the rules.
►►Is this decal weatherproof? Can I use my rear wiper?
Decal is made out of weatherproof vinyl - the white portion will last 6-10 years, and the colored portion will last around 5 years. The color portion is printed on high quality with latex inks (no allergy risk!) and will not fade in a year like some printed logos.
You may use your wiper freely, but you need to let this decal cure for a week or so to ensure good adhesion.
►►Can this decal be removed?
You won’t be peeling it off after it cures, but a razor and rubbing alcohol will completely remove it, and any residue.
If you watch the videos and follow all directions yet still make a mistake when applying your decal, take a picture and contact me and I will replace the damaged letters FREE, you only pay shipping.
My customer service is what sets me apart from the rest, and you'll be hard pressed to find anyone else who offers live video help or free replacements :)        ",20.00,4.9319,"Handmade item

And now for the boring yet important stuff…
::: TSB FAQ :::
Please understand that handmade items take time to create. EVERY stamped and/or leather item is made completely from scratch when the order is placed. They are not mass produced items, but handmade to order for each customer. The necessary materials for your item are ordered at the time of purchase. Because of this, I am only able to accept minor alterations once the order has been placed and I cannot offer exchanges or refunds. Pre-made items ship within two business days of purchase and custom items generally ship within 7 business days, but can take longer during my busier periods, such as the holiday season. Current production times can be found in the Shop Announcement on the main store page. 
All items are sent out in a gift package, with a purchase receipt. If you are sending an item as a gift, please let me know at the time of purchase in the NOTES TO SELLER box and I will not include the receipt. 
By purchasing an item from my store, you are agreeing to my shop policies. Please make sure to read them to avoid any confusion. You can find them here: 
http://www.etsy.com/shop/thesadbasset/policy
All handstamped items are created one letter / symbol / design at a time. Shaping, sanding and assembly also adds one of a kind character to each piece. Each piece and its materials are unique and slight variations should be expected and not be seen as defective.

♥ About 14k Gold Filled:
Unlike gold-plated jewelry which has a thin layer of gold electroplated unto a surface of base metal and will eventually rub off and lose color after continuous wear, 14k GOLD FILLED jewelry has a much thicker layer of gold that is pressure bonded unto the piece resulting in a much more valuable piece that will not tarnish or lose its color.
♥ It will not flake, rub off, or change colors.
♥ Most people with jewelry sensitivities can wear gold fill without any issues.
♥ Most quality gold jewelry is made from the 14k gold fill.
Thank you for looking!

~ How to Measure for a Wedding Garter ~
Wrap a measuring tape around your thigh where you plan to wear your garters. Garters are typically worn about 4 inches above the knee. Look at the number where the measuring tape overlaps itself. This is the size of your thigh, which will guide you in knowing what size garter you'll need. Write it down if necessary. Thats the number I need and I will adjust accordingly.
~ Please also provide your wedding date.

            This is for two forks handstamped with ""MY ONE"" and ""MY ONLY"" along with the wedding date on the handle.  These are a perfect engagement gift which creates beautiful photo opportunities next to the wedding cake.  If you would like your wedding date on the handles please include in the notes section.  A beautiful keepsake to use on your wedding day and every anniversary.  A gift box is included with every order.
The silverware is vintage, meaning it had a previous life and will now have a new life with the bride and groom.  I search all over the country for beautiful pieces.  There may be signs of the previous life but that just adds to the story.
Each piece is handstamped one letter at a time so there will be variations in the alignment and depth of the impression.  The silverware patterns will vary depending on what I have in stock.  
All of the silverware is food safe.  Please hand wash.  With numerous washings, the darkening in the letters may fade, but the impression will always remain.        ",20.00,4.9667,"Handmade item

""Mr. & ""Mrs."" Stamped Antique Silver Plated Forks.
Perfect wedding, or shower gift! Featuring large unique 8mm font. 
This vintage, antique, rustic silver plated fork set is hand stamped by me using metal stamp letters! Great gift for the newly weds or husband and wife to be! 
I am also more than happy to make ""Mr."" and ""Mr"" or ""Mrs."" and ""Mrs."" sets as well! 
On this particular set, I was able to stamp heard on the bottom of the fork stems.
All my items are made with vintage silver plated flatware that I find at local antique and vintage thrift stores around town. I use metal stamps to hammer in each letter individually. 
Because I find each piece of silver plate on my own, you are not guaranteed to receive the same design as shown in the photos above. You may receive a matching pair of two, or a two different patterns that pair nicely together. Each piece is unique in itself, but I promise the piece you will receive will have an ornate pretty pattern on it's stem. 
Pair with a number of other Sweet Thyme Design garden markers to make a set to gift to a friend, or to treat yourself!

            Vintage silver plate fork set, hand stamped with saying of your choice. Please keep in mind the stamping space on a fork is limited so if you are concerned about saying length please contact me before ordering.
HOW TO ORDER:
1. Select quantity from the drop down menus on the listing.
2. If the option is available, choose whether you want the date or name(s) stamped on the handle or not from the drop down menu. (If you do leave the date in mm.dd.yyyy or mm.dd.yy format or name(s) in notes to TheRusticStamp section at checkout)
3. Add to cart.
4. If you have a custom request or favorite silver style? Feel free to let me know in the notes to TheRusticStamp section at checkout. 
5. Checkout (Please make sure your shipping address is correct, this can be changed when I go to create a shipping label but when I am busy I make no guarantees that I will remember to do that)
*Please remember all my products are silver-plated vintage silverware, this means they are not brand new. There may be some minor signs of wear from their previous lives (this includes minor scratches, minor plate loss or minor pitting) although I do my best to find silverware without wear. Also please expect for there to be a flat spot on the backside of the spoon behind each letter from the hammering process. 
**Also please note all my items are made to order. So no two items will be exactly alike and you will not receive the exact product in the picture. I personally stamp each letter/design by hand so please allow for slight variations in placement, spacing and straightness, all of this just adds to the handmade charm of the product. 
***For all of my items I go through the process of hand picking the silverware, hand polishing, hand stamping, hand washing for use and then packaging. All items are food safe, some people choose to use them on a daily basis and others choose to use it for display. I do recommend hand washing items and hand drying them. This helps reduce tarnishing (as a lot of dishwashing detergents contain bleach) as well as water spots. As vintage silver plated items naturally tarnish over time I do recommend using a silver polishing cloth to remove tarnish.

Adding personalizations increases the time it takes me to hand stamp these forks and then ship them to you.

~*~Please note- these are vintage silver plate flatware. Items will have wear and surface marks. Some areas of the silver plate can be thin or show wear. Forks will have some wear on the backside heels. These are not new flatware; they have had a prior life. I am a perfectionist and have polished and inspected each piece. Hand washing is recommended. Silver plate will tarnish over time. 
~*~These vintage silver plate forks are hand stamped by me. I stamp each letter and number individually. There will be variations in spacing and depth of stamp. This adds to the beauty and charm and not considered a defect.
** I ship USPS First class with tracking. USPS Priority upgrade is available for an additional charge. Upgraded shipping is for faster shipping, NOT faster creation and processing time. I hand make everything in my Etsy store. This takes time. 
Added personalizations adds to the creations and processing time.        ",32.00,4.9289,"Handmade item

            INDIVIDUAL PIE SLICE BOXES- life is good isn't it? A great way to have a grab-and-go dessert:)
All you need is Love.....and maybe a little Pie!
**If you need a 'lid' or a cover for your pie slice box, please check out my listing here for cute, clear, cello bags you can slide the boxes into- show off your creations and keeps it covered!**
www.etsy.com/listing/232382269/25-clear-cello-bags-5x2.5x11-party-favor?ref=shop_home_active_2
Designed and produced by me, these little boxes are the perfect size for your slice of pie- believe me, my family ate a lot of pie to test them out:) No need for plates!
These boxes are made of sturdy chipboard that feels like you have a good handle on your piece of deliciousness (you don't want pie in your lap!) They hold a regular piece of pie or cheesecake cut out of a 8 or 9 inch pie dish.
Easily put together by you, each box comes flat and ready to fold on the creased sides.  Adhesive dots come with each box to stick them together, but for best results,  a small glue gun works best- 3 drops on the edges and your done- especially if you are making them up a few days before your event.
PIE BOX KITS include:
*Pie Slice Box with adhesive dots
*Paper Doilie or Waxed Parchment- Let me know at checkout
*Wooden Fork
PIE BOX ONLY include:
*Pie Slice Box with adhesive dots
Choose  your quantity for KITS or PIE BOXES ONLY in the drop down box when ordering.

Dress up your box with bakers twine, ribbon, washie tape, rustic twine, pie labels etc,  These great boxes can be decorated  and used for every season-  Spring weddings, summer picnics, fall harvest parties, or a cozy Christmas get together.
Great idea to serve at a cheesecake bar- have the pieces in boxes and your guests can put their own topping on- yum!

My wares are all true vintage silver plate and have been upcycled to give them new life and purpose! They may or may not show various signs of wear collected over the years.  All adding to the history, character and romance that is the world of vintage!  Each piece is carefully hand selected by me and will be gorgeous but not brand new. 
I hand stamp each individual letter into the plate giving it a very personal and human touch. It may not be perfectly straight but that is what makes it special and handmade. Each piece is stamped with a hammer and with my heart!
If you don't see what you are looking for in my store, please let me know and I will create a custom listing for you. If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, please send me a convo. I'll respond quickly!
Thank you for stopping by Eve of Joy!

Patterns will vary depending on pieces currently in stock, but will always be just as beautiful, I promise!!
** Please carefully review the complete description before ordering**
Each vintage silver piece created by Bella Jackson Studios is hand selected for it's charachter, design and charm, and then lovingly hand stamped one letter at a time to create a special and unique gift for you.  Because of the nature of hand-stamping, it is impossible to guarantee that letters will be perfectly aligned.  Some tool markings are evident on the front sides as well as the back sides, as evident in the photos.  
No two pieces are exactly alike due to pattern, placement of letters, alignment, depth of impression and uniformity of letters.
Silver plate also will vary in thickness, tint and patina from piece to piece.   Due to the age and uniqueness of our pieces, imperfections are to be expected and cherished.
Coloring of the letters will wear off over time depending on frequency of use and method of cleaning, but the stamping impression will still be visible.
HANDWASHING IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.
Please send me a message with any special requests or questions,
thank you for shopping Bella Jackson Studios.        ",36.95,4.9609,"Handmade item

After your design is engraved, the boards ship ready to use and enjoy!
Please be aware that natural wood is known (and loved) for its unique patterns, so expect some variation in grain and marks from the photos shown. All photos are sample photos, and your board(s) will not look identical to the ones pictured.

BOARD COLOR VARIATIONS: Our boards are made from natural wood and are never stained in the process. Due to the natural origin of the wood, there will be color variations that might be different from what is shown in our listings.
ENGRAVING COLOR VARIATIONS: Our cutting boards are engraved using a high density laser beam. Due to this burning process, the coloration of the end engraving varies dependent on that particular piece of wood and how it reacts to the laser beam.
TECHNOLOGY: Each and every board is made from a high grade natural wood. All boards are made by us in our own shop and carefully checked prior to the engraving process. Personalization is achieved by using the state of the art laser engraver. Last, but not least, each board is completed by application of Straga Cutting Board Butter for the board's protection; therefore, you get a fine-looking FINISHED cutting board!

Sock/Fingering Weight
Aegean Multi: variegated shades of deep blue-green, avocado, amethyst, blueberry and emerald.   Please note that I have tried to capture the color accurately, but my camera (and perhaps your monitor) may result in some variation.
• Each skein weighs 100 to 103g, approximately 428 to 441 yards
• Approximately 7 to 8 stitches per inch on US #1-3 needles
• Hand dyed with color-fast acid dyes
• Machine or hand washable, dry flat
• Priced per skein. If multiple skeins are available, they are from the same batch
• In stock and ready to ship! Click dropdown arrow below price to see quantity currently available
• There may be some variation from skein to skein, even within the same batch. For best results, alternate skeins every few rows in projects using multiple skeins.
Smooth and soft, a treat to knit. Spun with a tight twist for great stitch definition and better resistance to pilling. One skein is enough for a pair of socks or a lacy scarf. This yarn is dyed and stored in a dry, smoke-free environment.

14702,"2 for 20 Multicolor Recycled Sari Silk Ribbon Yarn, 3.5 oz / 100 grams, 55 yards each, Upcycled, Bulky, Craft, Jewelry, Knit, Crochet, Weave","
            Save by buying by twos -- get two skeins for 20!! That's 5 off of two skeins -- a 20% savings! Hurry and get yours -- supplies are limited.
When silk fabric is cut and made into saris, wraps, and veils, there is always a bit left over. Rather than throw that waste fabric into the trash, it has been made into a beautiful, unique, soft yarn! Direct from India, this yarn is a truly recycled product! It is a bulky weight and is soft and easy to knit or crochet. 
These skeins are slightly bigger than some others that are listed on Etsy and come in gorgeous, saturated colors -- purples, blues, greens, golds, yellows, pinks, silvers and more! They are very soft and light! Each skein / hank weighs approximately 3.5 ounces (100 grams) and measures 50-60 yards of ribbon. The width of the yarn varies from 1/2-inch to 1-1/2 inches and each section of color is about 1 yard in length; all sections are sewn together end to end to make these continuous multicolor masterpieces!
Upon purchase, you will receive two multicolor skeins. Though no two skeins of this ribbon are exactly alike, they are all very similar and contain the same color groups. All are of similar color shades and can be considered complimentary and coordinating.
This yarn makes wonderful hats, scarves, bags, trim, fringe, wraps, jewelry and more!
Get creative with silk this season and save!

14838,Rabbit Felting Kit - Needle Felting Kit - DIY Kit - Craft Kit - Felting Supplies - DIY Craft Kit - Starter Kit - Needle Felted – Beginner,"
            Bunny Needle Felting Kit
Included in this kit: 
     * grey Romney wool. 
     * felting cushion
     *2 Felting needles
(If you already have felting cushion and needles please choose the no cushion and needles option)
     *Small amount of white wool for facial features and tail.
     *Glass eyes
     *Step by step instructions with photographs of each step
       by fiber artist and shepherd Teresa Perleberg.  5 pages of instructions with high quality pictures.
OPTIONS:
   *Complete kit - This kit has everything listed above, and is everything you need to complete this kit except for needle and thread to sew in the eyes.  
   *No cushion and needles - I offer this option for those who would like to purchase more than one kit.  You will only need one set of needles and one cushion for multiple felting projects.  Please note that I remove the cushion and needles from a complete kit for this option.  The packaging will stay the same and will state that the cushion and needles are included even though they have been removed.  
You will love working with this wool it comes from our beautiful flock of Romney sheep.
The bunny made in this kit will measure approximately 2-3 inches tall depending on how firmly it is felted.    
No sewing, knitting, crocheting skills are needed for this kit.  
(¯`*•.¸(¯`*•.¸ Customer reviews of this Bunny Needle Felting kit:¸.•*´¯)¸.•*´¯)
~LOVED making this little bunny!!! Step by step directions are easy to follow. First time I attempted felting and my bunny is adorable. I even made a little owl with leftover wool. Also, super fast shipping and well packaged!
~Adorable kit with clear instructions-- a great gift!
~Teresa is wonderful to work with and her designs are super cute! She went out of her way to get these kits to me, for which I am thankful. I'm currently working on the rabbit kit. The instructional booklet is clearly written and includes several pictures. I've never tried felting before and I'm having no problem whatsoever in following along. I am quite happy with this purchase and the way my little rabbit is turning out. Thank you!
(¯`*•.¸What do I mean when I say this kit is advanced beginner?¸.•*´¯)
     *  Everything in this kit is designed for a person just starting out in needle felting.  When I say it      is advanced I am telling you that there are easier kits available in my shop than this one.  Some may be able to pick up this kit to start needle felting for the first time and make the cutest bunny ever without any difficulties.  Others may feel more comfortable with a beginner kit that has you attach a round ball to a round ball for their first project and have it turn out beautifully and then try this kit next.  If you have done any needle felting at all in the past you can master this kit and learn some new techniques in the process.
Children under 10 years should have adult supervision.
Fast shipping is a priority!  
Packaged in a resealable plastic bag that is suitable for gift giving.
Packaged in a smoke free home.

15009,Deluxe Drop Spindle Kit,"
            Drop spindle kits make a wonderful gift for a new spinner looking to dip their toe into an ancient art form, or for an experienced spinner who likes to spin on the go. These spindles have a whorl diameter of 3 inches, and are approximately 13 inches long from the hook to the bottom of the spindle. Each kit will come with a variety of different breeds of wool depending on what I have in stock, adding up to 3oz of luscious, hand dyed fiber!  If there are specific colors you want, let me know at the time of purchase, otherwise I will surprise you!  
All my rovings are dyed by me with professional quality procion dyes and are color fast. My studio is pet free and smoke free. I dye in small quantities by hand painting the dye on the fiber. 
Please note that while I try my best to guarantee color fastness, colorways containing turquoise are prone to bleeding when washed. Please take care to hand wash to avoid felting!        ",20.00,4.8824,"Handmade Supply

15031,Niddy Noddy - 1 yard Collapsible Travel Size Bamboo,"
            This handy little niddy noddy tool is used to wind the yarn you've spun into a skein off of your drop spindle or spinning wheel bobbin.  Its press fit construction holds it securely together while in use, yet it easily collapses flat into two pieces for easy storage.  It is easily taken apart and reassembled.  The diameter of your skein will be 1 yard which also makes it useful for skeining smaller amounts of spinning.  Its short length allows it to fit easily into your spinning bag, making this the ideal travel tool for any spinner.  No more trying to jam a standard 2 yard niddy noddy in only to have it hang out the top!  
This affordable niddy noddy is laser cut from durable bamboo plywood.  Each piece is hand sanded after laser cutting to smooth out corners and edges to make sure that your yarn slides smoothly off of each end. It measures approximately 4.5""x10"" when assembled and 5""x7""x1/4"" when collapsed and inserted into its packaging.  Your niddy noddy will arrive to you in a padded envelope in a reusable sheath made of elastic straps mounted onto thick cardboard.  You may want to continue storing it in this packaging to keep both pieces together to ensure its longevity.   
It is important to me that each item I make is special and bamboo contributes to this as a unique material. Bamboo plywood is sustainable and is stronger than wood. Your niddy noddy tool won't be indestructible but can withstand a lot of yarn winding. Bamboo has a rich history of roles and uses in Asian mythology and culture and is even used in Chinese medicine because of its anti-bacterial properties. 
To assemble, hold a piece of the niddy noddy in each hand and match up the slots.  The two ends will be perpendicular to each other with the long part of each piece forming the center shaft as they come together.  To use your niddy noddy you'll be holding it at the center of the shaft.   Start by wrapping the loose end of the yarn around the top left end a couple times, trapping your initial wrap underneath your working yarn to secure it.  From the top left you'll cross down and under the right handle, then back up and over the left end of the top handle, then back down under the right end of the lower handle.  Once you're out of yarn, weave the loose ends of your skein through to secure them and prevent tangling.  Then slip the yarn off the ends of the niddy noddy handles.  To twist the yarn into a skein, slip the fingers of each hand through either end of the skein and twist in opposite directions until the yarn twists back onto itself.  Tuck one end into the other and you have a twisted skein.  
Because it is made of a natural material, the appearance of each piece may slightly vary. Please contact me if you would like a custom tool based on this design.  If you would like me to etch a name or (short) message onto it, please leave it in the notes when you check out.        ",20.00,4.9828,"Handmade Supply

15561,Polymer Clay Tutorial ENGLISH ONLY Pdf Format - Masterful Faux Made Easy,"
            This tutorial is offered in English only.
Polymer Clay PDF Tutorial Diva Designs Masterful Faux Made Easy 
In this tutorial, I will teach you my technique for creating realistic-looking turquoise similar to Carico Lake Turquoise, Fox Turquoise, African or Yellow Turquoise, Chinese Turquoise, Number 8 Turquoise, King Manassa Turquoise, Kingman Turquoise, Pilot Mountain Turquoise, Purple Turquoise, Boulder Turquoise, Royston Turquoise, White Buffalo Turquoise, and my versions of Dalmation Jasper, Orange Sponge Coral, Sonora Sunrise, African Jasper, Blue Lapis and Pink Rhodochrosite.
My favorite gemstone is turquoise.  It amazes me that you can find so many hues of blues and greens in one stone, so naturally, it was the first stone I tried to recreate when I started working with polymer clay six years ago.  I had some good results, but was never completely satisfied because I could not accurately capture the natural matrix in genuine turquoise.     
The key to a realistic-looking faux polymer turquoise is duplicating a great matrix, those crackled lines and mottled, speckled spots which appear in genuine turquoise.  Turquoise matrix can be black, brown, golden brown, red, and even turquoise in color.  It can be very pronounced in some stones, and hardly visible to the eye at all in others; such as the rare and extremely expensive Sleeping Beauty Turquoise, which is almost entirely a bright sky blue.  
Turquoise is also one of the most duplicated faux finishes in polymer clay.  There are many recipes and tutorials out there for polymer turquoise.   My method is fun, easy to do, and does not require expensive tools and equipment.  
This technique does not require a high level of skill to successfully create the faux finishes included.  If you can condition clay and possess the basic tools, materials and supplies every polymer artist uses on a daily basis, you will be able to use this tutorial with ease.   If you are new to polymer clay and do not have these every day items, email me and I will help you with a list of the basic items you will need in addition to the materials and tools list included for this specific tutorial, none of which are expensive or difficult to find. 
As with my Controlled Marbling Tutorial, this tutorial is intended to be about the technique.  I include suggestions on how to use recipes, with photos and some basic instructions for earrings, a slide, a pendant and coin beads.  The suggestions are intended to be guides and are not specifically ""projects.""   They do not include finishing tips or instructions.  
Please note that alcohol inks are used in some of the recipes included in the tutorial.  As much as possible, I have tried to include substitutes to be used instead of alcohol ink for those of you who may not be able to find every color of Ranger and/or Pinata Alcohol Ink on the market, particularly those of you who live outside the U.S.   If I have not included a substitute, email me and I will do my best to help determine a good substitute for you.  
If you live outside the U.S., postal regulations prohibit delivery of items containing alcohol from being mailed through the post office.  It is my understanding they must be mailed via ground delivery, meaning UPS or FEDEX. 
The tutorial also contains numerous tips from me which I have learned through trial and error and happily pass along to you, which I hope will help make the creative process easier, more fun, and more successful for you. 
My goal in writing my tutorials is to make you feel as if I am sitting right beside you as you create.  I research my techniques for months before I begin to write each new tutorial.  If you have any questions about the process or need clarification about any part of the tutorial, I am always available to help if you need assistance. 
Some basic knowledge and experience with polymer clay is helpful, but not absolutely necessary. The instructions are aimed at the novice and the experienced clayer. 
Trish Hodgens at www.polyclayplay.com has generously agreed to offer my customers a discount off the supplies in my tutorials that she carries.  Trish will carry as many of the supplies and materials as possible used in my tutorials. Each tutorial has its own discount code, and I will email it to you upon purchase.  If you don't hear from me within 24 hours, please contact me here through Etsy.    
NOTICE: You may sell work you create using this tutorial, but any redistribution, re-sale or reproduction of the tutorial itself, in whole or in part, in ANY form, is strictly prohibited. If I determine that you are redistributing or selling any part of my tutorials, you will be barred from purchasing from my shop and I will take whatever legal action available to me to prosecute the theft of my property. To be clear, this means you may not share any part of this tutorial with a friend or family member who has not paid me for that additional copy or material first. If you want to order a copy for someone else, I would be happy to deliver it to an email address of your choosing as a gift from you. You may not share a print-out of, or your actual digital copy of, this tutorial in a polymer clay class, or guild meeting, either in person or digitally via Skype or other internet outlets or social media websites. I regret that I even have to mention this, but unfortunately, it has become necessary to address this issue. 
Thank you! 
Lynda

""The research and detail that went into the making of this tutorial is outstanding. Your willingness to make it available to others is more than generous.

""This is one of the best tutorials I've ever purchased. The wording and pictures are really precise and easy to follow.

It really is a lot of fun. I've already done five of these and they are all different and turned out beautiful. Whether you are a beginner or a pro, this tutorial will take you to a new place in your adventure with polymer clay. This tutorial has 47 pages that are done in beautiful color and for the price, if you are a polymer clay enthusiast, you must have this tutorial in your arsenal of things to do with clay.

15652,"Crushed Pyrite or Fool's Gold, Medium, 1 Ounce","
            This mineral's metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname of fool's gold. I have seen this mineral crushed and used in jewelry and it looks amazing! This material is perfect for small voids or small accents, with unlimited applications. Each of our products are handpicked to ensure superior quality (removal of host rock or other naturally occurring minerals).
Material Size and Quality:
Medium - material is considered to be medium to fine (sand), ranging between 2 millimeters to 0.25 millimeters (between sieves #10 - #60).
This product is NOT man-made, mixed with resin, or stabilized. Please be careful when buying crushed mineral since most products have a caveat in fine writing that states that this stone might be man-made, mixed with resin, or is made from a composite (generally, plain stone mixed with a dyed resin to make the product seem authentic and is allowed to be called natural). Stone authenticity is extremely important to all artisans; therefore, we strive to validate the source of all our minerals before they are processed and sieved.
As with any naturally occurring minerals, there can be some matrix or host rock mixed in with the product. However, we hand pick each unit to ensure that our product is of the highest quality. Please see product images for color, size, and quality. Picture taken in full - material is dry.        ",9.00,4.987,"Craft type: Jewelry making, Woodworking & carpentry

This realistic female mannequin hand is ideal for displaying or organizing jewelry, rings, corsages, and watches. It would also make a fantastic photo prop for bags, purses, or other items.
This hand is formed from lightweight, durable plastic. It stands up on its own, but also has space on the base for permanently securing it to a table or other surface. These items are new old stock, and may have wear from storage, but, as you can see, they still photograph well.

Wrist circumference: 5.25 inches / 13.3 cm
This photo prop mannequin is slightly smaller than a live person's hand, allowing for a wider variety of jewelry sizes to fit.

            Stunning Monogrammed Gold Layering Necklace, Layered Necklace Set of Three, Stacking Necklace, Stacked Necklace, Layer Necklace, Multi Strand Necklace, Bar Necklace by D'Rae Designs.
You can select to have the round disc monogrammed in your choice of Gothic or Corsiva letter styles, please see last photo for letter samples. Unfortunately, I do not have letters small enough to monogram the bar.  Please note that monogramming is done by hand stamping the disc and therefore the lettering is only on the front and not the back of the disc.
This necklace comes in a set of three (3) gold PLATED necklaces.  The necklaces ARE connected together as one (1) and CANNOT be worn separately.  The disc is 15mm and the horizontal bar is 1.25 inch in width. The shortest chain is a satellite chain, 16"" inches in length, the middle chain is a cable chain, 18"" in length (including the bar) and third chain is also a cable chain 22"" in length. With multi layering necklaces, some tangling will occur during wear.
➤ Also available in silver

❖ IMPORTANT NOTE ❖
Each piece of personalized jewelry is caringly hand stamped by me, one at a time, never stamped by a machine.  I use the hand stamped technique to create your unique, one of a kind, piece of jewelry; no two will be exactly the same.  Please know I try very hard to make each and every piece beautiful during the stamping process but there may be some curvature or slight imperfections on the disc and in letter placement and spacing, this is what makes your piece of jewelry so special.  Also note that the disc is only stamped on the front and the back of the disc will have a slight imprint of the letter from stamping imprint of the letter.  This is a natural process of stamping and does not affect the front of the disc.
❖ CLEANING AND CARING FOR YOUR JEWELRY ❖
To ensure that your jewelry stays bright, keep it in an airtight container or a sealed bag like Ziplock. After each use quickly give it a clean with a dry cloth before placing into airtight bag or container. We recommend putting your jewelry on last when getting ready, as direct exposure to hair-styling products and perfume will often also damage the metal and gemstones. Do NOT use jewelry when swimming in chlorinated, thermal or salt water OR when showering. Also avoid wearing silver while exercising as this will cause sweat and other toxins, which can contribute to tarnish.
To clean, use a non-abrasive cleaning material like a mild dish washing liquid diluted in water. Use a polishing cloth to restore the shine after washing. Paste or strong jeweler cleaner is not recommended for plated metal as it may remove the plated silver or gold. Do not let your jewelry come into contact with nail polish removers, perfume or hairspray.

CARE INSTRUCTIONS
In order to extend the life of your plated pieces, do not wear in the swimming pool, the beach, or in the shower.  Remove jewelry when sleeping, exercising, or doing other physically strenuous activities, as prolonged contact with sweat will cause the plating to wear away faster. In addition, avoid contact with perfumes, body oils, and other chemicals, including household cleaners. Never use chemical jewelry cleaners as these will wear away at the plating and do more harm than good. For light cleaning, gently polish with a soft, lint-free cloth in order to avoid scratching. Store in a cool dry place.
………………………………….
CUSTOMIZE -- PLEASE READ 
To check out, please leave instructions in the NOTES section in your shopping cart with exact words and case (I will copy and paste as is), so if you do ""jgd"" in lowercase, I will engrave it in lowercase.  
Please be very specific in the NOTES section at checkout as to how you want it to read or look (e.g., as in photo, centered, top bottom, justified to the left or right, etc.).  If it's not specified, I will set it up as in the photos or at my discretion.  You can always attach a photo of your requested layout. Proofs are available for purchase below, as this does slow down our production time.
Special graphics will only be engraved on one side.  Special graphics are any designs not listed in the symbols or standard fonts images.  If the listing does not specify it is for a special graphic, or you would like to add a special graphic to more than one side, please use link below under “EXTRAS” to purchase custom artwork/special graphics.   
If engraving for front and back are chosen, but there are no specifications as to what is to be engraved on the back, it will be left blank.

16746,Key Necklace MANY FONT/CHAIN choices! | Hand Stamped Vintage Repurposed Giving Gifting Script lowercase,"
            ***See shop announcement for free shipping code and details.***
Are you a free-spirit, an explorer or a wild-hearted dreamer who colors outside the lines? Live your own truth and pave your own path...wear your mantra with pride on a vintage hand-stamped key necklace. Choose from the list of words below or submit your own custom word(s). 
Each key comes on a 24"", 27"", 30"" or 36"" chain...choose from a variety of options (see last image and drop-down listing on the right). If choosing the genuine copper ball chain, please note that solid copper will patina (darken) over time. This is a natural occurrence and not a defect. Some people prefer the patina, but if you want to keep your copper chain nice and bright, you can use a jewelry polishing cloth or cleaner. 
Please keep in mind when choosing a word that longer words might require me to use smaller letter stamps.
I M P O R T A N T : Some of these vintage keys are blanks (uncut keys). If you prefer a key that has been cut, BE SURE to leave me a note in the ""notes to seller"" section during checkout.   If you receive an uncut key and decide you'd rather have it cut, I suggest taking it to your local hardware store (or any Lowe's or Home Depot) and have it cut for around 1.  Many vintage keys have old markings that I will have to stamp over or around.  If you request a cut key with no markings, please know that this is not always possible.  If you prefer a key without any existing markings, please request a blank (UNCUT) key with no existing markings. Vintage keys are not identical, and each have varying degrees of wear. 
C U S T O M   W O R D S : If your custom word includes more than 10 characters, please purchase the quote key listing, here: 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/249001548/quote-key-necklace-hand-stamped-vintage?ref=shop_home_active_8
F O N T :  I offer several different font choices (see second image).  Please specify your font choice in the ""notes to seller"" section during checkout, otherwise I will use uppercase.

Please keep in mind that each letter is individually stamped by hand...this means that some variation in spacing, depth and alignment can be expected. Remember that perfection is not the intent with hand-stamped lettering. Some keys may also have old markings from their previous lives.  If you have your heart set on a specific style or shape of key, please let me know and I will do my best to accommodate you.  Please note: I do not have any keys like the ""FEARLESS"" key in the second image.  
If you'd like to choose your own key from my available inventory, purchase the listing below, along with your key necklace and let me know what kind of key you're looking for. I'll send you an image of 4-5 available keys to choose from.

            A mala is used for reflection, yoga practice or as part of your bohemian style. They can be worn by anyone who wants a more mindful, peaceful life. You can wear this mala as a bracelet or as a necklace.
A mala has many names and is also referred to as yoga beads, meditation beads, prayer beads, mala necklace, japa mala, yoga necklace, yoga jewelry, rosary and mala beads.
* White Jade brings peace, harmony and luck.Is also wonderful in the decision-making process, as it blocks distractions, allowing for the best results to reveal themselves (which makes it especially useful for children).
Physically, White Jade assists the body to heal itself, helps with bladder and kidney problems, and eases the pain of arthritis and other joint illnesses, especially in the hips. White Jade also helps with fluid retention, high blood pressure and imbalances in blood sugar levels.
- I made this Mala with cotton cord, 8 mm wood beads, genuine Mashan white Jade beads, cotton tassel and one antique bronze ohm charm. 
The length of this mala is 18 inches (46 cm) - with the tassel.
 I can make this Mala with elastic cord too,just type ""ELASTIC CORD"" at the ""NOTE TO SELLER"" section.
The polished jade beads add fashion,style and decent beauty to this Mala.
- Your purchase will include a card detailing the healing properties for this mala along with a organza mala bag, perfect for giving as a gift.
Practice your mala meditation daily, weekly, monthly or whenever you feel that your body and mind are in need of clarity, peace and an escape from the hustle and bustle of the busy world.
Please select your finish.

16854,Spinner Ring for Women. Spinner Ring for Men. Fidget Ring. Spinning Ring. Turning ring. Narrow Spinner Ring. Meditation Ring. Worry Ring.,"
            Spinner rings crafted of sterling silver, copper and brass. These are one of my favorites to wear. I wear it on my thumb, sometimes on my forefinger. It keeps me from twitching when I can't move around.
The band is  just under 1/4 inches wide. It's one of my narrower spinner rings. They come in a tidy little box appropriate for gifting. 
Speaking of gifting- these rings are crafted individually as you order them. They won't be ready in time for the USPS Christmas shipping cutoff of December 20. I just want everyone to be aware of the time it takes to build these items. 
The dark patina is standard on only one ring - but if you ask, I'll be happy to apply it to any of the options.

****** IMPORTANT STUFF ABOUT SIZING & COPPER RINGS ****** 
Since the band is wider than a standard ring, I recommend going up a half size bigger than your usual thin band size. If you size your ring for a wider band of at least 3/16ths inch, use that size.
Many people find that wearing jewelry containing copper or brass will cause a darkening (green) on the skin where the metal touches. This discoloration comes off with soap and water and is not harmful.  If you are not wearing the ring for health benefits, you may want to apply a thin layer of clear nail polish to eliminate the discoloration. Since people often wear copper jewelry to help with issues such as arthritis, I do not apply sealants to the metal.
Like the rings but you have something *slightly* different in mind? Send me a message through Etsy to discuss it :)
Care Kits -  Available under Shipping Options when you check out 
When you check out, you'll be able to add a care kit to your package. The care kit contains a 5"" by  7"" polishing cloth, a white foam tarnish remover square, and a tarnish preventing baggie (has chemical absorbers built into the bag).

            A shorter version of our best selling Minimalist Ear Climber! Simple, elegant, but cutting edge! These minimalist sleek ear climbers hook in like bobby pins so the ear wire backing hugs the behind the ear, and can be adjusted for a perfect fit. They are very comfortable.
Made from 1.5mm lightly hammered wire. 
Choose from: Sterling Silver, 14k Yellow Gold Filled or 14k Rose Gold Filled, or solid 14K Yellow Gold. 
These Ear climbers are .75"" vs the originals which are 1.25"" long. 
(See my shop for the original listing)
*Choose from a single earring for the left or right ear, or a set of 2 ear climbers
Gold Filled has 100 times more gold than gold plated jewelry. Gold filled wire is created by taking a sheet of 14 karat gold and bonding it through extreme heat and pressure to a core of semi-precious metal (brass). This is a very sophisticated process and only a few mills in the world do it. You should not mistake this process for gold plating as there is a very big difference.

17485,I Loved You First Tie Bar Clip - Hidden Message - Personalized for Father of the Bride - Tie Tac Tie Tack - Father of Bride Tie Bar,"
            This Father of the Bride tie bar is a great gift from his little girl before the walk down the aisle. It can be personalized with with his initials on the front and the message will be hidden on the back of the bar. This tie bar has a brushed finish and is not shiny. Perfect for every occasion and a great reminder of your special day!
An aluminum base will be hand-stamped and then formed into this tie bar. It measures approx. 1/4"" x 2.5"" when complete (may vary slightly due to the hand formed nature of this piece). This design is given a brushed finish shown in the detail photo. Aluminum is lightweight, but sturdy. It will not tarnish and is a wonderful alternative to silver.
Please note that these are individually hand-stamped and will not be perfectly straight and uniform. This is not an imperfection, rather a reminder of the individuality of each piece. There will be tiny tool marks from the bending process on the back side of this tie bar, but they will not be visible from the front. The tip of the back of the bar is bent to allow it to slide right onto the tie. Do not pry the two sides apart or it will not be tight enough to remain on the tie. I am not responsible for damage done to the bar after it has been received.

** In the Message to Seller section - Please list the initials for the front (if desired) carefully. The font will be the small uppercase shown in the photo. The front or back can be left plain with no stamping if you prefer and will be if you do not indicate stamping for that space.

            108 Prayer Mala Beads
A mala is used for reflection, yoga practice or as part of your bohemian style. They can be worn by anyone who wants a more mindful, peaceful life. You can wear this mala as a bracelet or as a necklace.
A mala has many names and is also referred to as yoga beads, meditation beads, prayer beads, mala necklace, japa mala, yoga necklace, yoga jewelry, rosary and mala beads.
- I made this Mala with cotton cord, 8 mm wood beads, genuine Amazonite beads, cotton tassel and one Tibetan silver charm. 
I can make this Mala on elastic cord, just type ""elastic cord"" at the ""NOTE TO SELLER"" section.
The length of this mala is 18 inches (46 cm) - with the tassel.
- Your purchase will include a card detailing the healing properties for this mala along with a organza mala bag, perfect for giving as a gift.
* Amazonite - Expression, Balance, Inspiration, Heart Chakra - is a “Stone of Success and Abundance”, attracting focus and good luck.
It is a good energy filter, blocking electromagnetic pollution emitted from computers, microwaves, or cell phones. Amazonite soothes aggravation and emotional trauma, eases irritation, and calms all of the chakras.
Physically, Amazonite can assist with throat, sinus, chest and lung issues. Use Amazonite to help in maintaining overall health and a healthy lifestyle.
Practice your mala meditation daily, weekly, monthly or whenever you feel that your body and mind are in need of clarity, peace and an escape from the hustle and bustle of the busy world.
Please select your tassel color and charm.
Please Note: All metaphysical or healing properties information listed has been collected from various sources. This information is offered for informational purposes only.

How to measure your wrist for a cuff bracelet:
Wrap a flexible measuring tape, strip of paper or string around your wrist right above the bone (the side closest to your elbow). If using the paper/string method, mark it where the end meets then measure it with a ruler. If your wrist falls between quarter inch increments, round up to the nearest quarter inch.
The bracelets are simple and elegant on their own, and they are also great for stacking.

18635,"Jack Daniels Whiskey Barrel Cufflinks - groomsmen gift, wedding gift, 5th anniversary gift, birthday gift, wood cufflink, Father's Day","
            These cufflinks are approximately 3/4 inch square, and about 0.2 inches thick. They are made from the charred end of Jack Daniels(R) Whiskey Barrels. Each piece is hand cut, and are cut from the the same stave.
The whiskey barrel pieces are carefully sealed to prevent any of the ash from coming off on clothing, and then 3-5 layers of clear coat are applied to add a light gloss and provide further protection of the ash and your clothing.
If you order these in addition to any pen made from Whiskey Barrel, we will make sure that your pen and cufflinks are all cut from the same stave.
These are shown with an antique brass metal finish, but can also be made in gold or chrome.
These will ship out of my shop in 3-5 business days. Right now, we are running closer to 3 days.
Do you own your own shop? If so, we do sell these cufflinks wholesale! Message me for more information.        ",20.00,4.9949,"Handmade item
