1397,Vintage 1930s Chinese Bakelite Mahjong Set |  152 Tiles |  American Chinese Mahjong Set |  Case Mahjongg |  Family Game Night,"
            The set is in a hard case that measures 19 ½” wide, 9” deep and 3 ¼” tall. The set, has its flaws but for all its flaws, also has some good things about it. It has value for a collector interested in having sets of many types and variations.
Set Description:
152, circa 1930s, hand carved and painted Chinese Bakelite tiles.  These tiles are solid Chinese Bakelite.  The tiles are overall in nice condition.  There are some random marks on the tiles, just a few small flea bites on a few tiles.  The paint is in nice condition as well, with light paint loss on some tiles.  Tile measures approx. 1 3/16"" by 7/8"" by 7/16""
Pair of green Catalin dice with white pips.  Measuring Approx. 1/2"" square.
Four Bakelite racks in purple, red, green, yellow and blue with bend-over type of chip pole.  The racks are in overall nice condition but note that the purple one has a small chip in the front, see picture 4.  The racks need to be cleaned, which I leave to the new owners.  Measures approx 16 3/8""
Brown faux alligator print case with two tile trays.  Heavy plastic handle, gold tone hardware. The case is in Fair condition. The corners show wear but the case closes and locks and the inside of the case has a stain but is in overall good working condition.
152 piece tile set
o 36 Dot tiles, 4 each of 1-9
o 36 Bamboo tiles, 4 each of 1-9
o 36 Crack tiles, 4 each of 1-9
o 16 Wind tiles: 4 each of East, North, West and South
o 12 Dragon tiles: 4 each of White, Red and Green 
o 8 Flowers: 2 complete bouquets, 1-4 
o 8 sticker flower tiles (one tile the sticker has worn off, as joker tiles (see below). 
So why the sticker tiles?  Through the years, the National Mah Jongg League changed the number of Flowers needed for play (as well as what the Flowers did, because Flowers did serve as jokers or wild tiles for some years). Many people hid Flowers, and the blank tiles that came with the set, under stickers to turn them into Jokers.
So is the set complete?  I believe the answer is yes, it is complete as shown.  Please examine the pictures carefully.

1400,Vintage Bakelite Mahjong Set in Faux Alligator Case. Circa 1930's - 1940's.,"
            This Vintage Bakelite Mahjong Set was made in the 1930's or 1940's. The tiles are made of bakelite in a great butterscotch color. The tile racks are  swirled bakelite. This would make a great for a playable set, or as an addition to a vintage bakelite collection. 
Case measurements:
19 1/2"" x 8 3/4"" x 3""
Condition:
The case is solid, but shows wear on the edges and corners, as well as staining on the underside of the lid. Latches work, but no keys. Tile racks are in good condition. This set includes 164 tiles. 8 of the tiles appears to be marked with nail polish(?). I believe this marks the joker tiles. 
Please look at all pictures carefully.

3072,Antique  Hair Receiver |  Derby Silver Co Hair Receiver 93 |  Silve Plate Hair Receiver | ,"
            Beautiful little antique Derby Silver Plate Victorian hair receiver, hallmarked.  This is a really nice little repousse' floral silver plate round hair receiver.
Derby Silver Company made all kinds of silver items, including mirrors, combs, clocks, tableware, flatware, cups, candlesticks, trophies, fruit baskets, dishes and more.  The Derby Silver Company sold a more affordable line of plated hollow ware under the popular trademark of the Victor Silver Plate Company.  Victor Silver Co. was the economical trade mark of the Derby Silver Company.
""Although rare today, the hair receiver was a common fixture on the dressing tables of women from Victorian times to the early decades of the 20th century. Its purpose was to save hair culled from the hairbrush and comb, which were used vigorously on a daily basis. The hair could then be stuffed into pincushions or pillows. Since hair was not washed as often as it is today, oils were frequently used to add scent and shine to hair. The residual oil made the hair an ideal stuffing for pincushions because it lubricated the pins, making it easier for them to pierce material. Small pillows could be stuffed with hair, which was less prickly than pinfeathers."" Compliments of http:\/\/www.go-star.com\/antiquing\/hairreceivers.htm
There may be significant plate loss due to the age of this, or it could just have heavy tarnish.  I will leave the cleaning up to the new owner.  Would make a great addition to any proper young lady's dressing table.

4506,Vintage AMELIA EARHART LUGGAGE,"

FACT: Loved this tweedy brown Amelia Earhart overnight bag the moment I saw it. I'm not sure who produced this collection but it is definitely mid century. It has wheels and a pull strap, no keys, and the inside is clean but needs a little re gluing on some of the liner.
21"" x 12""x7 1/2""
FICTION: Amelia never believed in packing for every occasion. All she wanted was a small bag to hold an extra pair of aviator glasses, a change of underwear, a leather jacket, some moisturizer, a tooth brush and her birth control.        ",38.00,4.971,"Vintage item from the 1970s

5821,Shiners Syria Red Fez Hat with Black Tassel & Red Shinny Pouch  I.O.B. Like New,"
            As the title proclaims being offered is a vintage fraternal order Shiners Syria Red Fez hat provided by the old Troutman's Companies complete with black tassel & accessories In original box like new. It is in an A.E. Troutmans Co. Store. And, under the name A.E. Troutmans Co. is ""Distinctive Appeal"". Troutmans Co. In Greensburg, Pa, closed in the late 70's or early eighties when the Mall became the new way to shop.
In 1870 a group of Masons gathered frequently for lunch at the Knickerbocker Cottage on Sixth Avenue in New York City. At a special table on the second floor a particularly fun-loving group of men met regularly. Among the regulars were Walter M. Fleming, M.D. and William J. “Billy” Florence, an actor. The group frequently talked about starting a new fraternity for Masons – one centered on fun and fellowship, more than ritual. Fleming and Florence took this idea seriously enough to do something about it.
Billy Florence had been on tour in France, and had been invited to a party given by an Arabian diplomat. The exotic style, flavors and music of the Arabian-themed party inspired him to suggest this as a theme for the new fraternity. Walter Fleming, a devoted fraternity brother, built on Florence’s ideas and used his knowledge of fraternal ritual to transform the Arabian theme into the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (A.A.O.N.M.S.).
With the help of the Knickerbocker Cottage regulars, Fleming drafted the ritual, designed the emblem and costumes, formulated a salutation and declared that members would wear the red fez.. The first meeting of Mecca Shriners, the first temple (chapter) established in the United States, was held September 26, 1872. This Red Fez Hat and Red Pouch and a small black item are what were in the box. The latest this would be is early eighties but it could be a good bit older, it hard to say
The emblem on the front of the fez, the crescent and scimitar, is an important part of the fraternity’s theme, and is representative of the characteristics embodied by the Shriners. The scimitar stands for the backbone of the fraternity, its members. The two claws are for the Shriners fraternity and its philanthropy. The sphinx stands for the governing body of the Shriners. 
The five-pointed star represents the thousands of children helped by the philanthropy each year.
Just let the pictures be your guide and I feel sure you won't be disappointed. The height size is 7-1/8"" and it is in great condition. The hat was made by Lou Walt Corp. New York N.Y,

            ↠↠ S H I P S ~ F A S T ↠↠
This eco-friendly, gender-neutral Wooden Baby Play Gym is a wonderful way to promote gentle sensory development for little ones.  Scandinavian-inspired while designed and handcrafted to be stylish, it is also economical, chemical-free and sustainable.  It folds up easily to be stored away, can fit into many decors with its neutral and natural wood look, and can be customized to your child's growing curiosity by changing out the toys as desired.
This gym comes complete with an adjustable wooden stand and three wooden rings that hang on the top bar allowing for toy customization (hanging toys are NOT included with purchase).  As your baby's curiosity grows, simply replace the toy of choice. For stability each pair of legs are secured with a durable cotton rope which can be re-tied and adjusted to increase the height of the structure to best fit your baby's reach. 
HANGING TOYS IN PICTURES ARE NOT INCLUDED
While we don't provide hanging toys, we recommend KOLOROVI's adorable hanging teether toys, found here:

Width - 2 ft.
Height - The height is 20"" and can be adjusted higher by re-tying the attached leather lace to preferred height.
This gym can be easily disassembled and stored in its original box, or folded down flat and stored away.  If you would prefer to keep the gym up all times, you can use glue to affix the dowel to the legs permanently. 
↠↠ S A F E T Y  &  A S S E M B L Y ↠↠
~ The gym is meant for newborns who will enjoy playing with and looking at hanging toys.  The gym itself is not a toy.  Please discontinue use once your newborn starts rolling over and becoming more mobile.
~ The gym ships to you with the top bar unattached from the two sets of legs.  Simply connect the two sets of legs to the dowel after hanging the three rings from the dowel.  No hardware or tools are needed.
~ The gym is made of natural pine wood with the corners sanded to include a smooth finish. The pieces are made by hand, with heart ~ not made in bulk on large machines. 
~ While each piece is custom-made and may vary in color and pattern, the knots and grain-texture only add to the character and look of your one-of-a-kind piece. 
~ For safety, please make sure there is 1/2 - 1 inches of bar length on either side of where the dowel attaches to the legs and that the cotton rope is securely attached to the legs at all times.
~ Babies should never be left unattended while under or around the gym. Before assembling, disassembling, or moving the play gym, remove baby from under gym first.  I am not liable or responsible for accidents under the user's supervision.

You can also personalize the clutches with a printed fabric label. I can print the labels with anything from intials, names or a personal message. The charge for this service is 6 per label.

What is Gold Filled?
Gold filled is an actual layer of 14K gold (rose gold is 20K), pressure bonded to a brass base metal. Gold filled has 100 times more gold than gold plating and is much more valuable and tarnish resistant. It does not flake, rub off, or turn color. It can be worn without worries of an allergic reaction to the jewelry. Gold filled jewelry is an economical alternative to solid gold, and should last many years. It is a keepsake quality material.

ABOUT GOLD FILLED JEWELRY
Gold-filled jewelry, also known as ""rolled gold""   which is composed of a solid layer of gold bonded with heat and pressure to a base metal such as sterling silver or brass. My high quality gold-filled pieces have the same appearance as 14 karat  gold.
Gold-Filled items are generally lifetime products, and the gold layer will not fade or wear off, as it will in plated products. Gold filled jewelry is often called the wave of the future because it offers all the same characteristics as solid gold such as strength, durability and beauty!
Caring for Gold Filled: Caring for Gold Filled items is as easy as caring for any gold jewelry. Simply keep away from chemicals, clean regularly with mildly sudsy water.        ",38.00,4.7381,"Handmade item

These are available in sterling silver here:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/238674350/red-ruby-earrings-red-cluster-earrings
GEMSTONES:
4 mm genuine ruby rondelles
LENGTH:
One inch including earwire
METAL COMPONENTS:
14K gold fill
WHAT IS GOLD FILL?
Gold fill is a high quality alternative to 14K gold. A solid layer of gold is bonded to coat brass or a metal alloy using heat and pressure to produce gold fill. It is still a very valuable material and will not chip, flake off or turn colors like inexpensive gold plate and contains much more gold than gold plate. Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have about this great alternative to 14K gold.
You can find the matching necklace here:

Each order will arrive carefully packaged in an elegant gift box suitable for gifting.
As with all handmade jewelry, the earrings may vary slightly from the ones featured in the photographs. Please note that all photos have been zoomed in to provide as much detail as possible so please check the measurements described above.

What is Gold Filled?
Gold filled is an actual layer of 14K gold (rose gold is 20K), pressure bonded to a brass base metal. Gold filled has 100 times more gold than gold plating and is much more valuable and tarnish resistant. It does not flake, rub off, or turn color. It can be worn without worries of an allergic reaction to the jewelry. Gold filled jewelry is an economical alternative to solid gold, and should last many years. It is a keepsake quality material.

18866,"Custom handpainted rainbow sneakers, personalized shoes, rainbow  converse, rainbow vans","
            Custom hand painted rainbow sneakers.
Acrylic paint on canvas non-brand shoes (hi or low top), Converse or Vans
Every size is possible. 
Shoes are hand painted using High grade acrylic paint. I use a special textile paint designed to be flexible on fabric. The paint is water proof and fade proof.
 Prices depends on what model of shoes you will choose. Here we have art on non-brand shoes but I can use Coneverse or Vans.
_______________
I offer you hand painted stuff in whatever theme you chose. You can pick a movie, tv show, book, character...Anything! If you want specific images on them then let me know and I can include those.
Please let me know what kind of shoe you want painted. VANS shoes work the best as the fabric holds the paint better, but I can paint pumps, boots and ankle boots as well. If you chose one of those styles you need to take extra special care of the shoes as the paint is more likely to get scratched easily. 
Let me know the style and your shoe size upon ordering as well as what you want painted on them, and feel free to send me any sketches or ideas you have.

19196,"Brass Chevron Cuff, hand formed modern brass cuff, wide gold cuff","
            This amazing cuff is made to be worn with the opening on the top of the arm, with the chevron pointing down to the hand. It is very comfortable and fits close to the wrist. It is made with a lighter gauge metal so it is light weight, not clunky and heavy.
This cuff measures 2 inches at the back and about 2 3/4 inches at the opening.
To wear this cuff, you can slide the opening on the narrow part of your forearm, then turn it so that the chevron is on top and then gently squeeze for a perfect fit.
This bracelet started out as a sheet of metal and after I drew the shape on it I cut it and then shaped it over special forming stakes with special hammers. It was then tumbled and hand finished all by me.
Because each cuff is individually hand made, yours will vary slightly from the photo. Each cuff is stamped with my maker's mark, and is a great gift for under 40.00
Please take the time to measure your wrist for a better fit.
Small fits wrists 6"" or less
Medium if your wrist is up to a 7 inches
Large if your wrist is up to 8 inches
Xlarge if your wrist is between 8 and 9 inches
I have used an anti tarnish product on this piece, but everyone reacts differently to metals. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that this will remain tarnish free. But you can use a metal polish if you don't like the patina or you can easily polish it with a lemon wedge and some salt and then wash in warm water.
