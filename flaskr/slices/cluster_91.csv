I am not a jeweler nor a gemologist but love vintage and estate jewelry. The information I impart is usually given to me when I acquire each individual piece. Therefore, sometimes I have quite a lot of details and other times very few. I try very hard to be as accurate as possible yet ALL descriptions and/or measurements are approximate. I test all gemstones on a Presidium Gem Tester and it is quite accurate. It cannot determine however whether the actual gemstone is a natural gemstone or a man made gemstone as they both are identical in every way. An accredited Gemologist would be the only individual qualified to do so. Stones such as turquoise, opals etc. do not register on the Presidium.
Please do not judge size from the photos. These are oftentimes enlarged to better show detail.
All pieces are vintage or antique…therefore expect the ring, pendant, 
bracelet, watch etc. to show signs of its age and use.
ANY OFFERS I ACCEPT OR ANY COUNTEROFFERS I MAKE WILL ONLY BE HONORED FOR 24 HOURS (from said offer and/or counteroffer)...AFTER THAT, THEY BECOME NULL AND VOID

AS COMFORTABLE FOR THE OWNERS AS IT IS FOR THE DOGS:  Everything is built with the dog's comfort in mind. The materials used are soft and will only get softer with age. Nothing is hard or uncomfortable, except for the needed hardware on the leashes (swivel snap hook), collars (buckles and rings), and squeaky toys (squeak box). 
INSPIRATION FOR THE PRODUCTS:  The inspiration for these products is our family dog, Brindy. She is a beautiful, hairy-hairless Chinese Crested, who sometimes will take the time out of her day to pose with our products in photos.  With her sensitive skin and her breed's tendency to have joint and teeth problems, these products were made with her in mind. All dogs can enjoy these products, from the most sensitive to the ones who don't have a care in the world.
UNIQUE ITEMS:  Our pet items are individually hand-crafted. No two pieces will be exactly alike, and the slight variations in the products make each piece unique. Our products are made with love and with pride in the U.S.A. We hope your dogs and you enjoy them!
PROCESSING: Normal processing time can be up to 1 week, sometimes up to 2 weeks.
PROCESSING:  HOLIDAY SEASON 2017:  During the holiday season, processing time takes longer. Orders received by Tuesday, December 5, 2017, will arrive in time for Christmas. Orders received Wednesday, December 6, 2017, through Monday, January 1, 2018, will not begin processing until January 2, 2018. 
SHIPPING: Shipping is USPS. Once the item is created, I will ship it out by the next business day.

They are not all geometrically perfect, but variations are minor, and they are all gorgeous.

It is very difficult to capture the color and fire of iridescent glass, but I do my best. Please understand that the colors in this listing look accurate to me, but may appear differently to you, depending on your monitor type and settings. 
In order to retain their beautiful surface gloss, these tiles are not tumbled, and therefore may have an occasional pointy edge. Please keep them out of reach of children and pets. 
Want a larger quantity or a different size? I've got lots more tiles in this size and color, and am happy to take custom orders for different shapes, sizes and quantities of stained glass tiles. Just ask!        ",5.95,4.9811,"Handmade Supply
