900,Vintage Silver Etruscan Almandine Garnet & Cornelian Stud Earrings,"
            Vintage Silver Etruscan Cabochon Almandine Garnet & Cornelian Cluster Stud Earrings
Circa 1900's
Unmarked but tested as silver
Diameter per earring = 2.2cm
Gross weight = 21.3 grams
These bold earrings are set with a central cabochon cornelian and seven cabochon garnets in an intricate hand-finished rope and bead setting. The dark patina has been retained, giving these earrings a fantastic vintage look.
Condition = Excellent. As you can see from photo 4, there appears to be a gap between the rope edges. It doesn't look like this has been broken, and is rather an indication of the hand-finished nature of these earrings. The ""band"" in one of the cornelian stones is a natural band within the stone and not a crack.

1580,Antique ecru filet lace curtain #5,"
            I was almost beside myself with excitement when I discovered six antique filet lace curtains in a box at a garage sale.  Wondering if they would survive washing I put them in the washing machine on a gentle wash.  Five of the six survived.  I have listed each drop separately as each one has a different flaw.
Each curtain has a wide piece of lace across the bottom 12cms or 5"" wide.  The curtain has antique curtain rings sturdily stitched into the hem across the top.
This curtain has one large hole on the right side, shown in the photos.
All my vintage linen is freshly laundered and pressed ready for use.

Vintage handbags are, in general, not as large as today's styles. TY!

THE FUN STUFF:
Here's an especially yummy baby boho bag that has an extra rich, yummy color scheme that is not a common one for this style. And at eight inches tall, this is the smallest of the Dooney and Bourke (DB) All-Weather Leather (AWL) drawstring handbags, was made in the USA, and is no longer in production. And it looks and feels like it is almost brand new.
This Dooney and Bourke AWL MINI DRAWSTRING (bucket bag, pouch, style# R134) was created in true vintage Dooney AWL brown – you can barely see the BN that represents brown on the paper sticker in the interior bottom. And its smooth leather trim and strap are created in bright British tan that has yet to develop a patina. And its brass is still gleaming -- shiny and new looking. I tend to gather up as many in this style as I can find because I find them to be very “now” looking and adorable, like little vintage stylish boho chic pouches.  
The leathers used to handcraft this boho bag are super thick and rugged – this may be a small pouch, but it is very tough and durable.
This one is in very excellent vintage condition and still looking and feeling almost brand new (full details under CONDITION). You can tell that it has seen minimal wear.
This is a petite-sized bag, pouch-like, that's right for anyone who does not carry around all of their worldly possessions with them at all times (like I tend to), or as a side bag/second bag. 
Definitely festival-ready, and its crossbody style makes for a wonderful traveling (and dancing) companion! 
________________________________________
FEATURES: 
- DB AWL pebbled leather with smooth leather trim and strap
- solid brass hardware used throughout
- adjustable leather crossbody strap with solid brass hardware
- impeccable DB stitchwork throughout in traditional Dooney yellow
- well preserved signature leather duck emblem on front
- intact DB sewn in “Made in USA” tag with serial/ID number 
- thick leather drawstring with plush leather tassels
- brass hardware stamped ""Solid Brass""
- rivets stamped ""Dooney  Bourke"" 
- solid brass DB duck fob with British tan strap 
Like all DB AWLs, this drawstring is unlined. The thick raw suede interior is the back of the exterior brown pebbled leather. 
________________________________________
CONDITION: 
This MINI DRAWSTRING is in very, very excellent vintage condition and it could be mistaken for new. Its smooth British tan leather has yet to develop a patina and has no obvious markings on it, so you know that it has seen very, very little wear. 
I found three very minor issues:
- the slightest bit of scuffing on the exterior pebbled leather, back left area.
- just a smattering of faded ink hash marks on its interior, towards the heavy-duty bottom edge seam, that is actually a very thick, corded cotton seam, just like it is in the larger vintage DB AWL drawstring handbags.
- a less that perfect solid brass duck fob because it has an oh so little bit of scuffing on it – very minimal.
That's it! 
And I am thrilled to tell you that this one does not have any splits along the top leather trim/edging that encompasses the opening of the bag. Also, I made sure to use extra leather conditioner on this top trim leather, and to really let it get absorbed, and then I did it again. Those who follow my shoppe know that I often report that the top trim on this style is prone to splits and cracking, so keeping it well conditioned it a safe way to go, I think, especially during these winter months when dwelling interiors can tend to be on the dry side. What else causes this to happen, ever? Well, one of the reasons I think  has to do with the smallness of the bag juxtaposed to the thickness/stiffness of the AWL pebbled leather (it is very thick). So the top trim area on these handbags is a vulnerable area, imho. Best to be sure to keep it nice and supple to assure a crack-free future. : )
So:
- With the exception of very minuscule scuffing on the exterior back left side that I point out in the photos, the chocolate brown exterior leather looks and feels unworn.
- The smooth British tan trim is also unmarred. It still looks very clean and even its bottom edges/corners are unscathed. Impressive. And as just stated, the top British tan trim is also intact and looks like it is brand new.
- Its front signature leather duck patch is a lovely tone and does have some variation of tone to it. Please check it out in the photos.
- The long bridle leather crossbody strap on this one seems like it was rarely ever worn – like new, pretty much. It still has all of its original lacquer coating along its edging and its solid brass hardware is gleaming. Also very impressive.
- Its original solid brass duck fob is also still gleaming, but I cannot say that it is perfect because in the close-up of it you can see that it is a little scuffed. In person, without the camera magnification, you cannot even see that it is less than perfect.
- The interior suede of this MINI is the color of milk chocolate. You can see its original Dooney paper sticker still affixed in the very bottom of the pouch. - Its plush suede interior is in a lovely tone, and looks clean, BUT it has that faint bit of ink pen markings, just a slight smattering. They are not obnoxious and there are very few, but I found them in there, under careful inspection.
- The leather drawstring is still in amazingly great condition, still very intact, clean and strong, and its leather tassels are still plush. I am super impressed that its drawstring is in “like new” condition.
- No odd odors and no verdigris/brass rust to report.
- Impeccable, very clean, yellow stitchwork.
I have thoroughly cleaned/sanitized/reconditioned this baby bucket bag, focusing on the smooth British tan leather, especially around the top. 
This is such a cool looking little pouch – super sturdy. Rugged yet regal and refined. Oh so very classic Dooney. 
Vintage Dooney and Bourke handbags are highly sought after, very collectible, and built to last (and last and last). They just do not make them like this any longer. This is such a cool classic that is still so very relevant today (drawstrings never seem to go out of style). This one's a definite keeper and has quite a fun, carefree vibe to it, while its coloring adds a certain sophistication. NICE!

****IMPORTANT: My home is not 100% pet-free nor smoke-free, BUT my “shop” (converted extra guest bedroom) IS, and the door to it is closed 24/7. Also, my home IS 100% fragrance-free (as much as it can be, since artificial fragrances are all over everything now and unavoidable) as I have severe multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS) due to late-stage Lyme disease. I carry vintage items that can be decades old and may have lingering fragrance and/or smokey odors. It is the nature of buying and selling vintage. I also have the nose of a bloodhound (or vampire) – a side-effect of Lyme – and fragrance odors have a terribly negative effect on my central nervous system, so I REALLY do get it. While I try my very best to eliminate all odors, sometimes it is impossible. Thank you for your understanding.****        ",105.00,5.0,"Vintage item

4509,"Miniature Leather Coin Purse, Tiny Vintage Coin Purse, Victorian Soft Leather Purse, 1800s Antique Purse, Tiny Purse, Miniature Purse","
            Miniature vintage leather coin purse (1800's).
This beautiful little purse is such a gorgeous vintage find. Made from soft leather and brass (with white metal coating), it is so sweet and tactile.
As you will see from the photos this tiny purse has clearly been well-used over the years but, considering its ripe old age, it is in good vintage condition. The beautifully soft leather is discoloured, scuffed and worn in places and there is some tarnishing removed from the white metal clasp, but these simply add to its character and charm.
The clasp still works but is quite delicate.
Material: soft leather, brass with white metal coating
Measurements: 2"" W x 2.5"" H
Condition: good for its age (see shop Policies page). 
This beautiful vintage purse would make such a special Christmas gift for any antique bag or purse collector.
If you have any questions please feel free to contact me :)

10027,"Cribbage Board - Continuous track, 3 player, swooped profile with peg and card storage. Figured maple and walnut.","
            Why play such a fun game on a boring board? This custom made board has an elegant swooped top, angled sides, and dovetail ends. The best feature has to be the sliding dovetail end which reveals storage space for the cards and pegs. A magnet holds the end in place when closed. 
The board comes in a combination of a spectacular figured maple playing surface with walnut trim. Pictures can not do this board justice. The highlights of curly maple change depending on the viewing angle and light source, so the wood appears to shimmer as you look at it. Each board's grain pattern is different, but as I hand pick all of the wood, I can promise you a stunning board.
The board is roughly 18"" x 5"" x 2"" and comes with nine metal pegs, game rules, and felt pads for the bottom of the board. Cards not included. You have a choice of standard pegs or tall pegs. The standard pegs are 1-1/8"" and the tall pegs are 1-1/2"". Both sit 5/16"" deep into the holes. 
For a personal touch, you can add custom engraving to the end or bottom. Please use this listing to order:

♥ Bring Peace and Strength to your life with this Mala ♥
This Blue Lapis Mala is handmade and has 108 genuine beads plus the Guru stone to aid with meditation.
Keep these Mala Beads for your self or give it as a Valentines day gift, Birthday Gift, Christmas Gift, Anniversary gift or any other special occasion.
It's about 14 inches long when worn around the neck and is Hand Made with:
*Lapis Lazuli 6mm beads
*Green Jasper
*Gold plated accents 
*Guru Crystal - please choose from the below crystals in the Dropdown Menu:
   *White Jade
   *Yellow Jade 
   *Rose Quartz 
   *Green Fluorite (pictured on the     necklace) 
   *Turquoise
   *Blue Lapis Lazuli
   *Green Aventurine
 
This Necklace can also come with a cotton Tassel instead of crystals. Please see the listing here:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/259227216/108-mala-mala-necklace-lapis-mala-mala?ref=listings_manager_grid
♥Lapis Lazuli has helpful energy. It can bring mental and emotional virility and strengthen the mind. It also is said to enhance creativity.  Its energy can help organize daily life as well as organizing and quieting a busy or restless mind, lessening confusion, and increasing concentration.
♥The accent Green Jasper is believed to be protective and is credited for stabilizing and healing. Jasper is also one of the birth stones for the month of October. These are marker beads at each count of 7, 14 and 33. Marker beads are helpful place markers when chanting smaller sections of mantras, or are used as gentle reminders to bring your focus back if it happens to wander during your meditation.
*The White Jade Guru is a calming, grounding stone that also protects the wearer from negative energies. It brings peace, harmony and luck.
*The Yellow Jade Guru crystal is energetic and stimulating, yet mellow.  It brings joy and happiness.  Teaches the interconnectedness of all beings.  Yellow Jade aids the digestive and elimination systems of the body.
*The Rose Quartz Guru is a stone of the heart and is said to be symbolic of love and beauty. It is credited for restoring youthful qualities, especially as it relates to the skin, and believed to help foster self esteem.
*The Green Fluorite Guru Fluorite is a great stone to calm and relieve anxiety, tension, and stress by detoxifying the emotional body. It can help get rid of mental blocks and similar mental issues.  Fluorite can reduce fear of the future as well as ease anger and depression. Fluorite can remove confusion and mental ""fog"" to create order and harmony in life.
*The Turquoise Guru is thought to attract prosperity and success, influence creativity, and enhance communication skills.  It is also believed that Turquoise protects you from the evil spirits.
*The Blue Lapis Lazuli Guru is a powerful crystal for activating the higher mind and enhancing intellectual ability. It stimulates the desire for knowledge, truth and understanding, and aids the process of learning. It is excellent for enhancing memory.  It is also a stone of friendship and brings harmony in relationships.
*The Green Aventurine GURU is thought to be the luckiest of all crystals, especially in manifesting prosperity and wealth. Green Aventurine’s soothing energy balances the emotional body, guiding one toward inner harmony. It calms nervousness, anger and irritation, and helps dissolve the everyday stress of a hectic lifestyle. It quiets roving thoughts and enhances sleep while providing a gentle grounding effect on one’s vibrational field. It releases the notion that every event must be analyzed. 
♥I sage all the Malas to cleanse the energy before shipping them out.
NOTE: I only use natural and semi-precious stones and crystals to make my Malas, therefore there will be small differences in colors, shapes and sizes.  I carefully choose the stones that go in to each and every piece and I can assure you that your Mala will be aesthetically beautiful.

Me and my girlfriend are in love with these!!! Thank you so much!!!!! I can't wait for my next purchase!!!!!!
♥ I have been practicing yoga for about 2 years now and it’s been a big part of shaping me into a happier and healthier person physically but more importantly mentally.  
I have been introduced to these beautiful necklaces called Mala beads that are commonly used by Hindus and Buddhists to meditate with. They are made of 108 beads and 1 guru bead, which help you keep count while reciting mantras. 
Even if you don’t practice yoga or meditate you can still use these Mala necklaces or bracelets to set your intentions for the day. That way you will always be reminded of what you wanted to achieve.  For me personally it’s maintaining patience…
Or you could just wear them as accessories.  My Malas are all made from genuine healing stones and gold plated accents which are all customizable…so if you have a certain color in mind please let me know and I’d be happy to make it for you. If you would like it on an elastic string instead of a cord, please leave a comment in the comments section.
♥ Care instructions:
Please try to keep away from water and lotions.  The accents are all gold plated and I make sure that I use only quality items but with time and constant use they might lose its color.  In that case you may use a jewelry cloth to clean them. 
♥ I hope you enjoy wearing my pieces as much as I enjoy making them ♥

About my delivery method - important to read!
________________________________________________________________________________________
★Regular shipping - can take up to 30 working days and has no tracking details on the US.
★Eco post - is fast shipping, up to 10 working days tracking number.
★Ems post - is the faster shipping up to 3 working days tracking number.
From my experience I recommend the Eco post, for several reasons:
1. it's arrived significantly faster than the regular shipping.
2. Eco post has shipment tracking  - makes it easier to track the shipment in anytime.
3. The price difference between the regular and the eco is not significant.
♥♥♥ So I highly recommend choose the ECO post ♥♥♥
