This case is in vintage condition with a charming shabby chic finish to the leather (see photos).  The key is no longer with it but it does have clips either side and on the front to ensure that it closes securely.   The silk lining has a mark inside the lid where someone has glued it down and there are a couple of water stains on the base but aside from this the material is in good overall condition.

1348,Vintage (c. 1975) Six Million Dollar Man board game by Parker Brothers.  Complete!,"
            Vintage (c.1975) Six Million Dollar Man board game by Parker Brothers.
THIS GAME HAS BEEN INVENTORIED AND IS 100% COMPLETE.
Game overview:  Four bionic men each claim to have Steve Austin's powers. Your job is to prove that you are the real Six Million Dollar Man. The computer spinner reads out your moves and gives you the power to handle assignments. You will take part in dangerous missions. Each assignment will make you stronger. The stronger you become the faster you will move around the board and back to the Bionic Research Lab where you will win the game.  
Game and box condition:  This game is 100% complete, as stated.  The game box is in GOOD condition for its age with some shelf wear and some blemishes to the front box lid but no torn or broken corners.  The game box holds together well, has its original inserts to keep the game components sorted and the graphics on the box are still legible.  
A great bit of 70s nostalgia for those of us who used to watch Lee Majors do his stuff as the original Bionic Man.

4009,"NEW OLD Stock 1950s Swiss Army Backpack, Swiss Army Rucksack, extra straps, Swiss Military Leather Canvas Bag, FHD Rucksack Backpack","
            A very special piece from the 1950s: an UNUSED lighter-style Swiss Military or Army backpack or rucksack, made from canvas and dark grey leather. 
**As well as being 'New Old Stock', this bag's additional offering is the three extra leather straps, one on the top and two on the side (see Photos 1 and 3). 
The rucksack's thick outer layer is made from the very popular 'salt and pepper' canvas, which comes across as a mossy, olive green color. 
The shoulder and front straps of the bag are made with strong grey leather. The same leather is also used to line the pockets and top flap. 
The backpack is relatively light to carry but is very, very sturdy. For those interested in using this backpack as a 'carry-on' bag on an aeroplane, this bag is extremely flexible and it can be 'squished' to fit within carry-on measurements. 
Beautifully crafted and hand-stitched, this bag was truly made to last a lifetime. 
CONDITION: As mentioned above, this backpack is 'brand new' old stock from the 1950s. It has never been used and is in the same crisp and clean condition as it was when it was produced around 60 years ago! 
DIMENSIONS:
Height 21.5"" (top to bottom)
Width 16"" (facing bag from left to right)
Depth 6"" (taken from the bottom of the bag)
Weight is approx. 1.1kg

            I love these hanky girl packages! This is the only one I have found that is for Christmas and it has been a part of my extensive Christmas handkerchief collection for many, many years. 
The hanky is white with lace edging and embroidered red poinsettias. It has never been removed from the box.
This would be a super addition to a collection or a gorgeous (and thoughtful) gift for a hanky collector! 
Please note: as with all my listings, the quoted shipping is a best guess estimate only. I refund all overages above 2.00 whether it is a single item purchase or multiple items in a single transaction.        ",38.00,4.9886,"Vintage item

            Pet Memorial Shadow Box: Dog Memorial Shadow Box, Cat Memorial, Pet Memorial Box, In Memory Of
This high-quality 8x10"" pet memorial shadow box is a perfect way to display your cherished pet mementos. Each pet memorial shadow box is custom made to suit the unique bond that you shared.
TO ORDER, copy the following and paste it in the ""notes to seller' section when checking out (for your convenience, so you don't have to reference the listing when ordering to make sure all of the relevant information is included:
Pet's name:
Dates to include:
Design #:
Design/layout preferences:
AND THEN
Select mounting preference: 'Buyer Mounts' or 'Seller Mounts' (see FAQ below for more details)
FAQ
WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THIS SHADOW BOX?
8"" tall, 10"" wide, and approx 2.5"" deep
DO YOU SELL A LARGER SIZE?
Yes! It is not the exact same shadow box, but it is an 11x14. Listing for the larger item is here:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/483224831/pet-memorial-shadow-box-large-dog
HOW DO I GET MY DOG'S COLLAR, PAW PRINT, AND PICTURE INSIDE?
Two options:
1) I send you the shadow box and you mount the items (select Buyer Mounts)
2) You send the items to me, I mount, and send back to you (select Seller Mounts)*
*If you select 'Seller Mounts,' I will send you instructions on how to get the items to me
* You will need to send the actual print you would like me to use; I do not have the high-quality print capaibilities that these projects merit
DO I GET TO SEE WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE?
I will send you a proof of your design prior to completing the shadow box. Please remember to check your Etsy messages to review your proof. 
REGARDING THE PHOTO:
- please send me a high-quality print, no larger than a 4x6 
- I do not recommend having anyone but the pet in the photo, otherwise it seems as though everyone in the photo is being memorialized (although that may be the case and then it is fine)
Please note:
- The backing of the shadow box has a foam layer so you can pin-mount items
- I use a mix of archival-quality tape, hot glue, and pins to mount the items to the back, depending on the materials
- I will arrange the items and vinyl in a way that is visually pleasing - not too busy
- You can provide any layout suggestions, but you can also trust my artistic abilities
Items we can include:
- paw prints
- photo
- collar
- tags
- their favorite biscuit
- their favorite toy        ",38.00,4.9882,"Handmade item

            Free Shipping on this item ! 
Regular Price: 199
Sale Price: 179
This wood chandelier is unique for its textured finish and size.  There aren't many lighting pieces with great shape and attention to detail, like the distressing and rustic texture on this chandelier. This antiqued white (almost cream) cottage chandelier can go just about anywhere you want to add a one of a kind look - above a kitchen island, entries and hallways, bathrooms, and what a cute addition for a little girl's bedroom or in your vacation home.
Dimensions:  21"" high x 12 1/2"" deep; takes one 60 watt candelabra bulb (not included). This fixture is an actual light and needs to be hard wired (which means wired into the ceiling - it is not a plug in chandelier) and it DOES include a ceiling cap. Length of cord/chain is 72 inches. Seller does not include hanging instructions. 
I buy these fixtures as a supply and custom paint them. This piece comes standard painted antiqued white and distressed. The best representation of this color is shown in picture 4.
PLEASE NOTE: If you order this piece as standard as standard antiqued white it will ship in 1-2 business days. If you would like it painted a custom color, the wait time is approximately 10-12 weeks from the order date.        ",149.00,4.9521,"Materials:  wood, paint, wax, glaze, metal, chalk paint

* If you purchase the 2.5cm size from this listing, you may pick among the 80 colors that we sell.  To find colors available, look at the shop section ""Felt Balls - Solid Colors"" . 
These felt balls are just absolutely beautiful!  They are by far much more uniform in size and color than other felt balls that we have come across. Of course, slight differences in size and color are inherent due to its handmade nature but that just adds to the characteristic of each ball! 
Use these balls to make wreaths, garlands, brooches, bouquets and more!  They are super easy to pierce through with a needle and thread or simply use a hot glue gun to make them stick to most surfaces.
These felt balls are imported from a manufacturer in Nepal that practices fair trade.   This means they pay fair wages, have good working condition, and do not employ child labor.  Azo free dyes are were used to make the balls. 
*** Due to it's small nature, these balls should not be used as a toy and should be kept away from children under the age of 4.

            Edwardian Spat Boots, Black & Gray Leather
ca. early 1900s
Hanover. black and gray leather two tone button
up spat shoes.  Stamped on the bottoms ""Hanover""
with Goodyear rubber heels and leather soles. They
have pull tabs at the back with ""The Hanover Shoe
Co."", which was founded in 1899.  The interiors are
cotton cloth which was common for shoes made
from this time.  Heavy gold/brass stud button ups.
Amazing handsewn soles.  They have never been
worn, purchased from the estate of a former shoe
store owner who must have held onto these beauties
for many, many years.  They are in mint condition.
Black and gray (gray is a bit darker than in photos).
Here is a great link for more info;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover_Shoe
They are not sized, but judging from the insole
measurements think they may work for a mens
8 - 8.5 US with a very narrow width, however best
to verify all measurements well and check out the
link below for size conversions.
Measures; 11 1/8"" soles, 10.25"" insoles, 3 5/8"" width,
5.75"" height, 1"" heels.
http://www.zappos.com/c/shoe-size-conversion
These are awesome antique boots in amazing condition.
About the only flaw I can see is one of the fabric pull
ups that has torn on the right boot (think it may be
made with silk).
Thanks for viewing.
