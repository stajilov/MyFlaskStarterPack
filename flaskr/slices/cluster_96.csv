All items come from a smoke-free, chemical-free, and pet-friendly environment. I do have one cat but she is terrible at gift wrapping so I don’t usually ask her for her help. My shop items are also stored in a room that she does not have access to, but since cat hair can possibly be transferred from my clothing please let me know if you have allergies or sensitivities to cats and I will take extra precautions. 
I combine all items, where possible, to save you on shipping fees. The shipping fees listed cover the cost of shipping plus the materials used to get your item(s) to you safely and securely! My turnaround time is typically 2-4 business days or less, unless you have requested a custom order. 
International buyers are responsible for all customs and/or value added tax (VAT) fees.
If you have any questions about my shipping and/or return policies, please view my shop policies page before checkout:

Sending a gift? I can gift-wrap at no extra charge and send your recipient a note on a small gift tag as well. Please let me know in the “notes to buyer” section at checkout that your purchase is a gift and what you would like the gift tag to say, should you opt for one.

            IMPORTANT: Please read before purchasing. 
This is a made to order listing and you will not receive the sculpture in the photo although she will be very very similar. The processing time for my custom orders are currently 5 weeks as this gives me time to order supplies and take my time with your piece as nothing good comes from rushing.  Also due to the nature of how I recieve orders your order might not be sent on the exact shipping date as I can only make it to the post office once a week so please let me know before purchasing if you need your little ones for a gift or a specific date so I can allow plenty of time for it to arrive to you. Please read the information below to see what colours are available for this little one and to make my job a whole lot easier please write your preferences in the note section of the order at checkout so I can keep an easy track of your colour preferences. Thanks so much for looking and please don't hesitate to contact me should you have any questions. Warmest Faery Blessings, Celia
This listing is for 1 cute little mushroom faery made to order. 
As each fairy is an OOAK (original one of a kind) and hand made each one will be slightly different from the other so please keep this in mind! There are two little ones to show you as an example of what you might receive. They will however all be roughly 1 and a half inches and decorated in moss. Please don't hesitate to message me should you have any questions!
**Also please note that this listing is not for the fairy pictured, she is an example of what will be sent when an order is placed.**
Please make sure to write any specifics and details you would like me to keep in mind with your order in the note section of the transaction instead of messaging me them, it really makes my work so much easier! Thanks for looking! <3 <3 <3

12356,MADE TO ORDER Raw Diamond Earrings Rough Diamond Earring Natural Diamond Earring Wedding Earrings Bridal Studs Mothers Day Earrings,"
            This is for a MADE TO ORDER pair of earrings similar in style and size to the pictures above.
If you have a specific request on the size, shape or color of stone please let me know otherwise these earrings will be similar to the above photo's.
These earrings are small.
Gemstones are raw California Diamonds, both are clear/translucent in color.
Earrings and posts made of solid sterling silver.
California - Lake County Diamonds are quartz.
Science has its own explanation for these wonders of nature. Lake County has been the scene of incredible volcanic activity throughout its ancient past. Mount Konocti, the area's defining landmark, is a dormant volcano where past lava flows of magma and basalt were contained under enormous pressure with temperatures of not less than 1,112 Fahrenheit. Heat and pressure resulted in the formation of beta silicon dioxide crystals - Lake County Diamonds - of unsurpassed clarity and the finest optical quality. 
Lake County Diamonds are mostly clear and very hard, ranking from 7.5 to 8 (and possibly as high as 9) on the Mohs Scale, and like all diamonds, they can cut glass. They have been used commercially and industrially, but are in greatest demand as semi-precious gems. Lake County Diamonds may be set uncut for a rough natural look, or faced to set off their inner fire which compares in brilliance to African carbon diamonds.        ",58.00,4.8599,"Handmade item

            Sitting here watching reviving of the sun
By a lake full of peacock colored ripples
Hiding here listening to “ Pavane pour une infante defunte”
By a window full of rain dancing outside
*****************************
A skirt for peacock princess or queen, inspired from Ravel’s debut piano work. Asymmetrical, romantic, a little sorrow and a little crazy all at once. 
* With fashion jewelry inspired over long waist strings decorated with wooden beads, silver bells and peacock feathers. You may wear it as necklace as well since it is detachable. It is detachable so that you can machine wash the skirt.
* Asymmetrical cutting, shape and length of the skirt adjustable with four drawing strings by sides. We make the slits for strings in slightly different length to get a unique touch; please do take a moment to understand this detail. The drawing strings can be knotted to be earthy and simple bowknots. 
* The shape and length of the skirt is adjustable with two out-seam drawing strings, there will be beautiful ripple like pleats all around you.
* Quality linen fabric, perfectly constructed textile and touch. It is difficult to justify the quality by pictures, it is the most tricky part of online shopping. It is our goal from this year, we only use the best fabrics we can find, online shopping is not just impulse purchase by pretty pictures, unique designs deserve quality fabrics even they are humbly priced. 
* Peacock feather is the only feather we will use for designs, it is stunningly beautiful, and doesn’t need to kill the bird to get, so it goes with our animal friendly policy. It is too beautiful to be true, the first question most people see it in real life will ask “ is it really real?” The illustration was finished early this year, we begin making it until now we find reliable supply for top quality big eye peacock feathers from Thailand (love to work with Thai people!). 
* The skirt is easy to wear and versatile, can be dressed down or dress up, goes with Less is More off the shoulder top or a simple shirt you already have. It can be a strapless dress as well. It can be worn with jacket for a unique fall and winter look as well.
* Support 7 days return to get full refund on item without any reason. 
* Designed and handmade by honest family company, ship worldwide, we will use express shipping by default, buy more, only charge one item's shipping.
* Details: 
1. Elastic waist
2. ankle length (accommodable to mid-calf length)
3. sitting on low waist by default(accommodable to natural waist or around belly button)

            Here it is... a shorter version of the beloved Day Tripper Hoodie Dress. I totally love this!
Made with vibrant colors set against an earthy brown back ground. This dress is ALIVE and will make you feel like dancing :)
Comes with a hoodie that can be left up or down. Wear with leggings or just as a short dress. Beautiful, fun, playful, vibrant.
This is a LIGHTWEIGHT cotton fabric, so it is best as a summertime dress!  The fabric is light but also stretchy.  Some women have worn this during the winter, with leggings and even with sleeves or gloves.  
Many women write me with concerns about their bust size fitting, and rest assured, so far I have not had an problems with women's busts fitting, as there is plenty of stretch and room up top!
