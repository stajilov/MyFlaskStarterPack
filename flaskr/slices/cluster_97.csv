HISTORY OF MERRYTHOUGHT BEARS.
Merrythought bears came relatively late to the early bear scene in the UK, with the company being established in 1930. 
The traditional bear from this company came in ten different sizes in gold mohair and various coloured art silks. 
Merrythought teddy bears are still hand finished to this day and have always been considered very high quality British bears.

1251,"SALE Antique amethyst ring - Victorian vintage amethyst lyre ring, stick pin ring conversion with light purple amethyst cabochon","
            This antique Victorian stick pin ring is a ring conversion from an original estate stick pin/hat pin. The pin was formed to create the new shank of the ring, so no gold was wasted! Talk about sustainable jewelry...
The center stone is a purple amethyst cabochon, and the gold tested and was marked as 14k prior to the conversion. This ring is a size 5.5 and is easily sizable by your local jeweler.
This little beauty will be hard to let go! It's lightweight and dainty, and the ring head design has almost a Middle Eastern flair to it, although someone mentioned it also looks like a lyre!
The ring head measures 12mm tall by 13.5mm wide, and the amethyst measures approx. 4x6mm.
Shipping:
This ring will ship in an Anueva Jewelry reusable gift box with a free polishing cloth. The package will be insured and require signature confirmation. Please be sure to use an address that will have someone available to sign during mail delivery times.

✔Story
Formerly part of a traditional Berber tradition, but now an eyecatcher in the bedroom of every interior and vintage lover!
The handira, or also known as a 'wedding blanket’, according to Berber tradition, was entirely handmade by the bride's relatives. Wire to wire the handira spun into a whole and the hundreds of sequins were put on one by one by hand.
All of this, so the bride's 'blanket' could be wrapped around her body on her wedding day, on her way to her husbands house. Because of the countless sequins the whole village heard the bride arrive to the village.
The handira was a symbol for fertility, happiness, and serves to protect against evil.
Today, a must-have that should not be missing in your home. A stylish vintage piece of Morocco.
Use it on your bed as a bedspread or on your couch for decoration, use it as a carpet or hang it on the wall. Either way it is a real eyecatcher in your interior!        ",211.00,5.0,"Vintage item from the 1980s

8774,Essential Oil Roller Bottle Labels--10 mL--Script,"
            Personalized essential oil roller bottle labels. 
Vinyl decals are ideal for labeling your essential oil rollers to keep them organized! These labels also make great gifts for your fellow essential oil friends or as giveaways for oil parties.
This listing is for custom labels that fit 10 mL roller bottles. Approximate size measures 1.75 inches long and .75 inches tall. The perfect size for your rollers! If you need labels to fit a bottle SMALLER than 10 mL please specify that upon purchasing.
Please take into consideration when choosing label names that 10 mL bottles are only approximately 2 inches long. If the label name is too long the vinyl becomes difficult to work with. If possible, keep label names 6-8 characters long.
These labels are NOT available for 5 mL roller bottles. The font becomes too small and is too thin to work with. If you would like roller bottle labels for 5 mL bottles please see my other font listings.
*Roller bottles not included*
Some examples for labels include:
-Wellness
-Stress
-Allergy
-Sleep
-Immune
-Focus
-Anxiety
-Calming
-Headache
To order simply select the quantity and include a note to the seller including your label requests. Labels are also available in silver and white.
**Upon ordering PLEASE INCLUDE A NOTE TO SELLER with the label names you would like**If you do not include the names you will receive a variety of labels listed in the photo**If you send a separate message at a later time your labels may already be packaged and ready to ship before your message is received**

10442,Handcrafted Cajon - Drum Box,"
            I'm a drummer and a furniture maker, so I don't know why it took me so long to put the two together! The cajons (drum boxes) that I build have a distinctive snare sound when played near the top of the front face and a great bass sound when played at the center of the face. The cajons measure 12"" x 12"" x 18"" (approx.). They are built from all hardwood Baltic Birch material with quality furniture joinery, unlike some homemade pieces I've seen. I have the cajons available in either a cherry or walnut finish (please indicate your preference in your order) which allows them to feel at home in a living room or on stage. They sound as good or better than commercially available pieces, but at a significantly lower price (95). (Check out my reviews for what a few of my satisfied customers had to say about the cajons!)
In most cases, your item will be shipped with tracking info the next business day after your order. 
*** Note: This item uses Etsy’s ‘Calculated Shipping’ which uses Priority Main and bases shipping cost on your zip code. There may be alternative shipping methods which would be less expensive, particularly for states more than 400 miles from Ohio. Contact me with your zip code to see if another shipping method might work better for you. Thanks. ***

10698,"Hellraiser Puzzle Box, Lemarchand's box, Lament Configuration, Richly Stained Wood, Detailed Etched Brass","
            Lemarchand's box is a fictional lock puzzle or puzzle box appearing in horror stories by Clive Barker, or in works based on his original stories. The best known of these boxes is the Lament Configuration, which features prominently throughout the ""Hellraiser"" movie series.
Very meticulously created replica of the ""Hellrasier"" box from the famed movies.   Finely detailed CNC milled brass metal, 36 gauge!, and richly stained wood make this a great gift for any horror fan.  I am a professional Jewelry Designer by trade and thus know how to professionally mill the brass plates and can guarantee the detail is exquisite.  The brass plates are nailed down with little brass brads, not glued! This insures that the brass plates will never lift or peel which is a problem with other boxes sold that are only glued and lacquered down.  This is a lifetime heirloom! Each box does have a clear lacquered finish for protection as well.  Why is my box less expensive than others on the market of the same quality?  I have cut out the middle man and produce everything on the box myself which has driven down the cost.  Box measures ""3.5 x ""3.5 x ""3.5

Comes in an elegant, black, velvet ring box and a white cardboard box.
Ready to give away as a gift.
                        Ring  and Band Description:
- Both rings are made out of 14 karat solid White and Rose Gold, Stones are all set in a 4 prong setting to make sure the stones are       set nice and tight
- the MAIN stone is a round cut and its centre dimension is about  7.0 mm 
- side stones measure around 1.5-1.7 and 1.2 -1.3 mm each in diameter
- the total carat weight of all stones combined is 2 carat
- simulated diamonds with excellent cut and clarity
For FREE resizing please see production time below.
..................................................................................................
Production time:
All rings are cast in the standard 6.5.
I do  free resizing for sizes between 4.5- 8. Other sizes (smaller or bigger) need to be cast and therefore might take a few weeks (depends on how much work I have). But please feel free to message me for a more up to date processing time on that.
Also there is an additional CA 20 charge for sizes bigger than 8 since more gold needs to be added. Processing time for that may vary as well  and take a bit longer than usual. Please message me for processing time as well.
You can also message me for any questions or requests.
...................................................................................................
STONE DESCRIPTION :
These stones are Simulated crystals that have been treated. Meaning that the upper layer of these crystals has been treated with man-made diamond crystals in order to  create a diamond top that is made out of pure carbon to give the stones their unique sparkle and fire.
Also their optical, physical properties and durability are closer to natural stones than any other simulated.
In short: you will get stones with the same beauty and sparkle as real diamonds,but for only a fraction of the price.        ",249.05,4.9787,"Handmade item

The Gold plating of my rings is 3 times as thick, as the one of other sellers or the overall market standard of 0.5 micron - this ensures a 3 time longer Lifetime - in fact with proper care 3 micron can last a many many years.

20487,Narwhal Hat winter animal hats,"
            If you had a pet Narwhal what would you name it?  The narwhal survives in extremely cold weather and you will too as this hat has two layers of polar fleece.  Great addition to the wardrobe of an active outdoor personality. Also would be an easy Halloween costume idea.  Choose from three different colors; black, blue and gray.  The blue is a tie dye that gives the illusion that it is underwater which is cool but also means that it will not be identical to the picture.
 
This listing will fit the average adult.  The fabric has some stretch and will fit up to 22 inch head circumference.  This is what will ship unless you leave me a message at checkout about needing a larger or small size. Please specify at checkout in the notes to seller and allow 2-10 days to accommodate your request.

Every animal hat is tenderly handcut, handsewn using my own thoughtful design.   The hat is then lint rolled and neatly packaged for mailing in a biodegradeable shipping bag. Thanks for buying handmade in the USA!

20564,Hand painted silk scarf - Butterfly wing- butterfly scarves- chiffon scarf,"
            Hi!
This is 100% pure silk and hand painted one-of-a-kind piece of wearable art.
""Butterfly wing"" scarf is painted on 100% pure silk. As it's name it is a whole butterfly wing with rich overflowing yellow and orange colors. It is a small scarf to wear it on the neck or like a beautiful accessory to your bag.
It is round cutted and hand sewn with pure silk hem at the edges to look like a real butterfly wing.
** After the many requests for longer version of my favourite Butterfly wing scarf- now you can choose between two sizes**
 - Small wing scarf - size approx.140 cm x 35cm, approx. 55"" x 14"".  
 - Long wing scarf - size approx.160 cm x 35 cm, approx. 63"" x 14"". 
The scarf is with hand sewn pure silk  hem. The silk is semi-transparent 100% italian natural chiffon.
**This scarf is made to order and I will paint it especially for you! 
So If you want I can change the colors upon your wish - just leave me a massage! Otherwise I will make it original colour- overflowing yellow and orange palette.On the example pictures are shown  some  other versions of my  long butterfly wing scarf  in different colors.
 I'll need approx. 10-14 days to complete it and set the colors  by professional steaming process, so the silk dye bonds with the silk fibres at the molecular level. Colors are permanently fixed and sun tolerant - they will never fade.
 Because this scarf is entirely  hand painted so slightly differences may occur - but this will make it even more unique piece of wearable art.
 It's a perfect gift: unique, personal and elegant. Just for a special lady.
""Butterfly wing"" silk scarf comes to you in a beautiful gift box with care instructions and signed by me certificate of authenticity to be guaranteed that you are an owner of 100% handmade and unique piece of art.
If you want any inscriptions on the scarf - just leave me a message and I will contact you for details as color and text.
For any questions or if you want something made exclusively for you don't hesitate to contact me!
